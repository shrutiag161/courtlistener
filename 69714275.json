Plaintiffs allege that the\n\n        Government violated federal law when it terminated thousands of probationary federal\n\n        employees without following the procedures required for a reduction in force, including\n\n        advance notice to the affected States. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502; 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.803(b). The\n\n        district court agreed with Plaintiffs and entered a preliminary injunction requiring the\n\n        Government to reinstate the probationary employees who reside or work in Plaintiff States\n\n        and refrain from further alleged reductions in force except in compliance with the notice\n\n        requirements of \u00a7 3502. Maryland v. USDA, --- F. Supp. 3d ---, 2025 WL 973159, at *40-\n\n        42 (D. Md. April 1, 2025).\n\n              The Government now asks us to stay the district court\u2019s preliminary injunction.\n\n        Among other things, the Government argues that the States lack Article III standing to\n\n        challenge the terminations and that the district court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction\n\n        because the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, Pub. L. No. 95-454, provides the exclusive\n\n        means for review of personnel actions taken against federal employees.\n\n              Having reviewed the record, the district court\u2019s opinion, and the parties\u2019 briefing,\n\n        we agree with the Government that it has satisfied the factors for a stay under Nken v.\n                                                   4\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248    Doc: 42           Filed: 04/09/2025 Pg: 5 of 12\n             Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB        Document 139 Filed 04/09/25           Page 5 of 12\n\n\n\n        Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 426 (2009). The Government is likely to succeed in showing the\n\n        district court lacked jurisdiction over Plaintiffs\u2019 claims, and the Government is unlikely to\n\n        recover the funds disbursed to reinstated probationary employees. Cf. Dep\u2019t of Educ. v.\n\n        California, No. 24A910, 2025 WL 1008354, at *1 (U.S. Apr. 4, 2025) (per curiam). The\n\n        Supreme Court has stayed a similar preliminary injunction issued by the United States\n\n        District Court for the Northern District of California. See OPM v. AFGE, No. 24A904,\n\n        2025 WL 1035208, at *1 (U.S. Apr. 8, 2025) (mem.). We therefore grant the Government\u2019s\n\n        motion for a stay of the preliminary injunction pending this appeal. The Clerk will set an\n\n        expedited briefing schedule.\n\n               Entered at the direction of Judge Rushing, with the concurrence of Judge Wilkinson.\n\n        Judge Benjamin filed a separate dissenting opinion.\n\n                                                          For the Court\n\n                                                          /s/ Nwamaka Anowi, Clerk\n\n\n\n\n                                                     5\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248    Doc: 42            Filed: 04/09/2025 Pg: 6 of 12\n             Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB         Document 139 Filed 04/09/25           Page 6 of 12\n\n\n\n        DEANDREA GIST BENJAMIN, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n\n               The majority votes to stay the preliminary injunction pending the resolution of the\n\n        appeal. The district court entered a well-reasoned memorandum opinion and order granting\n\n        a preliminary injunction, and then denied a motion for stay pending appeal. For the below\n\n        reasons and those explained in thorough detail by the district court, I would deny the\n\n        Government\u2019s motion.\n\n\n\n                                                      I.\n\n                                                      A.\n\n               As a threshold matter, per the district court\u2019s order, the States1 clearly have standing\n\n        to challenge the process by which the Government has engaged in mass firings.2 To\n\n        establish standing, \u201cthe plaintiff must have a \u2018 \u201cpersonal stake\u201d \u2019 in the case.\u201d TransUnion\n\n        LLC v. Ramirez, 594 U.S. 413, 423 (2021) (quoting Raines v. Byrd, 521 U.S. 811, 819\n\n        (1997)). To prove a personal stake, \u201cplaintiffs must be able to sufficiently answer the\n\n        question: \u2018 \u201cWhat\u2019s it to you?\u201d \u2019 \u201d Id. (quoting Antonin Scalia, The Doctrine of Standing\n\n\n               1\n                Plaintiff States are a consortium of nineteen states (Maryland, Minnesota, Arizona,\n        California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan,\n        Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont,\n        Wisconsin) and the District of Columbia.\n               2\n                 This is an important distinction. The Government repeatedly mischaracterizes the\n        basis of the States\u2019 claims, suggesting that the States are attempting to sue on behalf of\n        their respective citizens for alleged unlawful firings. This mischaracterization not only\n        misses the point but\u2014more seriously\u2014distracts from the States\u2019 actual alleged harm. The\n        States were entitled to proper notice, which the Government did not give. That is the basis\n        for the instant suit.\n\n                                                      6\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248    Doc: 42            Filed: 04/09/2025 Pg: 7 of 12\n             Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB         Document 139 Filed 04/09/25           Page 7 of 12\n\n\n\n        as an Essential Element of the Separation of Powers, 17 Suffolk U. L. Rev. 881, 882\n\n        (1983)). A satisfactory answer to this question requires a plaintiff to show \u201c(i) that he\n\n        suffered an injury in fact that is concrete, particularized, and actual or imminent; (ii) that\n\n        the injury was likely caused by the defendant; and (iii) that the injury would likely be\n\n        redressed by judicial relief.\u201d Id. (citing Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560\u2013\n\n        61 (1992)).\n\n               The Supreme Court has recognized that certain intangible injuries, including an\n\n        \u201cinformational injury,\u201d can support standing. See, e.g., Fed. Election Comm\u2019n v. Akins,\n\n        524 U.S. 11, 24\u201325 (1998); Pub. Citizen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 491 U.S. 440, 449 (1989).\n\n        \u201cA statutory violation alone,\u201d however, \u201cdoes not create a concrete informational injury\n\n        sufficient to support standing.\u201d Dreher v. Experian Info. Sols., Inc., 856 F.3d 337, 345 (4th\n\n        Cir. 2017) (citing Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 578 U.S. 330, 341\u201342 (2016)). Instead, a\n\n        \u201cconstitutionally cognizable informational injury requires that a person lack access to\n\n        information to which he is legally entitled and that the denial of that information creates a\n\n        \u2018real\u2019 harm with an adverse effect.\u201d Id. (quoting Spokeo, 578 U.S. at 339\u201340).\n\n               By this standard, the States\u2019 informational injury cannot be a \u201cdead end,\u201d as the\n\n        Government claims. See Mot. for stay pending appeal at 1. First, pursuant to 5 U.S.C.\n\n        \u00a7 3502(d), the Government was legally required to inform the States at least 60 days before\n\n        any reduction in force (\u201cRIF\u201d). See also 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.803(b). The Government failed\n\n        to do so, thereby depriving the States of information to which they were legally entitled\n\n        and satisfying the first requirement of a constitutionally cognizable informational injury.\n\n        See Dreher, 856 F.3d at 345. Next, as discussed in depth by the district court, the denial\n                                                  7\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248    Doc: 42           Filed: 04/09/2025 Pg: 8 of 12\n             Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB        Document 139 Filed 04/09/25         Page 8 of 12\n\n\n\n        of this notice has, and will continue to, cause real harm with significant adverse effects.\n\n        See Mem.

ECF No. 125) at 10\u201316.3 Such adverse effects include,\n\n        but are not limited to, an increase in unemployment benefits applications, an increase in\n\n        the resources required to investigate this influx in unemployment benefits applications,\n\n        additional financial and labor costs associated with the sudden strain placed on rapid\n\n        response programs without advance notice, unanticipated loss of tax revenue, and the loss\n\n        of support from federal employees who were working with various state agencies.4 See id.\n\n        These harms, among others, plainly satisfy the concreteness requirement and thus provide\n\n        the necessary grounds for Article III standing. See Dreher, 856 F.3d at 345.\n\n               Further, the district court correctly distinguished this case from United States v.\n\n        Texas, 599 U.S. 670 (2023). Asking the Government \u201cto change its arrest or prosecution\n\n        policies so that the Executive Branch makes more arrests or initiates more prosecutions\u201d is\n\n        a far cry from requiring the Government to adhere to a statutory notice requirement. See\n\n        id. at 677. The former \u201crun[s] up against the Executive\u2019s Article II authority to enforce\n\n\n\n               3\n                Page numbers for citations to ECF documents utilize the document\u2019s native\n        numbering.\n               4\n                 The Government\u2019s argument regarding the harms suffered by the States as a result\n        of the lack of statutory notice is concerning. See Mot. for stay pending appeal at 13\n        (arguing that allowing standing \u201cbased on downstream harms to state budgets and\n        operations from the termination of probationary employees\u201d is \u201ca recipe for any state to\n        micromanage the activities of the federal government\u201d and \u201cirreconcilable with Supreme\n        Court precedent\u201d). Requiring the federal government to adhere to statutory notice\n        requirements as set forth by federal law can hardly be considered \u201cmicromanaging.\u201d As\n        explained below, the Government had the opportunity to conduct the RIF according to\n        statutory procedure and chose not to do so.\n\n                                                    8\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248    Doc: 42            Filed: 04/09/2025 Pg: 9 of 12\n             Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB         Document 139 Filed 04/09/25           Page 9 of 12\n\n\n\n        federal law\u201d and seeks to mandate something of the Government that was not already\n\n        required. Id. at 678. The latter merely asks the Government to comply with a required\n\n        procedure.\n\n               In the same vein, the relationship between the action (or inaction) by the\n\n        Government and the alleged harm is also distinct. In Texas, the states sought damages for\n\n        the costs associated with incarceration and social services based on the Government\u2019s\n\n        failure to exercise its discretion\u2014i.e., its discretionary inaction. Id. at 674, 684\u201385. Here,\n\n        the alleged harms, namely, the unexpected increased financial burden placed on rapid\n\n        response programs, are a result of the Government\u2019s failure to adhere to statutory notice\n\n        requirements\u2014i.e., its actions contrary to law. One is tangentially related to actions that\n\n        the Government was not required to take, while the other is directly related to an action\n\n        the Government was required to and failed to take. For these reasons, and those aptly\n\n        explained by the district court, Texas is inapplicable here.5\n\n\n\n\n               5\n                 On April 8, 2025, the Supreme Court stayed the preliminary injunction entered by\n        the United States District Court for the Northern District of California in its similar\n        probationary employee RIF case. See OPM v. AFGE, No. 24A904 (U.S. Apr. 8, 2025).\n        The Ninth Circuit had denied a motion to stay pending appeal. See Am. Fed\u2019n of Gov\u2019t\n        Emps., AFL-CIO v. United States Off. of Pers. Mgmt., No. 25-1677, 2025 WL 914823 (9th\n        Cir. Mar. 26, 2025). Like United States v. Texas, 599 U.S. 670 (2023), the decision in\n        AFGE is not applicable to the present case. The Supreme Court specifically noted \u201c[t]he\n        District Court\u2019s injunction was based solely on the allegations of the nine non-profit-\n        organization plaintiffs.\u201d See AFGE, No. 24A904. The basis of standing is different here,\n        where States are suing under a statutory scheme relevant to states.\n\n                                                      9\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 42            Filed: 04/09/2025 Pg: 10 of 12\n            Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB         Document 139 Filed 04/09/25 Page 10 of 12\n\n\n\n               Accordingly, the States have successfully answered the question: \u201cWhat\u2019s it to\n\n        them?\u201d    See TransUnion LLC, 594 U.S. at 423.           Standing based on the alleged\n\n        informational injury is thus appropriate here.\n\n                                                    B.\n\n               Nor does the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (\u201cCSRA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7101\u201335,\n\n        defeat the district court\u2019s jurisdiction. The CSRA \u201cprovides for the original and exclusive\n\n        administrative review of certain labor- and employment-related claims brought by federal\n\n        employees and/or their unions.\u201d Mem. Op. on prelim. inj. at 32. The Government argues\n\n        the CSRA precludes the States\u2019 claims because \u201cat bottom, [they] rest on allegations that\n\n        the government unlawfully terminated probationary employees . . . and the states sought\u2014\n\n        and the district court granted\u2014reinstatement of affected employees.\u201d Mot. for stay\n\n        pending appeal at 21\u201322.\n\n               The States do not dispute that they cannot receive relief under the CSRA\u2014instead,\n\n        they have consistently argued that their harm arises from an independent \u201cstatutory right[]\n\n        to notice.\u201d Mem. in support of motion for prelim. inj. (D. ECF No. 78-1) at 15. I, like the\n\n        district court, am not prepared to accept \u201cthe faulty premise that the States [are] simply\n\n        trying to vindicate the interests of the terminated workers (as opposed to their own and\n\n        separate harms as \u2018state qua states\u2019).\u201d Mem. Op. on prelim. inj. at 33.\n\n               I also cannot ignore the Supreme Court\u2019s analytical framework for assessing\n\n        whether a district court is divested of jurisdiction in favor of the Government\u2019s preferred\n\n        framework. As ably set out by the district court, \u201cpursuant to . . . Thunder Basin Coal Co.\n\n        v. Reich, 510 U.S. 200 (1994), there [is] no reason to believe Congress ha[s] divested the\n                                                    10\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 42             Filed: 04/09/2025 Pg: 11 of 12\n            Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 139 Filed 04/09/25 Page 11 of 12\n\n\n\n        district courts of jurisdiction over the States\u2019 claims in this case.\u201d Mem. Op. on prelim.\n\n        inj. at 31; see also id. at 31\u201333. The Government\u2019s attempt to review the jurisdictional\n\n        question pursuant to Block v. Community Nutrition Institute, 467 U.S. 340 (1984) is\n\n        unavailing and \u201crel[ies] crucially on the idea that there is an identity of interests between\n\n        the States and the fired employees.\u201d Id. at 37; see also id. at 35\u201337. \u201cBut,\u201d as the district\n\n        court made clear, \u201cthat is not so.\u201d Id. at 37.\n\n               For the above reasons, I do not believe the Government can defeat the States\u2019\n\n        standing.\n\n\n\n                                                         II.\n\n               The Government also cannot satisfy the standard for a stay pending appeal. Those\n\n        factors are \u201c(1) whether the stay applicant has made a strong showing that he is likely to\n\n        succeed on the merits; (2) whether the applicant will be irreparably injured absent a stay;\n\n        (3) whether issuance of the stay will substantially injure the other parties interested in the\n\n        proceeding; and (4) where the public interest lies.\u201d Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 434\n\n        (2009) (quoting Hilton v. Braunskill, 481 U.S. 770, 776 (1987)).\n\n               The Government must satisfy all four factors. But I do not believe it can satisfy\n\n        any. I write to highlight the Government\u2019s lack of a convincing argument on irreparable\n\n        harm. See Nken, 556 U.S. at 434\u201335 (2009). The Government asserts that it cannot recover\n\n        salaries it is currently paying to reinstated probationary employees, and that the preliminary\n\n        injunction is a disruption to the CSRA process. See Mot. for stay pending appeal at 25\u2013\n\n        27.\n                                                         11\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 42            Filed: 04/09/2025 Pg: 12 of 12\n            Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB         Document 139 Filed 04/09/25 Page 12 of 12\n\n\n\n               The Government\u2019s monetary injury, if any, is \u201c \u2018self-imposed.\u2019 \u201d See Dep\u2019t of Educ.\n\n        v. California, __ S. Ct. __, __, No. 24A910, 2025 WL 1008354, at *1 (quoting Cuomo v.\n\n        U.S. Nuclear Regul. Comm\u2019n, 772 F.2d 972, 977 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (per curiam)). The\n\n        preliminary injunction order expressly states \u201c[n]othing in this Order prohibits the\n\n        Government from conducting lawful terminations of probationary federal employees\u2014\n\n        whether (1) pursuant to a proper RIF . . . or else (2) for cause . . . under the standards for\n\n        making such determinations set forth in the TRO Memorandum.\u201d Prelim. Inj. order (D.\n\n        ECF No. 126) at 2 n.1. Additionally, if the Government had followed the statutory RIF\n\n        notice procedure, it would have had to pay probationary employees\u2019 salaries for a statutory\n\n        period anyway. See 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.801. And, as explained earlier, the States are not\n\n        alleging a violation of the CSRA, nor are they attempting to step into the probationary\n\n        employees\u2019 place for a CSRA challenge. See Mem. Op. on prelim. inj. at 33\u201337.\n\n\n\n                                                     III.\n\n               I see no reason to stay the district court\u2019s preliminary injunction pending its appeal.\n\n        For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n                                                     12\n\f",

See Dkt Nos. 126, \u00b6 4. Specifically, the Declaration of\n\nJessica Parton, on behalf of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) (see Dkt.

The declaration should have stated that OPM had\n\n46 Affected Probationary Employees (and had reinstated all 46 of these individuals). Accordingly,\n\nDefendants respectfully request that the Court replace the Declaration of Jessica Parton (Dkt. No.\n\n136-1, pp. 27-29), with the attached Corrected Declaration of Jessica M.

PARTON\n\n           Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I, Jessica M. Parton declare as follows:\n\n\n           1.      I am the Supervisory Human Resources Specialist headquartered in Washington,\n\nDC. I make this declaration based on my own personal knowledge, on information contained in\n\nthe records of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), or on information provided to me\n\nby OPM employees.\n\n           2.      I have served in this position since June 10, 2018. In my role at OPM, I am\n\nresponsible for personnel management. I have the responsibility for overseeing the personnel\n\nenterprise and tracking and recording of personnel actions, including terminations. I assist in\n\nensuring that all personnel actions comply with federal law, including those related to probationary\n\nemployees.\n\n           3.      As of Tuesday, April 8, 2025, OPM had forty-six (46) Affected Probationary\n\nEmployees, as defined in paragraph 8(b) of the Preliminary Injunction Order. As of that date,\n\nOPM had reinstated forty-six (46) Affected Probationary Employees.\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 137-1       Filed 04/08/25      Page 2 of 3\n\n\n\n       4.      As of Tuesday, April 8, 2025, OPM communicated Affected Probationary\n\nEmployees\u2019 reinstatement status to each by personal email. One (1) of the emails was returned as\n\nundeliverable, and we are contacting the employee to obtain a valid email address.\n\n       5.      OPM has cancelled all termination personnel actions for all Affected Probationary\n\nEmployees, and all have been placed on paid administrative leave. All Affected Probationary\n\nEmployees have been restored without physical and system (IT) access. We are coordinating\n\nclosely with the payroll office to reconcile Affected Probationary Employees\u2019 annual leave and\n\nintend to offset previously made annual leave payouts with the administrative leave pay to prevent\n\nor limit indebtedness. Leave will be recredited to Affected Probationary Employees\u2019 accounts. All\n\nAffected Probationary Employees have been reinstated to the benefits they were enrolled in prior\n\nto termination, ensuring no break in service. No action is required on the part of Affected\n\nProbationary Employees with respect to benefits. It may take the carriers a few weeks to\n\nappropriately update their systems.\n\n       6.      Forty-six (46) termination personnel actions have been cancelled.\n\n       7.      To date, no Affected Probationary Employee has informed us that they decline\n\nreinstatement. If an Affected Probationary Employee does inform us of a desire to decline\n\nreinstatement on the basis that they now have outside employment that could conflict with Federal\n\nemployment under applicable ethics rules, we will consult with our Office of the General Counsel\n\nto present the Affected Probationary Employee with available options.\n\n       8.      Two of the forty-six (46) Affected Probationary Employees were reinstated to\n\noffices that were subject to a Reduction in Force (RIF). Because the Affected Probationary\n\nEmployees were in the RIF competitive areas and would have been released in the RIFs, we\n\nreinstated those employees and will be issuing them the required RIF notices. They will remain in\n\n\n\n                                                    2\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB         Document 137-1        Filed 04/08/25      Page 3 of 3\n\n\n\na paid administrative leave status pending release at the end of the notice period. Neither of the\n\nRIFs at issue involves competitive areas of fifty (50) or more employees, thus the 5 C.F.R.\n\n351.803(b) notice requirement with respect to states does not apply.\n\n       9.      The Deferred Resignation Program (DRP) has reopened for all employees at OPM\n\nthrough April 14, 2025. With the exception of the two employees described in paragraph eight (8),\n\nwe have offered all Affected Probationary Employees the opportunity to opt into the DRP program\n\nif they so choose.\n\nPursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and\ncorrect.\n                                                            Dated: April 8, 2025\n\n\n                                                            /s/ Jessica M.

I make this Declaration based on my own\npersonal knowledge, on information contained in the records of USDA, or on information provided\nto me by USDA employees. | have served in this position since January 31, 2025, and I have been\nemployed at USDA since 2018. I submitted previous declarations in this matter and rely on and\nincorporate my prior declaration testimony in making this declaration.\n\n2. In my role at USDA, | currently oversee the Department\u2019s Office of Human\nResources Management and | have purview over USDA subagencies\u2019 Chief Operating Officers\nand Human Resources Offices.\n\n3, USDA reinstated and notified the Affected Probationary Employees to the pay\n\nstatus they were in prior to their terminations. The Affected Probationary Employees who are in\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document136-1 Filed 04/08/25 Page 3 of 29\n\npay status were initially placed on administrative leave as part of the phased plan to return the\nemployees to work.\n\n4, Given the large number of Affected Probationary Employees being reinstated,\nUSDA is simultaneously developing and implementing enhanced procedures and tracking the\nDepartment\u2019s progress in returning the Affected Probationary Employees to full duty status. For\nexample, USDA administered an electronic survey through which Affected Probationary\nEmployees can indicate whether they elect to return to full duty status or whether they decline to\nreturn to full duty status. As the tracking system is being developed, some of the data is being\ninput manually by Human Resources personnel and reflecting a more comprehensive and detailed\nperspective of this multi-faceted undertaking. USDA is providing this compliance update based\nin part on this dynamic data set. USDA is also using timekeeping data to ascertain which Affected\nProbationary Employees have returned to full duty status (returned to work) and which Affected\nProbationary Employees remain on administrative leave.\n\n5. Approximately 4,633 Affected Probationary Employees have been returned to full\nduty status or have a confirmed date on which they will return to full duty status.\n\n6. Human Resources personnel continue to try to reach all affected employees by\nemail and telephone to confirm their elections regarding the return to full duty status and, for those\nemployees who elect to return to full duty status, to continue to implement USDA\u2019s phased plan\nto return the Affected Probationary Employees to full duty status. The phased plan considers an\nemployee\u2019s need to access, and availability of, information technology and other equipment;\nLincpasses (badges); systems credentials; workstation readiness; and safety and security of\n\nfacilities. USDA is continuously receiving updates and information from the people in the group\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document136-1 Filed 04/08/25 Page 4 of 29\n\nof Affected Probationary Employees, via the survey and other modes of communication, regarding\n\nthe offer to return to full duty status.\n\nPursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true\n\nand correct.\n\nDated: April 8, 2025\n\nDigitally signed by\nMARY RIC MARY RICE\n\nDate: 2025.04.08\n\n13:46:37 -04'00'\nMARY PLETCHER RICE\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document136-1 Filed 04/08/25 Page 5of 29\n\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF MARYLAND\n\nMaryland, et al.,\n\nCase No. 1:25-cy- -\nPlaintiffs, ase No. 1:25-cv-00748-JKB\n\nv.\nUnited States Department of Agriculture,\n\net al.,\n\nDefendants.\n\nDECLARATION OF TIMOTHY D.

As of Tuesday, April 8, 2025, OPM had forty-seven (47) Affected Probationary\nEmployees, as defined in paragraph 8(b) of the Preliminary Injunction Order. As of that date,\n\nOPM had reinstated forty-seven (47) Affected Probationary Employees.\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document136-1 Filed 04/08/25 Page 28 of 29\n\n4, As of Tuesday, April 8, 2025, OPM communicated Affected Probationary\nEmployees\u2019 reinstatement status to each by personal email. One (1) of the emails was returned as\nundeliverable, and we are contacting the employee to obtain a valid email address.\n\n5. OPM has cancelled all termination personnel actions for all Affected Probationary\nEmployees, and all have been placed on paid administrative leave. All Affected Probationary\nEmployees have been restored without physical and system (IT) access. We are coordinating\nclosely with the payroll office to reconcile Affected Probationary Employees\u2019 annual leave and\nintend to offset previously made annual leave payouts with the administrative leave pay to prevent\nor limit indebtedness. Leave will be recredited to Affected Probationary Employees\u2019 accounts. All\nAffected Probationary Employees have been reinstated to the benefits they were enrolled in prior\nto termination, ensuring no break in service. No action is required on the part of Affected\nProbationary Employees with respect to benefits. It may take the carriers a few weeks to\nappropriately update their systems.\n\n6. Forty-seven (47) termination personnel actions have been cancelled.\n\n7. To date, no Affected Probationary Employee has informed us that they decline\nreinstatement. If an Affected Probationary Employee does inform us of a desire to decline\nreinstatement on the basis that they now have outside employment that could conflict with Federal\nemployment under applicable ethics rules, we will consult with our Office of the General Counsel\nto present the Affected Probationary Employee with available options.\n\n8. Two of the forty-seven (47) Affected Probationary Employees were reinstated to\noffices that were subject to a Reduction in Force (RIF). Because the Affected Probationary\nEmployees were in the RIF competitive areas and would have been released in the RIFs, we\n\nreinstated those employees and will be issuing them the required RIF notices.

Lombard Street Chambers 5A\n\nBaltimore, MD 21201\nMarch 27, 2025\n~ Subject: Notice of Non-Reinstatement Following Mass Terminations at the Department of\nDefense\nDear Judge Bredar,\n\nI am writing to inform you that I was terminated from my probationary position as an Oversight\nEditor at the Department of the Army\u2019s Office of the Inspector General (DAIG) on Friday,\nFebruary 21, 2025, have yet to be reinstated or placed on administrative leave.\n\nI have received no communication from the DoD, including a notice per your request for names\nof terminated employees who have not been reinstated after the ruling my firing was illegal.\n\nAs one of the highest paid employees in my unit I was terminated using my probationary status\nto illegally achieve the goals of a Reduction-in-Force. My termination letter stated, \u201cthis action is\nin accordance with Title 5, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 315, Subpart H, to promote\n\u201cthe efficiency of service.\u201d >\n\nThe above regulation applies to competitive positions, but my position was in the excepted\nservice. Also, the referenced regulation has no requirement to, \u201cpromote the efficiency of\n\n_ service.\u201d These errors strongly indicate my termination was in no way about performance but\nwas rushed through using a template document provided by the Office of Personnel Management\n(OPM) to follow an illegal diktat from OPM.\n\ni\n\nIn addition to others at DAIG, my termination was part of \u201clight firings\u201d of other probationary\nemployees across the agency that took place at the DoD since Feb 21. I know employees in this\ncategory have been reinstated at DoD and at other agencies at issue in recent weeks.\n\nBased on conversations in the office of my direct employer prior to Feb 21, it was widely\nunderstood that DAIG had been ordered to do a budget reduction of 25% and was scrambling to\ncut its work of probationary employees, of which it has very few.\n\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document135 Filed 04/07/25 Page 2of2\n\n\u201c \u2018am submitting: this. letter considering your recent order regarding lists of terminated employees\n\u201cWiio have not b\u00e9erifeinstated. I would greatly appreciate any assistance in my reinstatement.\n\non\n\nMonon\n\nSinteely,\nMe Ne \u201d\n\ntu :33 Elizabeth R. Smith *\u00a5!\n\n",

JKB-25-0748\n\nUNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF *\nAGRICULTURE, et al.,\n\nDefendants.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nMEMORANDUM AND ORDER\n\nOn April 1, 2025, the Court issued a Preliminary Injunction Order pursuant to Federal Rule\nof Civil Procedure 65 and 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 705 that, inter alia, stayed the Government\u2019s recent\nterminations of federal probationary employees and enjoined the Government from conducting\nfuture reductions in force (\u201cRIFs\u201d) except in accordance with the law. (ECF No. 126.) The\nfollowing day, the Government filed a Notice of Appeal. (ECF No. 127.) The appeal was docketed\nwith the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit under case number 25-1338. (ECF\nNo. 129). The appeal has been consolidated with case number 25-1248 (which pertains to the\nGovernment\u2019s appeal of the Court\u2019s earlier Temporary Restraining Order (\u201cTRO\u201d), ECF No. 44),\nwith case number 25-1248 being the lead case. (ECF No. 130.)\n\nNow pending before the Court is the Government\u2019s Motion to Stay Preliminary Injunction\nPending Appeal (the \u201cMotion to Stay\u201d), which the Government filed yesterday evening, April 3.\n(ECF No. 131.) Today, April 4, the Plaintiff States filed their opposition. (ECF No. 133.) The\nGovernment requests that the Court issue its ruling by 2:00 p.m. (ECF No. 131 at 1.) The Motion\n\nto Stay will be denied.\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document134 Filed 04/04/25 Page2of5\n\nBefore turning to the merits of the Motion to Stay, the Court begins with the question of\njurisdiction. See Whitaker v. Monroe Staffing Servs., LLC, 42 F.4th 200, 206 (4th Cir. 2022). \u201cThe\nfiling of a notice of appeal is an event of jurisdictional significance\u2014it confers jurisdiction on the\ncourt of appeals and divests the district court of its control over those aspects of the case involved\nin the appeal.\u201d Griggs v. Provident Consumer Disc. Co., 459 U.S. 56, 58 (1982). However, this\ngeneral rule has some \u201climited exceptions . . . confined to a narrow class of actions that promote\njudicial efficiency and facilitate the division of labor between trial and appellate courts.\u201d Doe v.\nPub. Citizen, 749 F.3d 246, 258 (2014). One such exception comes in the form of Federal Rule of\nCivil Procedure 62(d), which permits a court to \u201csuspend, modify, restore, or grant an injunction\non terms for bond or other terms that secure the opposing party\u2019s rights\u201d while an interlocutory\nappeal is pending.' This rule authorizes a district court to stay its injunction pending appeal, \u201ceven\nafter notice of the appeal has been filed.\u201d 11 Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal\nPractice & Procedure \u00a7 2904 (3d ed. 2024) (collecting cases).\n\nSatisfied that it has jurisdiction to consider the Motion to Stay, the Court turns to the\nrelevant standards. In its TRO Memorandum, the Court reviewed the standards for staying a ruling\npending appeal:\n\nIn deciding whether to issue a stay pending appeal, the Court considers: (1) whether\n\nthe stay applicant has made a strong showing that he is likely to succeed on the\n\nmerits; (2) whether the applicant will be irreparably injured absent a stay; (3)\n\nwhether issuance of the stay will substantially injure the other parties interested in\n\nthe proceeding; and (4) where the public interest lies.\n\n(ECF No. 43 at 55 (quoting Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 434 (2009).) As the Court explained,\n\nthese overlap with the factors that a court considers in deciding whether to grant a preliminary\n\ninjunction under Winter v. Natural Resources Defense Council, 555 U.S. 7 (2008). As a result,\n\n' The bond requirement is waived when the party seeking the stay is the United States. Fed. R. Civ. P.\n65(e).\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document134 Filed 04/04/25 Page 3of5\n\n\u201cTilt is generally logically inconsistent for a court to issue a... preliminary injunction and then\nstay that order, as the findings on which those decisions are premised are almost perfect opposites.\u201d\n(ECF No. 43 at 55.)\n\nThe Government contends that, in this context, the Court need not change its mind as to\nthe correctness of its prior ruling; it need merely determine whether \u201cthe Defendant\u2019s appeal\npresents an admittedly difficult legal question.\u201d (ECF No. 131-1 at 3 (quoting United States v.\nMosby, Crim. No. LKG-22-00007, 2024 WL 3877613, at *3 (D. Md. Aug. 20, 2024).) The Court\nagrees that this approach makes good sense; otherwise, a district court would never stay an order\npending appeal, as \u201cevery court that renders a judgment does so in the belief that its judgment is\nthe correct one.\u201d Woollard v. Sheridan, 863 F. Supp. 2d 462, 477 (D. Md. 2012), rev'd on other\ngrounds sub nom. Woollard v. Gallagher, 712 F.3d 865 (4th Cir. 2013).\n\nHowever, even under the less demanding \u201cadmittedly difficult legal question\u201d standard,\nthe Government falls short. The Court is well aware, of course, that the questions presented in this\ncase are complex and involve issues of first impression. But in its Motion to Stay, the Government\nsimply rehashes the same arguments that the Court considered in detail and rejected in the\nMemorandum accompanying the Preliminary Injunction Order. (See generally ECF No. 125)\nThe Government does not provide any reason to revisit those conclusions; indeed, the Government\ndoes not even engage with the Court\u2019s analysis in any meaningful way. For example, the\nGovernment contends that \u201cDefendants demonstrated that Plaintiffs\u2019 claimed \u2018statutory right of\nnotice\u2019 alone failed to support an \u2018informational injury\u2019 that suffices as an injury-in-fact for\nstanding.\u201d (ECF No. 131-1 at 3.) The Government seems to ignore the lengthy discussion in the\nCourt\u2019s Preliminary Injunction Memorandum on this exact issue, in which the Court explained\n\nthat it \u201cwould be unwilling to accept\u201d a theory of standing based solely on a violation of a statutory\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document134 Filed 04/04/25 Page4of5\n\nright, and that instead a plaintiff claiming an informational injury must show denial of information\nto which they were entitled plus cognizable downstream harms\u2014a requirement that the Court\nfound the States had amply satisfied. (See ECF No. 125 at 18-25.) The Government\u2019s other\narguments are all in a similar vein, repeating arguments that the Court has already considered (in\nmany cases, twice, at both the TRO and Preliminary Injunction stages), without even cursorily\npointing out where, specifically, it believes this Court erred in its analysis. Thus, for the reasons\nstated in both the TRO Memorandum and the Preliminary Injunction Memorandum, the Court\nconcludes that the Government has not identified an \u201cadmittedly difficult legal question\u201d on which\nthe Court may have erred, Ict alone a strong likelihood of success.\n\nMost significantly, even assuming that the Government has identified an \u201cadmittedly\ndifficult legal question,\u201d and assuming further that this showing would suffice to satisfy the first\nstay factor under Nken, the Court would stil] deny the Government\u2019s request. The Government\nprotests that the Court\u2019s order is \u201cextraordinarily burdensome.\u201d (ECF No. 131-1 at 5.) The Court\ndoes not doubt this, and indeed explicitly acknowledged as much in its Preliminary Injunction\nMemorandum, while nevertheless stating that \u201cthe Government cannot engage in far-reaching\nillegal activity and then complain that the remedy is too burdensome.\u201d (ECF No. 125 at 68.)\nMoreover, while the Court continues to recognize the considerable public interests that favor the\nGovernment\u2019s position, it also continues to hold that those interests are outweighed by the public\ninterest in complying with lawful RIF notice procedures and by the magnitude of the harms\nimposed on the States in the absence of immediate injunctive relief.\n\nAs the Court\u2019s Memorandum makes clear, it has not taken the prospect of issuing a\npreliminary injunction against the Government lightly. Courts must respect the limits of their\n\nauthority and must be especially cautious when enjoining the activities of a coequal coordinate\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document134 Filed 04/04/25 Page5of5\n\nbranch of government. But, in our federal system, other actors, such as these Plaintiff States, are\nentitled to seek redress in court\u2014including, in extraordinary circumstances, by obtaining\npreliminary injunctive relief against the federal government. The Court took pains to ensure that\nthe injunction it crafted was no more burdensome to the Government than necessary to redress the\nirreparable harms faced by the Plaintiff States. But the care that the Court took in limiting the\nscope of relief should not be equated with any doubt in the Court\u2019s mind about the necessity of the\nrelief it ordered. That relicf was necessary on April 1, and it remains so today.\n\nFor these reasons, and for those stated in the Court\u2019s Preliminary Injunction Memorandum,\n\n(ECF No. 125), it is ORDERED that the Motion to Stay, (ECF No. 131), is DENIED.\n\nDated this 4-day of April, 2025at_ /fi22 A.M., ERT.\n\nBY THE COURT:\n\nJames K. Bredar\nUnited States District Judge\n\n",

The Court determined that Defendants undertook reductions in force (RIFs) without\n\nfollowing procedures required by law, causing irreparable harm to the Plaintiff States, and that\n\ninjunctive relief was warranted to forestall harm to the Plaintiff States while this litigation\n\nproceeds. As the Court observed in granting a temporary restraining order (TRO), \u201c[i]t is generally\n\nlogically inconsistent for a court to issue a TRO or preliminary injunction and then stay that order,\n\nas the findings on which those decisions are premised are almost perfect opposites.\u201d ECF 43 at\n\n53. Defendants\u2019 stay motion rehashes the same arguments they made in opposing Plaintiffs\u2019\n\nmotion for a preliminary injunction. For the same reasons Plaintiffs previously articulated, see\n\nECF 78-1, these arguments fail. The Court rightly rejected them only days ago on the same record\n\nbefore the Court now. See ECF 125. Defendants have not carried their burden of showing that a\n\ndiscretionary stay is warranted.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    1\n\f        Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 133        Filed 04/04/25      Page 2 of 8\n\n\n\n                                          ARGUMENT\n\n        A stay pending appeal is \u201can exercise of judicial discretion,\u201d and not a \u201cmatter of right.\u201d\n\nNken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 433 (2009) (quoting Virginia R. Co. v. United States, 272 U.S. 658,\n\n672 (1926)). Indeed, \u201ca stay is considered \u2018extraordinary relief\u2019 for which the moving party bears\n\na \u2018heavy burden.\u2019\u201d Common Cause v. Rucho, 284 F. Supp. 3d 780, 783 (M.D.N.C. 2018). A party\n\nseeking a stay must demonstrate (1) \u201ca strong showing that [it] is likely to succeed on the merits,\u201d\n\n(2) irreparable injury absent a stay; (3) that issuance of a stay will not substantially injure other\n\nparties interested in the proceedings, and (4) that the public interest favors a stay. Nken, 556 U.S.\n\nat 433-35 (quoting Hilton v. Braunskill, 481 U.S. 770, 776 (1987)). The first two factors are most\n\nimportant, and it is not enough to show a \u201cbetter than negligible\u201d chance of success on the merits\n\nor a mere \u201cpossibility of irreparable injury.\u201d Id. at 434. Defendants fail each prong, and their\n\nmotion should be denied.\n\n   I.      Defendants Are Not Likely to Succeed on the Merits.\n\n        In granting the preliminary injunction motion, the Court found that the Plaintiffs States are\n\nlikely to succeed on the merits. ECF 125 at 39-64. Defendants advance no new justiciability or\n\nmerits arguments and offer no new evidence that might undercut the Court\u2019s conclusion.\n\n        Defendants have not established that the Court erred in concluding that \u201cthere is no\n\njusticiability defect that would divest it of jurisdiction over this action.\u201d ECF 125 at 10. With\n\nrespect to standing, the Court reviewed in detail the record evidence establishing that Plaintiffs\n\nhave suffered informational injuries and follow-on downstream harms stemming from the\n\ninformational deficit. ECF 125 at 12-27. The Court also explained that Plaintiffs\u2019 injuries are\n\ntraceable to Defendants and that Plaintiffs\u2019 injuries would be redressed by an order of the Court\n\nbarring Defendants from conducting unlawful RIFs and restoring unlawfully terminated\n\n\n\n\n                                                 2\n\f         Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB            Document 133    Filed 04/04/25     Page 3 of 8\n\n\n\nemployees to their positions. ECF 125 at 27-29. With respect to Defendants\u2019 contention that\n\nCongress divested the Court of jurisdiction over Plaintiffs\u2019 claims, the Court applied the\n\nframework set out in Thunder Basin Coal Co. v. Reich, 510 U.S. 200 (1994), and correctly rejected\n\nthose arguments. ECF 125 at 33-39.\n\n         Defendants likewise recycle their merits argument that their mass terminations of more\n\nthan 24,000 probationary employees over the course of a few weeks without individualized\n\nconsideration were not RIFs. The Court considered and rejected this argument too, explaining that\n\neven Defendants\u2019 own briefing indicates that the terminations were RIFs. ECF 125 at 42-52.\n\nDefendants offer no reason why the Court should reverse these findings now.\n\n         The closest Defendants come to a new argument is their contention that a stay would be\n\nwarranted if the issues before the Court present \u201can admittedly difficult legal question.\u201d ECF 131-\n\n1 at 3. But Defendants fail to square that standard with the requirement that they must also show\n\na \u201cstrong\u201d likelihood of success on the merits. Nken, 556 U.S. at 434. In any event, Defendants\n\nhave not raised any \u201cadmittedly difficult legal questions,\u201d let alone one that the Court did not\n\nresolve decisively in Plaintiffs\u2019 favor.\n\n         Because Defendants\u2019 arguments are duplicative of those raised in the preliminary\n\ninjunction briefing and that the Court has already rejected, Defendants have failed to make a\n\n\u201cstrong showing\u201d that they are likely to prevail. Nken, 556 U.S. at 434.\n\n   II.      Defendants Have Not Shown That Equitable Factors Favor a Stay.\n\n         Similarly, Defendants have not shown an entitlement to relief under the remaining three\n\nstay factors. Defendants insist that the Court has \u201cinterfere[d] in the Federal government\u2019s\n\nrelationship with its workforce\u201d and that the preliminary remedy is overly burdensome. But\n\nDefendants ignore that, as the Court explained, \u201cthe Government cannot engage in far-reaching\n\n\n\n\n                                                  3\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB              Document 133    Filed 04/04/25      Page 4 of 8\n\n\n\nillegal activity and then complain that the remedy is too burdensome.\u201d ECF 125 at 68. Further,\n\naccording to their March 17 status report, most Defendants have already rescinded the terminations\n\nof a majority of their probationary employees pursuant to the TRO. ECF No. 52. The preliminary\n\ninjunction merely requires those Defendants to continue maintaining these established\n\nemployment relationships during the pendency of the litigation, and with only a narrower subset\n\nof probationary employees at that. Defendants\u2019 claimed injuries related to the preliminary\n\ninjunction are thus minimal. See League of Women Voters of N.C. v. North Carolina, 769 F.3d 224,\n\n248 (4th Cir. 2014) (finding burden on government to restore status quo was lessened because\n\nrelevant \u201csystems have existed, do exist, and simply need to be resurrected,\u201d and other measures\n\n\u201cmerely require[] the revival of previous practices\u201d). Defendants likewise ignore the Court\u2019s\n\nexplanation that, \u201cin the absence of injunctive relief, the Government\u2019s desired quick reduction in\n\ncosts will inevitably correspond to a surge in costs borne by the Plaintiff States in responding to\n\nthe unnoticed mass terminations.\u201d ECF 125 at 68. As a result, Defendants fail to show that the\n\nequitable factors, including irreparable harm to Defendants, injury to other interested parties, and\n\nthe public interest warrant a stay here.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  4\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 133    Filed 04/04/25    Page 5 of 8\n\n\n\nApril 4, 2025                                Respectfully submitted,\n\n\n\n ANTHONY G.
