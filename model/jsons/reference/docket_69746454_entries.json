President Trump and his Administration have made no secret of their contempt for the\n\nroughly 2 million committed professionals who form the federal civil service. Nor have they\n\ndisguised their plans to terminate vast numbers of civil servants, starting with tens of thousands of\n\nprobationary employees. These large-scale, indiscriminate firings are not only subjecting the\n\nPlaintiff States and communities across the country to chaos. They are also against the law.\n\n2.     Federal statutes and regulations set forth procedures that federal agencies must follow\n\nwhen conducting reductions in force (\u201cRIFs\u201d). Critically, these procedures require that federal\n\nagencies provide 60 days of advance notice to affected employees and to states, so that they have\n\nan opportunity to mitigate the harms of layoffs. Where an agency fails to provide such notice, the\n\nemployees \u201cmay not be released.\u201d\n\n3.     Over the past month, the new Administration has run roughshod over the RIF requirements.\n\nSpecifically, as part of an effort to reduce the size of the federal workforce, the Office of Personnel\n\nManagement (\u201cOPM\u201d) has unlawfully directed federal agencies to conduct mass terminations of\n\nprobationary employees, suddenly and without any advance notice. Defendants have followed\n\nthrough on this directive, firing employees by the hundreds and, in many instances, thousands\u2014\n\nall without following the procedures for conducting RIFs and without providing notice to the\n\naffected employees or states.\n\n4.     This campaign has inflicted immense harms on tens of thousands of probationary\n\nemployees and their families. It has rendered them jobless without providing any advance notice\n\n\n\n                                                  8\n                                               JA29\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA           Document 1        Filed 03/06/25       Page 9 of 55\n\n\n\nthat might have given them an opportunity to seek other employment or even budget to prepare\n\nfor the loss of income. As a result, many affected employees and their families are struggling to\n\nmake ends meet\u2014to pay rent, buy groceries, and care for their loved ones.\n\n5.     This campaign is harming Plaintiff States, too. In addition to the informational and\n\nprocedural injuries resulting from the deprivation of notice to which they were entitled, the lack of\n\nnotice has impeded the ability of many Plaintiff States to support affected employees and thereby\n\nmitigate the financial and other impacts on state services. In fact, pursuant to federal statutory\n\nrequirements, Plaintiff States operate rapid response teams that provide immediate services and\n\nresources to workers subject to mass layoffs. These services include job placement and job training\n\nservices as well as connections to social services like unemployment insurance and health\n\ninsurance. Because of Defendants\u2019 failure to adhere to the RIF notice procedures, many Plaintiff\n\nStates have had to scramble and expend additional resources to identify even which agencies have\n\nconducted layoffs and which affected employees require support.\n\n6.     Because of the lack of notice, many Plaintiff States have also faced increased\n\nadministrative demands related to adjudicating unemployment claims; decreased tax revenues; and\n\nincreased demands for social services. Some Plaintiff States have also lost the benefit of services\n\nprovided by federal employees embedded within state agencies, without any time to prepare.\n\n7.     To address these harms to Plaintiff States, this action seeks declaratory and injunctive relief\n\nrequiring Defendants: to cease the RIFs of probationary employees that they have conducted\n\nunlawfully and without notice; to reinstate any probationary employees who were terminated as\n\npart of mass terminations on or after January 20, 2025; to refrain from separating any employees\n\npursuant to a RIF prior to reinstatement of the unlawfully terminated probationary employees; and\n\n\n\n\n                                                 9\n                                              JA30\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA             Document 1      Filed 03/06/25      Page 10 of 55\n\n\n\nto conduct any future RIFs in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, including providing\n\nrequired notices to Plaintiff States.\n\n                              I.

Federal workers reside and work in each of the Plaintiff States. The Defendants have\n\nconducted\u2014or have announced plans to imminently conduct\u2014illegal RIFs by firing probationary\n\nemployees in Plaintiff States without adhering to the statutory and regulatory requirements for\n\nconducting RIFs.\n\n                                III.    LEGAL FRAMEWORK\n\nA.     Probationary Employees\n\n75.    OPM\u2019s directive to agencies to terminate probationary employees en masse has swept up\n\ntwo categories of federal employees whose employment is governed by statute and regulation:\n\nprobationary employees in the \u201ccompetitive\u201d service, and employees within their first two years\n\nof employment in the \u201cexcepted\u201d service. Competitive service employees are hired through an\n\nopen, competitive hiring process and excepted service employees are appointed through a non-\n\ncompetitive hiring process. Plaintiff States refer herein to all such employees as \u201cprobationary\n\nemployees.\u201d\n\n76.    Probationary employees in the competitive service are, with some exceptions, those who\n\nhave been employed for less than one year. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7511(a)(1)(A)(ii); 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.801.\n\n77.    Employees are appointed as \u201ccareer\u201d or \u201ccareer-conditional employees\u201d subject to\n\ncompleting the probationary period. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.201(a).\n\n78.    The probationary period provides the opportunity for the federal agency to assess the\n\nindividual performance of the employee. Under governing OPM regulations, an agency \u201cshall\n\nutilize the probationary period as fully as possible to determine the fitness of the employee and\n\n\n\n\n                                                 19\n                                              JA40\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA           Document 1       Filed 03/06/25      Page 20 of 55\n\n\n\nshall terminate his or her services during this period if the employee fails to demonstrate fully his\n\nor her qualifications for continued employment.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.803(a).\n\n79.    Most employees in the excepted service are also subject to a statutory trial period of two\n\nyears, which, like the probationary period in the competitive service, is intended to permit the\n\nagency to evaluate the employee\u2019s performance and fitness for long-term employment. 5 U.S.C.\n\n\u00a7 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii).\n\n80.    Outside of the context of a RIF, federal agencies may lawfully terminate probationary\n\nemployees for one of two reasons.\n\n81.    First, a federal agency may lawfully terminate a probationary employee for reasons based\n\non conditions arising before the employee\u2019s probationary appointment. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.805.\n\n82.    Second, a federal agency may lawfully terminate a probationary employee based on the\n\nagency\u2019s assessment of the employee\u2019s performance during the probationary period, pursuant to 5\n\nC.F.R. \u00a7 315.804(a), which is entitled: \u201cTermination of probationers for unsatisfactory\n\nperformance or conduct.\u201d\n\n83.    Under that regulation, \u201cwhen an agency decides to terminate an employee serving a\n\nprobationary or trial period because his work performance or conduct during this period fails to\n\ndemonstrate his fitness or his qualifications for continued employment, it shall terminate his\n\nservices by notifying him in writing as to why he is being separated and the effective date of the\n\naction.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.804(a). \u201cThe information in the notice as to why the employee is being\n\nterminated shall, as a minimum, consist of the agency\u2019s conclusions as to the inadequacies of his\n\nperformance or conduct.\u201d Id. Trial-period employees in the excepted service have the same notice\n\nrights when removed from their positions for performance reasons. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 316.304.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 20\n                                              JA41\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA          Document 1       Filed 03/06/25      Page 21 of 55\n\n\n\nB.     RIF Requirements\n\n84.    Apart from terminations of probationary employees for conditions arising before their\n\nappointments or for unsatisfactory performance or conduct, federal agencies may only terminate\n\nprobationary employees as part of an agency RIF.\n\n85.    A reduction-in-force \u201cis an administrative procedure by which agencies eliminate jobs and\n\nreassign or separate employees who occupied the abolished positions. A RIF is not an adverse\n\naction against a particular employee, but is directed solely at a position within an agency.\u201d James\n\nv. Von Zemenszky, 284 F.3d 1310, 1314 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (citation omitted); Schall v. U.S. Postal\n\nServ., 73 F.3d 341, 344 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (similar).\n\n86.    An agency must follow specific statutory directives in conducting a RIF, including\n\nfollowing the retention preferences in the statute, giving preference to the retention of military\n\nveterans, and considering the employee\u2019s tenure and length of service. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(a)(1), (3).\n\n87.    Congress delegated to OPM the authority to promulgate regulations that agencies must\n\nfollow in implementing RIFs. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(a).\n\n88.    Pursuant to that statutory authorization, and through notice-and-comment rulemaking,\n\nOPM has issued detailed regulations setting forth the procedures by which agencies must conduct\n\nRIFs. See 5 C.F.R. Part 351.\n\n89.    All agencies of the federal government are required to comply with the RIF regulations\n\nwhenever they \u201cdetermine[] that a reduction [in] force is necessary.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.204.\n\n90.    The RIF regulations apply to employees in the competitive and excepted services. 5 C.F.R.\n\n\u00a7 351.202(a), (b).\n\n91.    Probationary employees are expressly covered by the RIF regulations. 5 C.F.R.\n\n\u00a7\u00a7 351.501(b)(2), 351.502(b)(2). Probationary employees are included in \u201cgroup II\u201d of three\n\ngroups of employees, and may only be released, in order of retention, after the release of\n\n\n                                                21\n                                             JA42\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA          Document 1        Filed 03/06/25      Page 22 of 55\n\n\n\n\u201cgroup III\u201d employees, a group that includes employees under various temporary, term, and other\n\nprovisional appointments. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.501(b).\n\n92.    Under these required RIF procedures, before conducting a RIF a federal agency must:\n\nestablish \u201ccompetitive areas in which employees compete for retention\u201d; designate the\n\n\u201ccompetitive areas\u201d of which employees are to compete for retention at least 90 days before the\n\neffective date of the RIF; designate any \u201ccompetitive levels\u201d of positions included in the RIFs that\n\nwould permit the agency to reassign retained employees without causing undue interruption; and\n\nrank employees for retention based on factors including their tenure group, time in service\n\n(including military service), veteran preference, length of service, and performance. See 5 U.S.C.\n\n\u00a7 3502(a); 5 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 351.402-351.404, 351.504.\n\nC.     RIF Notice Requirements\n\n93.    Under the federal RIF statute and associated regulations, federal agencies are required to\n\nprovide at least 60 days of prior written notice before they may release any federal civil service\n\nemployee under a RIF. The agency must provide the written notice to (a) the employee, (b) the\n\nemployee\u2019s collective bargaining representative, and (c) the state or District where an affected\n\nemployee\u2019s duty station was located if the RIF would involve at least 50 employees within the\n\ncompetitive area, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d); 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.803(b).\n\n94.    The notice to the state must be provided to the state or agency designated by the state to\n\nperform rapid response activities under the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, now called the\n\nWorkforce Innovation and Opportunity Act of 2014 (\u201cWIOA Agency\u201d), and must also be provided\n\nto \u201c[t]he chief elected official of local government(s) within which these separations will occur.\u201d\n\n5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.803(b); see 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d)(3)(A). The purpose of states\u2019 \u201crapid response\u201d\n\nactivities is to quickly make public and private resources available to workers who are laid off, to\n\nminimize the disruption to the affected workers and their communities. To help the state or locality\n\n\n                                                22\n                                              JA43\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA          Document 1       Filed 03/06/25      Page 23 of 55\n\n\n\nprepare for the disruptions associated with job losses, notices must include: (a) the number of\n\nemployees to be separated from service due to the reduction in force, broken down by geographic\n\narea and organizational unit, (b) when those separations will occur; and (c) other information that\n\nmay facilitate the delivery of services to the affected workers. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d); 5 C.F.R.\n\n\u00a7 351.803(c).\n\n95.    The notice to an affected employee must include: (a) information concerning the right to\n\nreemployment consideration and career transition assistance; (b) a release to authorize the federal\n\ngovernment to share his or her resume and employment information with the WIOA Agency and\n\npotential public or private sector employers; and (c) information about how to apply for\n\nunemployment insurance and access other benefits. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.803(a).\n\n96.    Where circumstances \u201cnot reasonably foreseeable\u201d preclude giving 60 days\u2019 written notice,\n\nthe agency may request that OPM shorten the notice period; however, \u201c[n]o notice period may be\n\nshortened to less than 30 days.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(e).\n\n97.    Where an agency fails to provide any of these statutorily required notices, an employee\n\n\u201cmay not be released, due to a reduction in force.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d).\n\n                             IV.     FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS\n\n98.    Since President Trump took office on January 20, 2025, Defendant Agencies have, at\n\nOPM\u2019s direction, terminated tens of thousands of probationary employees.\n\n99.    The mass terminations of probationary employees since January 20 were not driven by\n\nagency determinations related to the performance or qualifications of any particular probationary\n\nemployee. Rather, these layoffs have all been part of a coordinated effort directed by the White\n\nHouse and OPM to reduce the size of the federal workforce.\n\n\n\n\n                                                23\n                                             JA44\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA            Document 1         Filed 03/06/25      Page 24 of 55\n\n\n\n100.    Because the mass terminations of probationary employees are part of an effort to\n\nrestructure and reduce the workforces at Defendant Agencies, they constitute RIFs. See 5 U.S.C.\n\n\u00a7 3502; 5 C.F.R. Part 351.\n\n101.    In terminating probationary employees en masse, Defendants have not abided by the\n\nstatutory and regulatory requirements for RIFs, including the requirement to provide 60 days\u2019\n\nnotice to the Plaintiff States. This has inflicted and will continue to inflict serious and irreparable\n\nharms on the Plaintiff States, as they must now deal with a sudden surge in unemployment, without\n\nthe advance notice required under the federal RIF statute and regulations.\n\nA.      Defendants Have Conducted Unlawful RIFs Throughout the Federal Government.\n\n102.    On January 20, 2025, the day President Trump took office, President Trump appointed\n\nCharles Ezell to serve as Acting OPM Director.\n\n103.    The same day, Acting OPM Director Ezell distributed a memo to \u201cHeads and Acting Heads\n\nof Departments and Agencies\u201d regarding \u201cGuidance on Probationary Periods, Administrative\n\nLeave and Details.\u201d In the memo, OPM directed agency heads to \u201cidentify all employees on\n\nprobationary periods . . . and send a report to OPM listing all such employees\u201d no later than January\n\n24, 2025. OPM further directed agencies to \u201cpromptly determine whether those employees should\n\nbe retained by the agency.\u201d1\n\n104.    Also on January 20, 2025, President Trump signed an executive order entitled \u201cHiring\n\nFreeze.\u201d2 In addition to ordering \u201ca freeze on the hiring of federal civilian employees\u201d throughout\n\nthe executive branch, he directed the Director of the Office of Management and Budget\u2014in\n\nconsultation with OPM and the United States Department of Government Efficiency Service\n\n\n\n1\n  https://chcoc.gov/sites/default/files/Guidance%20on%20Probationary%20Periods%2C%20Administrative%20Leav\ne%20and%20Details%XXX-XX-XXXX%20FINAL.pdf\n2\n  https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/hiring-freeze/\n\n\n                                                   24\n                                                JA45\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA              Document 1         Filed 03/06/25       Page 25 of 55\n\n\n\n(\u201cDOGE\u201d)\u2014to \u201csubmit a plan to reduce the size of the Federal Government\u2019s workforce through\n\nefficiency improvements and attrition.\u201d\n\n105.     On February 11, 2025, President Trump issued Executive Order 14210, entitled\n\n\u201cImplementing the President\u2019s \u2018Department of Government Efficiency\u2019 Workforce Optimization\n\nInitiative.\u201d The Executive Order directed agency heads to \u201cpromptly undertake preparations to\n\ninitiate large-scale reductions in force (RIFs), consistent with applicable law, and to separate from\n\nFederal service temporary employees and reemployed annuitants working in areas that will likely\n\nbe subject to the RIFs.\u201d3\n\n106.    Rather than wait for agency heads to develop RIF plans and follow applicable procedures,\n\nhowever, Defendants began mass unlawful terminations of their probationary employees.\n\n107.    On or around February 11, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau terminated\n\napproximately 73 probationary employees. 4 The agency terminated 70-100 additional\n\nprobationary employees on February 13. 5\n\n108.    On or around February 12, the Department of Education terminated 60 probationary\n\nemployees.6\n\n109.    On or around February 12, the General Services Administration notified approximately\n\n100 probationary employees that they would be terminated.7 Upon information and belief, these\n\nterminations will become effective on March 7.\n\n\n\n\n3\n  https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/implementing-the-presidents-department-of-\ngovernment-efficiency-workforce-optimization-initiative/\n4\n  https://www.npr.org/2025/02/12/nx-s1-5294479/cfpb-workers-fired-trump-doge\n5\n  https://www.npr.org/2025/02/14/nx-s1-5298144/federal-layoffs-usda-hud-defense-trump\n6\n  https://www.npr.org/2025/02/13/nx-s1-5296928/layoffs-trump-doge-education-energy\n7\n  https://www.reuters.com/world/us/mass-firings-federal-workers-begin-trump-musk-purge-us-government-2025-\n02-13/\n\n\n                                                     25\n                                                  JA46\n\f        Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA              Document 1          Filed 03/06/25        Page 26 of 55\n\n\n\n110.    On February 13, OPM officials met with agency officials throughout the federal\n\ngovernment and ordered agencies to lay off nearly all of the federal government\u2019s approximately\n\n220,0000 probationary employees.8\n\n111.    On February 14, OPM sent an email to all agency Chief Human Capital Officers (CHCOs)\n\nand their deputies to \u201cclarif[y] immediate next steps for probationary employees.\u201d\n\n112.    In its February 14 email, OPM explained its directive to agencies:\n\n        We have asked that you separate probationary employees that you have not\n        identified as mission critical no later than the end of the day Monday, 2/27. We\n        have attached a template letter. The separation date should be as soon as possible\n        that is consistent with applicable agency policies (including those in CBAs).\n\n113.    OPM\u2019s February 14 email reiterated that OPM\u2019s directive should be followed in light of\n\nthe \u201cPresident\u2019s directive to dramatically reduce the size of the federal workforce.\u201d\n\n114.    OPM\u2019s directive at the February 13 meeting and in the February 14 email coincided with\n\na rapid uptick in terminations of probationary employees.\n\n115.    On or around February 13, the Department of Energy terminated nearly 2,000 probationary\n\nemployees.9 Days later, the agency rescinded approximately 350 termination notices to\n\nprobationary employees in the National Nuclear Security Administration, which oversees the\n\nnation\u2019s nuclear stockpile.10\n\n116.    On or around February 13, the Department of Veterans Affairs terminated more than 1,000\n\nprobationary employees.11 The Department of Veterans Affairs fired another 1,400 probationary\n\nemployees on February 24.12\n\n\n\n\n8\n  https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5144113-federal-probationary-employees-fired/\n9\n  https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/13/trump-federal-worker-layoffs-00204180\n10\n   https://www.cbsnews.com/news/doge-firings-us-nuclear-weapons-workers-reversing/\n11\n   https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5162213-va-axes-another-1400-employees/\n12\n   Id.\n\n\n                                                      26\n                                                   JA47\n\f        Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA              Document 1          Filed 03/06/25        Page 27 of 55\n\n\n\n117.    On or around February 13, OPM fired 250 probationary employees. 13\n\n118.    On or around February 13, the Small Business Administration terminated around 720\n\nprobationary employees.14\n\n119.    On or around February 13, the Department of Agriculture terminated approximately 3,400\n\nprobationary employees in the Forest Service. 15\n\n120.    On or around February 13, the Department of Energy terminated around 130 probationary\n\nemployees in the Bonneville Power Administration.16 Several days later, the Department of Energy\n\ndeemed around 30 of those probationary employees as critical and rescinded the terminations.\n\n121.    On or around February 14, the Environmental Protection Agency fired approximately 388\n\nprobationary employees.\n\n122.    On or around February 14, the Interior Department fired approximately 2,400 probationary\n\nemployees, including 800 people from the Bureau of Land Management. 17\n\n123.

On or around February 14, the Department of Health and Human Services terminated\n\naround 1,300 probationary employees working for the Centers for Disease Control (\u201cCDC\u201d) and\n\nPrevention.19 Upon information and belief, the Department of Health and Human Services has also\n\nterminated probationary employees at the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug\n\nAdministration, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\n125.    Upon information and belief, on or around February 14, the Department of Housing and\n\nUrban Development terminated more than 50 probationary employees.\n\n126.    On or around February 15, the Department of Interior fired around 1,000 probationary\n\nemployees in the National Park Service.20\n\n127.    On or around February 15, the Department of Agriculture fired around 2,000 probationary\n\nemployees.21 Several days later, the department rehired several employees who were involved in\n\nthe government\u2019s response to the ongoing bird flu outbreak.\n\n128.

On or around March 3, the Department of Commerce fired 73 probationary employees at\n\nthe National Institute for Standards and Technology.29\n\n138.    Upon information and belief, Defendants have already terminated tens of thousands of\n\nprobationary employees.\n\n139.    Defendants have not published official counts and locations of the employees they have\n\nterminated, but based on publicly reported numbers and firsthand accounts from affected\n\nemployees, it appears that Defendants have terminated at least 24,000 probationary employees as\n\nof the date of this Complaint. Because Plaintiff States have not received notice of these mass\n\nterminations, this accounting is necessarily incomplete and may be far higher.\n\n140.    Thousands of additional terminations are expected any day. To continue to reduce the size\n\nof the federal workforce, agencies that have not yet terminated most of their probationary\n\nemployees may do so at any moment.\n\nB.      Defendants Have Not Followed Required RIF Procedures for the Mass Layoffs of\n        Probationary Employees\n\n141.    Although the mass terminations of probationary employees have constituted RIFs,\n\nDefendants have failed to follow the RIF procedures required by statute and regulation.\n\n142.    For example, Defendants did not designate the \u201ccompetitive areas\u201d in which employees\n\nwould compete for retention, which they must do at least 90 days before the effective date of any\n\nRIF. See 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.402.\n\n143.    Defendants did not designate any \u201ccompetitive levels\u201d of positions included in the RIFs\n\nthat would permit the agency to reassign retained employees without causing undue interruption.\n\nSee 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.403.\n\n\n\n29\n  https://www.govexec.com/workforce/2025/03/some-agencies-are-still-firing-probationers-while-others-have-\nrecalled-theirs-following-court-ruling/403407/?oref=ge-skybox-post\n\n\n                                                      30\n                                                   JA51\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA            Document 1       Filed 03/06/25       Page 31 of 55\n\n\n\n144.   Defendants did not establish a retention register of employees in each competitive level of\n\npositions included in the RIFs. See 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.404.\n\n145.   Defendants did not then rank employees for retention based on their tenure group, time in\n\nservice (including military service), veteran preference, length of service, and performance. See 5\n\nU.S.C. \u00a7 3502(a); 5 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 351.501-351.504.\n\n146.   Defendants did not provide required notices 60 days in advance of the effective date of\n\ntermination to affected employees, their collective bargaining representatives, or to Plaintiff States.\n\nSee 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d); 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.803.\n\n147.   Especially relevant to Plaintiff States, Defendants did not provide affected employees with\n\nthe required releases to authorize the release of their resumes and other relevant employment\n\ninformation to the relevant WIOA Agency, for employment referrals to potential public and private\n\nsector employers. See 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.803(a).\n\n148.   Likewise, Defendants did not provide Plaintiff States and the relevant WIOA Agencies\n\nwith any prior notice, much less the 60-day notice required by law, which would have alerted\n\nPlaintiff States to the number of employees to be separated from the agencies, broken down by\n\ngeographic area, and provided the effective date of the planned separations as well as other\n\ninformation that could have facilitated the delivery of rapid response services. See 5 U.S.C.\n\n\u00a7 3502(d); 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.803(b)-(c).\n\n149.   Rather than comply with their legal obligations, Defendants summarily terminated\n\nprobationary employees en masse, providing termination notices to the affected employees by\n\nform letters and emails, which frequently included errors and in many instances failed to include\n\neven the employee\u2019s name or job title.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  31\n                                               JA52\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA           Document 1       Filed 03/06/25      Page 32 of 55\n\n\n\n150.   These form termination notices, issued near-simultaneously to thousands of federal\n\nprobationary employees, failed to include any particularized agency determinations related to the\n\nperformance or qualifications of each affected probationary employee to justify their termination.\n\nThe notices were pretextual because Defendants were actually engaged in RIFs designed to reduce\n\nthe size of the federal workforce.\n\n151.   For example, agency management at the National Science Foundation informed\n\nprobationary employees that the NSF had previously chosen to retain its probationary employees\n\nbut that OPM had directed NSF to terminate the employees. The managers said that terminating\n\nthe probationary employees was not a decision the agency made,\u201d but was \u201ca direction [it had]\n\nreceived\u201d from OPM and that NSF leadership had \u201cno choice\u201d but to \u201cfollow[] orders.\u201d\n\n152.   Likewise, in response to OPM\u2019s directive to terminate probationary employees en masse,\n\nthe Department of Treasury directed the Internal Revenue Service to terminate all probationary\n\nemployees \u201cbased on performance.\u201d Without conducting any review of probationary employees\u2019\n\nqualifications or performance, the Department of Treasury directed the IRS to terminate\n\napproximately 6,700 probationary employees. These terminations were unrelated to the\n\nprobationary employees\u2019 qualifications, performance, or conduct, but were in fact a RIF aimed at\n\nreducing the size of the agency\u2019s workforce.\n\n153.   The same pattern occurred at the Center for Consumer Information and Insurance\n\nOversight (CCIIO), a subset of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) within the\n\nDepartment of Health and Human Services (HHS). CCIIO had determined that none of its\n\nprobationary employees should be removed from service because all were well qualified for their\n\npositions and were performing well. Nevertheless, on February 13, 2025, HHS directed CCIIO to\n\nterminate all of its probationary employees and to issue form termination letters that stated falsely\n\n\n\n\n                                                 32\n                                               JA53\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA            Document 1         Filed 03/06/25   Page 33 of 55\n\n\n\nthat the affected employees were being terminated \u201cbecause [their] ability, knowledge, and skills\n\ndo not fit the Agency\u2019s current needs, and [their] performance has not been adequate to justify\n\nfurther employment.\u201d The CCIIO terminated 82 probationary employees on February 15, 2025,\n\nrepresenting approximately 15% of its workforce of approximately 600.\n\n154.    Defendants\u2019 failure to provide required RIF notices rendered any terminations ineffective\n\nand unlawful because an employee \u201cmay not be released, due to a reduction in force\u201d unless an\n\nagency provides all statutorily required notices. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d).\n\n155.    As explained in further detail below in Section IV.C, Defendants\u2019 failure to provide these\n\nrequired notices has harmed Plaintiff States in several ways, including by hindering the ability to\n\nprovide rapid response services.\n\nC.      Plaintiffs Are Harmed As a Direct Result of Defendants\u2019 Failure to Follow RIF\n        Requirements and Provide Advance Notice to the States.\n\n156.    Plaintiff States have suffered and will imminently suffer several types of irreparable injury\n\ndue to the federal government\u2019s failure to provide notice of the RIFs.\n\n157.    As noted above, when a federal agency plans to release 50 or more employees in a RIF,\n\nthe agency must provide 60 days\u2019 notice to the affected States\u2019 WIOA Agencies as well as the\n\nchief elected officials for affected local jurisdictions.\n\n158.    Plaintiff States have not received notice of a federal reduction in force from any federal\n\nagency.\n\n159.    In enacting the RIF notice requirements, Congress recognized the harms inherent to\n\nsudden, unexpected mass layoffs, including that economic dislocation of workers can easily create\n\na cascade of instability throughout a regional economy. And it sought to provide the states with\n\nsome protection against those harms by requiring that agencies provide them with advance notice.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   33\n                                                JA54\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA           Document 1        Filed 03/06/25      Page 34 of 55\n\n\n\n160.    Defendants\u2019 failure to provide notice has inflicted other harms as well. As a result of the\n\nlack of notice, Plaintiff States are unable to proactively reach affected individuals and provide\n\nservices that would mitigate the harm the employees and their communities suffer as a result of\n\nthe sudden job loss.\n\n161.    Plaintiff States also suffer procedural injury resulting in additional expenditures and harms\n\nto public finances that they would not have to bear if notice had been provided.\n\n                                  Rapid Response Expenditures\n\n162.    The Federal Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act of 2014, 29 U.S.C.\n\n\u00a7 3174(A)(2)(i), requires that each state have a rapid response program to conduct outreach to\n\nworkers affected by a mass layoff and to provide the workers with support services, including job\n\ntransition services.\n\n163.    The notice required by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d)(3)(A) is intended to trigger rapid response\n\nactivities since it is explicitly to be given to the state entity required to carry out rapid response\n\nactivities.\n\n164.    The purpose of the rapid response system is to reduce individuals\u2019 reliance on public\n\nbenefit systems, such as unemployment insurance; to promote economic recovery and vitality by\n\ndeveloping an ongoing, comprehensive approach to identify, plan for, and respond to layoffs and\n\ndislocations; and to prevent or minimize the impact of mass layoffs on workers, businesses, and\n\ncommunities.\n\n165.    When notified of a forthcoming mass layoff, a state\u2019s rapid response team is required to:\n\ncontact the employer, representatives of the affected workers, and the local community; assess the\n\nlayoff plans and schedule; and provide information and support to affected employees, including\n\n\n\n\n                                                 34\n                                               JA55\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA           Document 1       Filed 03/06/25     Page 35 of 55\n\n\n\ninformation about filing for unemployment compensation and career services. 20 CFR \u00a7\u00a7\n\n682.300, 682.330.\n\n166.   The rapid response teams also facilitate connections to partner agencies and organizations\n\nthat can provide terminated workers and their families with critical services, such as home heating\n\nassistance, legal aid, and financial advice.\n\n167.   Because Plaintiff States\u2019 rapid response teams have received no notice of federal RIFs,\n\ncertain teams have been required to dedicate significantly more staff, resources, and expenditures\n\nto fulfill their statutory mission. In particular, they have had to devote significant time and\n\nresources simply to try to identify workers subject to federal mass layoffs and to otherwise make\n\nresources available to potentially affected individuals in new ways, all because federal agencies\n\nhave failed to provide the legally required notice of mass layoffs.\n\n168.   As one example of these efforts, some state agencies handling unemployment claims have\n\ncreated new websites, requiring significant time and expense. See Maryland Workers Impacted by\n\nRecent Federal Actions, https://response.maryland.gov/federalpublicservants/. These efforts were\n\na further attempt to provide rapid response resources and services, which could normally be\n\ntargeted at specific personnel before they are laid off, but must now be provided less efficiently\n\nand at greater expense to the entire public, because the states\u2019 personnel remain unaware of who\n\nhas been laid off and whether and when the next federal mass layoff event will occur.\n\n169.   As another example, because Maryland\u2019s Department of Labor did not receive advance\n\nnotice, staff have conducted extensive affirmative outreach to dozens of federal agencies and\n\noffices to try and determine the location and extent of upcoming layoffs. Despite these efforts,\n\nstaff have not received any substantive responses. The Department has also had to divert\n\nsignificant additional time of other agency personnel from state projects to instead respond to\n\n\n\n\n                                                35\n                                               JA56\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA          Document 1       Filed 03/06/25      Page 36 of 55\n\n\n\nfederal mass firings, to try and identify recently terminated employees and provide relevant\n\nresources and services.\n\n                             Unemployment Benefits Expenditures\n\n170.   As a general matter, the federal government is required to reimburse states for\n\nunemployment benefits provided to former federal employees. Specifically, Plaintiff States are\n\nparty to an agreement with the United States Secretary of Labor, wherein the Secretary shall pay,\n\nas an agent of the United States, Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees (\u201cUCFE\u201d)\n\npursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8502(a).\n\n171.   Each Plaintiff State has its own procedures for handling Unemployment Insurance (\u201cUI\u201d)\n\nclaims. Regardless, sudden mass layoffs burden the administrative process for handling UI claims,\n\nand the lack of notice and chaotic nature of Defendants\u2019 mass layoffs of probationary employees\n\nhas already exacerbated or likely will exacerbate the strain on the Plaintiff States\u2019 systems for\n\nadministering UI.\n\n172.   Maryland\u2019s experience exemplifies the problems with the unlawful way the Defendants\n\nhave conducted RIFs of probationary employees.\n\n173.   The Maryland Department of Labor manages claims for unemployment benefits by\n\nindividuals formerly employed to work in Maryland.\n\n174.   Pursuant to Md. Code Ann., Lab. & Empl. \u00a7 8-805(a), an individual in Maryland who\n\nwishes to collect unemployment insurance benefits must file a claim in accordance with\n\nregulations adopted by the Maryland Secretary of Labor. Claimants file claims online using the\n\nDepartment\u2019s system to assert a claim initially and to provide information to indicate the basis of\n\nthe claim, the name of the claimant\u2019s previous employer, the reason for her separation, work\n\nexperience, and other relevant information. COMAR 09.32.02.05.\n\n\n\n\n                                                36\n                                             JA57\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA          Document 1        Filed 03/06/25      Page 37 of 55\n\n\n\n175.   The reason for termination alleged by the claimant is then transmitted to the claimant\u2019s\n\nemployer(s) for verification. The employer is then asked to furnish a report of the separation from\n\nemployment containing, among other information, the reason for the employee\u2019s separation and a\n\nreport of wage history. Md. Code Ann. Lab. & Empl. \u00a7 8-627; see also COMAR 09.32.02.05.\n\n176.   Maryland law disqualifies some claimants from benefits depending on the circumstances\n\nof their separation from employment. See Md. Code Ann. Lab. & Empl. \u00a7 8-1001, et seq.\n\nDisqualifying circumstances include, among other reasons, termination for misconduct,\n\naggravated misconduct, and gross misconduct. Id. In addition, a claimant is disqualified if they\n\nquit their job without good cause directly related to employment conditions or employer actions.\n\nMd. Code Ann. Lab. & Empl. \u00a7 8-1001(a).\n\n177.   If a determination involves a resolution of a dispute of material fact, a claims examiner\n\nfrom the Maryland Department of Labor must conduct a predetermination fact-finding interview\n\nafter notice is provided to the employee and her employer(s). Md. Code. Ann. Lab & Empl. \u00a7 8-\n\n806(a)(2). Thereafter, a written initial determination must be made stating, among other things, the\n\nweekly benefit amount, maximum benefits payable to the claimant in a benefit year, and the\n\nreasons for the determination. Md. Code Ann. Lab. & Empl. \u00a7 8-806(c).\n\n178.   If the claims examiner\u2019s review of a claim reveals no dispute of material fact, but the\n\ninformation reviewed indicates that claimant may be ineligible or disqualified, the claims\n\nexaminers must still schedule a call for an appointment for a fact-finding interview and render a\n\nwritten decision. COMAR 09.32.16(D)-(E). A claimant or an employer may file an administrative\n\nappeal within 15 days. Md. Code Ann. Lab. & Empl. \u00a7 8-806(e)(1).\n\n179.   The Maryland Department of Labor\u2019s latest data indicates that 813 former federal\n\nemployees have applied for unemployment benefits since January 21, 2025.\n\n\n\n\n                                                37\n                                              JA58\n\f         Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA         Document 1       Filed 03/06/25     Page 38 of 55\n\n\n\n180.      As noted above, the number of UCFE claims received by the Maryland Department of\n\nLabor has increased significantly in just the last few weeks, starting on or around February 14,\n\n2025, with an approximate range of 30 to 60 new such claims every day.\n\n181.      In fact, the amount of UCFE claims received by the Maryland Department of Labor in\n\nFebruary 2025 is significantly higher than past years. From January 21 to March 3, 2024,\n\nMaryland received only 189 unemployment claims containing federal wages in the claimant\u2019s base\n\nperiod.\n\n182.      While not required to apply for unemployment benefits, multiple individuals have attached\n\nin their application their letter of employment termination from the federal government. Such\n\nletters indicate that these individuals were probationary employees purportedly terminated for\n\ncause.\n\n183.      When an employer provides the initial report of separation to the Maryland Department of\n\nLabor, the employer must indicate the reason for the separation, including whether the employee\n\nwas fired for cause, such as misconduct.\n\n184.      Accordingly, if an employer states in its report of separation that an individual was\n\nterminated because performance has not been adequate to justify further employment at the\n\nagency, the Maryland Department of Labor\u2019s procedures require that the claims examiner must\n\ninvestigate the reason for discharge.\n\n185.      The Maryland Department of Labor is also required to verify both wages and reason for\n\nseparation of employment from each federal agency by sending a request for wage and separation\n\ninformation. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 609.6(e)(1), 609.21 through 609.25. While private employers report\n\nwages each quarter for all employees into the Department\u2019s database, see COMAR 09.32.01.12,\n\nfederal agencies are not required to regularly report active employee wages to the States.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 38\n                                               JA59\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA          Document 1        Filed 03/06/25      Page 39 of 55\n\n\n\n186.   The same Department staff who handle regular unemployment claims also process and\n\nadjudicate UCFE claims. Redirecting staff from handling regular UI claims to process and\n\nadjudicate UCFE claims threatens to strain the state\u2019s resources.\n\n187.   This diversion of personnel will undoubtedly impede the timely processing of regular UI\n\nclaims, creating significant backlogs and delays. The consequences will be far-reaching, affecting\n\ncountless individuals who depend on swift resolutions to sustain their livelihoods. By diverting\n\nresources, the state must compromise the efficiency and responsiveness of its claims processing\n\nsystem, ultimately undermining public trust and exacerbating economic hardship.\n\n188.   While the Maryland Department of Labor is only beginning to process these claims, its\n\nstaff has already begun contacting relevant federal agencies to request information on relevant\n\nterminations, to determine if they were in fact done for cause\n\n189.   Thus far, Maryland has received at least 193 reports of separation from federal agencies,\n\nconcerning their recently terminated employees.\n\n190.   Several Defendant agencies reported that probationary employees were terminated due to\n\na \u201cpermanent lack of work due to a change in Presidential Administration.\u201d\n\n191.   In addition, the Maryland Department of Labor received several reports from Defendant\n\nagencies explicitly stating that the employees were \u201claid off due to a reduction in force.\u201d\n\n192.   And, as relevant here, certain reports by Defendants asserted that the employee at issue\n\nwas terminated for cause, for instance due to \u201cunsatisfactory work performance\u201d and similar\n\ngeneric performance-related bases.\n\n193.   Similarly, other reports highlighted various potentially disqualifying circumstances. For\n\ninstance, agencies indicated that claimants might not be genuinely unemployed or had voluntarily\n\nresigned from their positions.\n\n\n\n\n                                                39\n                                              JA60\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA          Document 1        Filed 03/06/25    Page 40 of 55\n\n\n\n194.   Due Defendants\u2019 assertions that certain federal employees were terminated for cause or\n\notherwise ineligible or disqualified from benefits, or where there is disputed or conflicting\n\ninformation, Maryland will be required to follow our intensive and mandatory investigative\n\nprocess.\n\n195.   The procedures impose a significant strain on the Maryland Department of Labor\u2019s\n\nfinancial and temporal resources. Each case demanding interviews and/or a fact-finding\n\nproceeding necessitates extensive staff hours for scheduling, conducting interviews, reviewing\n\nevidence, and drafting detailed decisions. The need to send notices, accommodate witness\n\ntestimony, and facilitate cross-examination further escalates the time commitment. Moreover, the\n\npotential for subsequent appeals triggers a cascade of additional hearings and reviews, diverting\n\nresources from other essential departmental functions.\n\n196.   Moreover, where federal agencies fail to provide responses to requests for separation\n\ninformation, the Maryland Department of Labor must gather necessary wage and separation\n\ninformation. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 609.6 (e)(2). This requires claims staff to solicit evidence from the\n\nclaimants in the form of pay stubs, W-2s and affidavits and to pay benefits based on that\n\ninformation. In fact, recent federal guidance regarding federal unemployment during recent\n\ngovernment shutdowns encourages states to have claimants file an affidavit, using available proof,\n\ngiven \u201climited federal HR resources\u201d to respond to requests for separation information.\n\n\u201cUnemployment Insurance Program Letter 03-22,\u201d U.S. Department of Labor, November 2022,\n\nhttps://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/ETA/advisories/UIPL/2021/UIPL_03-22.pdf.\n\n197.   In addition, termination notices issued by federal agencies were not issued in compliance\n\nwith governing reduction in force procedures. It is apparent that there are affected individuals,\n\nincluding veterans, who should have been accorded preference under required RIF procedures but\n\n\n\n\n                                               40\n                                             JA61\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA           Document 1        Filed 03/06/25      Page 41 of 55\n\n\n\nwere not. To the extent that preferences and other such requirements would have precluded\n\ntermination, and federal employees successfully challenge their separations, this will cause the\n\nDepartment to re-adjudicate claims, pursue overpayments, and conduct appeals.\n\n198.   While the federal Government provides grants for the purpose of administrating state\n\nunemployment benefit programs, these grants are frequently less than the total administrative costs\n\nincurred by Maryland. And that is the case now; the federal grant monies allocated to Maryland\n\nare not sufficient to cover Maryland\u2019s unemployment benefit program administration.\n\n199.   In these circumstances, Maryland relies on its Special Administrative Expense Fund\n\n(\u201cSAEF\u201d) when federal funding is insufficient. See Md. Code Ann., Labor & Employment \u00a7\u00a7 8-\n\n419 to 842. This fund may be comprised of previously transferred federal funds (in limited\n\ncircumstances), as well as monies collected by the state through fines, interest, and other penalties,\n\nand contributions by the state legislature. Id. \u00a7 8-421. Currently, SAEF is comprised entirely of\n\nstate funds. Accordingly, any increase in administrative costs of Maryland\u2019s unemployment\n\nbenefits program will be covered at least in part by state funds.\n\n200.   Other Plaintiff States must also undergo intensive and mandatory investigation and appeal\n\nprocesses for handling disputes between claimants and employers involving the claimant\u2019s\n\neligibility. Many Plaintiff States anticipate a significant increase in these disputes given the\n\nDefendants\u2019 chaotic and conflicting messaging around the reasons for terminating probationary\n\nemployees. Handling these disputes will cause those Plaintiff States to divert staff to handle the\n\ntime-consuming dispute resolutions and hinder the timely processing of ordinary unemployment\n\nclaims that are not disputed.\n\n201.   For example, the Illinois Department of Employment Security (\u201cIDES\u201d) has already\n\nreceived almost the same number of applications for unemployment benefits from former federal\n\n\n\n\n                                                 41\n                                               JA62\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA          Document 1       Filed 03/06/25      Page 42 of 55\n\n\n\nworkers this year as it received in all of last year. A substantial number of these claims require\n\nresource intensive fact-finding that will cause backlogs and delays in IDES\u2019s processing of other\n\nclaims, exacerbating economic hardship for countless Illinoisans.\n\n202.   IDES is also being forced to divert resources and staff to respond to the latest layoff news,\n\nto identify affected federal agencies and ex-employees, provide information, and adjust procedures\n\nand resources to assist confused and unemployed workers in Illinois, all in a complicated and\n\nrapidly evolving environment. To take one example, IDES had to create a new webpage, at\n\nsignificant time and expense, in an attempt to provide resources and services. See\n\nhttps://ides.illinois.gov/unemployment/deferred-resignation-of-federal-employees.html.        Such\n\nefforts could normally be targeted at specific personnel subject to impending layoff events but\n\nmust instead be provided less efficiently and at greater expense to the entire public because IDES\n\npersonnel remain unaware of the individuals who have already been laid off and whether and when\n\nthe next federal mass layoff event will occur.\n\n203.    In some jurisdictions, a flood of contested UI claims will cause a backlog that affects the\n\ntimely adjudication of a wide range of administrative matters that are handled by the same\n\nadministrative law judges (\u201cALJs\u201d), ranging from building code enforcement to traffic tickets.\n\n204.   Plaintiff States have seen or anticipate seeing an uptick in UI claims in the areas in which\n\nthe probationary employee layoffs occurred. This sudden increase\u2014without any advanced\n\nnotice\u2014has burdened and will continue to burden state agencies charged with administering UI\n\nbenefits.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 42\n                                             JA63\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA             Document 1     Filed 03/06/25      Page 43 of 55\n\n\n\n                              Expenditures for Other Social Services\n\n205.   Plaintiff States bear other burdens associated with many residents suddenly losing income.\n\nThese costs arise in the administration of programs aimed at providing connections to social\n\nservices, like health care and food assistance.\n\n206.   Newly unemployed individuals apply for Medicaid at high rates, and the Plaintiff States\n\nbear a direct economic cost to provide healthcare services to them and their families.\n\n                 Harms to State Programs That Depend on Federal Employees\n\n207.   Many federal probationary employees who were terminated by the CDC were detailed to\n\nwork at Plaintiff States\u2019 public health agencies. This includes several employees who were hired\n\nby the CDC as part of its Public Health Associate Program for Recent Graduates (\u201cPHAP\u201d). PHAP\n\nis a two-year program that places recent college graduates with tribal, local, and territorial public\n\nhealth agencies, as well as non-governmental organizations, to work alongside other public health\n\nprofessionals in a variety of settings.\n\n208.   For example, three recently terminated PHAP employees (\u201cAssociates\u201d) were assigned to\n\nNew Jersey\u2019s Department of Health (\u201cNJDOH\u201d), which is responsible for preventing the spread\n\nof infectious diseases and developing emergency preparedness plans in the state. CDC and\n\nNJDOH entered into a two-year contract, pursuant to which CDC agreed to cover all costs for the\n\nAssociates, including salary and benefits. NJDOH has participated in the PHAP program for\n\nseveral years and often hires PHAP Associates, who gain invaluable training and institutional\n\nknowledge over the course of the program, for permanent employment at the conclusion of their\n\ntwo-year term.\n\n209.   The three Associates were detailed to different NJDOH divisions that perform core public\n\nhealth functions: the Division of HIV, STD, and TB Services; the Epidemiology, Environmental\n\n\n\n\n                                                  43\n                                              JA64\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA           Document 1        Filed 03/06/25      Page 44 of 55\n\n\n\nand Occupational Health\u2019s Communicable Disease Service; and the Global Tuberculosis Institute\n\nat Rutgers University. Each Associate was a member of a small team dedicated to reducing the\n\nspread of communicable diseases such as HIV, TB, and foodborne and waterborne illnesses. This\n\nwork involved laborious investigations, contact tracing, and collaborations with numerous local,\n\nstate, and federal partners to ensure anyone infected or at risk of infection has access to treatment.\n\n210.   Between February 16 and 17, 2025, NJDOH learned that the three Associates had been\n\nterminated from their positions on February 15, 2025\u2014before the expiration of their contractual\n\ntwo-year terms. CDC never notified NJDOH of these terminations. Between March 4 and 5,\n\nNJDOH learned that the Associates were being reinstated.\n\n211.   Despite their reinstatement, the sudden loss of essential personnel, coupled with the lack\n\nof notice, caused NJDOH significant harm and disruption. NJDOH had invested significant time\n\nand resources into months-long training for the Associates, and the agency did not have the\n\nbudgetary flexibility or hiring authority to replace them, particularly given the lack of any notice.\n\nThe unexpected staffing shortages and imminent need to reallocate and train existing staff already\n\ncaused delays and administrative chaos, which impeded NJDOH\u2019s ability to fulfill its mission of\n\nlimiting the spread of infectious diseases in the state. The timing of the terminations was especially\n\nproblematic because NJDOH has been dealing with numerous communicable disease challenges,\n\nincluding H5N1, measles, Covid-19, influenza, norovirus, and RSV. The loss in workforce\n\ncapacity during this time hampered NJDOH\u2019s ability to fully respond to these public health threats.\n\n212.   The lack of notice compounded the challenges created by the terminations. NJDOH was\n\nnot able to plan for the terminations, resulting in administrative inefficiencies, duplicative work,\n\nand delayed notifications to persons exposed to certain communicable diseases.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 44\n                                               JA65\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA           Document 1        Filed 03/06/25     Page 45 of 55\n\n\n\n                                     Harms to State Finances\n\n213.   The mass layoffs that have taken place without the legally required notice to Plaintiff States\n\nwill also have substantial impacts on the Plaintiff States\u2019 finances.\n\n214.   For instance, the U.S. Secretary of Labor has discretion to reimburse states for\n\nadministrative costs required to conduct the state unemployment compensation program. 42 U.S.C.\n\n\u00a7 502(a). While many Plaintiff States have been and continue to expend additional resources\n\nnecessary to address the uptick in federal unemployment claims, it is not yet known whether those\n\nadditional costs will be fully reimbursed.\n\n215.   Further, Plaintiff States rely in large part on income tax revenue for their budgets. Because\n\nDefendant agencies will no longer be withholding and paying income taxes to Plaintiff States on\n\nbehalf of the terminated probationary employees, the layoffs will result in a decrease to Plaintiff\n\nStates\u2019 revenues. Given the number of employees forced to seek reemployment\u2014with no notice\n\nand no opportunity for Plaintiff States to provide support services\u2014it is highly likely that many of\n\nthe Plaintiff States\u2019 residents will be unemployed for prolonged periods, depriving the Plaintiff\n\nStates of significant income tax receipts.\n\n216.   For example, the District of Columbia estimates that the mass terminations of probationary\n\nemployees will cause millions of dollars in lost annual income tax revenue. The District estimates\n\nthat its lost income tax revenue for the first 60 days alone, the period in which it should have\n\nreceived advance notice of any RIFs, will cost the District at least hundreds of thousands of dollars\n\nin lost income tax revenue. Had the District received the notice required by law, these losses would\n\nlikely have been mitigated, including because employees would not have been terminated during\n\nthe 60-day notice period and some would have been able to obtain alternative employment prior\n\nto their termination.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 45\n                                              JA66\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA          Document 1         Filed 03/06/25     Page 46 of 55\n\n\n\n217.   Likewise, the Maryland Comptroller projects that the mass terminations of probationary\n\nemployees will cause significant decreases in Maryland\u2019s income tax revenues. Maryland\u2019s budget\n\nrelies in large part on personal income tax revenue, which represented 55% of Maryland\u2019s general\n\nfund revenues for fiscal year 2024. Approximately 250,000 federal workers reside in Maryland.\n\nAlthough unemployed individuals receiving unemployment benefits generally pay income tax on\n\ntheir benefits, the benefits paid are less than the amount the individuals earned when they were\n\nfully employed, and therefore the taxes paid are generally less than the taxes paid during their\n\nemployment.\n\n218.   Beyond the direct loss of income tax revenue, the Maryland Comptroller anticipates that a\n\nsudden and significant increase of newly unemployed workers will have serious negative effects\n\non Maryland\u2019s labor market, including extended periods of unemployment, downward pressure on\n\nwages, and the migration of residents out of the state.\n\n219.   The terminations also impact state sales tax revenues.\n\n220.   For example, for the District of Columbia, this impact comes from two primary sources:\n\nFirst, federal employees living outside of the District who commute to work in the District\n\npurchase meals at restaurants, pay parking fees, and purchase other goods and services before,\n\nduring, and after work. Second, in addition to these workday purchases, federal employees who\n\nare District residents also contribute to our economy as full-time residents, spending on groceries,\n\nhousehold items, restaurants, clothing, and various services.\n\n221.   The District estimates that these mass terminations could cause anywhere from hundreds\n\nof thousands to millions of dollars in lost annual sales tax revenue. The District further estimates\n\nthat for the first 60 days alone, the period in which it should have received advance notice of any\n\nRIFs, the District will lose tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars in sales tax revenues. Had the\n\n\n\n\n                                                 46\n                                              JA67\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA           Document 1        Filed 03/06/25       Page 47 of 55\n\n\n\nDistrict received the notice required by law, these losses would likely have been mitigated,\n\nincluding because employees would not have been terminated during the 60-day notice period and\n\nsome would have been able to obtain alternative employment prior to their termination.\n\n\n\n                                     CLAIMS FOR RELIEF\n                                           COUNT I\n                        Violation of the Administrative Procedures Act\n                             Action Not in Accordance with Law\n\n222.   Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate herein by reference every allegation and paragraph set\n\nforth previously.\n\n223.   Under the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d), a court shall \u201chold unlawful and set\n\naside agency action . . . found to be . . . arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise\n\nnot in accordance with law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A).\n\n224.   Defendants are agencies subject to the APA. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701.\n\n225.   Because Defendants\u2019 mass terminations of probationary employees are part of an effort to\n\nrestructure and reduce the federal workforce, they constitute RIFs, and Defendants were obligated\n\nto follow RIF procedures set forth by statute and regulation to carry out the terminations. See 5\n\nU.S.C. \u00a7 3502; 5 C.F.R. Part 351.\n\n226.   Defendants violated the law by carrying out the mass terminations of probationary\n\nemployees without following the required RIF procedures, see 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502; 5 C.F.R. Part 351,\n\nincluding providing 60 days\u2019 notice to states and affected employees before releasing the\n\nemployees, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d). Absent such notice, an employee \u201cmay not be released.\u201d 5 U.S.C.\n\n\u00a7 3502(d).\n\n227.   The actions of Defendants therefore violate the APA because they are not in accordance\n\nwith law in violation of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A).\n\n\n                                                  47\n                                               JA68\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA           Document 1        Filed 03/06/25       Page 48 of 55\n\n\n\n                                          COUNT II\n                        Violation of the Administrative Procedures Act\n                                   Arbitrary and Capricious\n\n228.   Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate herein by reference every allegation and paragraph set\n\nforth previously.\n\n229.   Under the APA, a court shall \u201chold unlawful and set aside agency action . . . found to be\n\n. . . arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d 5 U.S.C.\n\n\u00a7 706(2)(A).\n\n230.   Defendants are agencies subject to the APA. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701.\n\n231.   The terminations of probationary employees pursuant to OPM\u2019s order have been arbitrary\n\nand capricious in several respects, including:\n\n232.   Defendants OPM and OPM Director failed to provide a reasoned explanation for their\n\ndirection to agencies to carry out mass terminations of probationary employees without following\n\nRIF procedures.\n\n233.   Defendants failed to provide a reasoned explanation for following OPM\u2019s direction and\n\ncarrying out mass terminations of probationary employees.\n\n234.   Third, to the extent Defendants provided any explanation at all for the mass terminations,\n\nthe reasons given were pretextual as they purported to relate to individual employees\u2019 performance\n\nbut did not identify any actual unsatisfactory performance or conduct or any reasons preceding the\n\naffected employees\u2019 appointments that justified their terminations. Rather than Defendants\u2019 stated\n\nreasons, Defendants\u2019 true reason for terminating the probationary employees was to reduce the\n\nsize of the federal workforce.\n\n235.   The arbitrariness of Defendants\u2019 actions and the indiscriminate nature of the terminations\n\nis underscored by the fact that Defendants have had to reverse the firings of individuals fulfilling\n\n\n\n\n                                                  48\n                                                 JA69\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA            Document 1       Filed 03/06/25       Page 49 of 55\n\n\n\ncertain critical functions, such as protecting nuclear weapons and addressing a significant public\n\nhealth threat.\n\n                                         COUNT III\n                              Non-Statutory Review of Ultra Vires Action\n\n236.    Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate herein by reference every allegation and paragraph set\n\nforth previously.\n\n237.    Plaintiffs have a non-statutory right of action to enjoin and declare unlawful official action\n\nthat is ultra vires.\n\n238.    Defendants mass terminations of probationary employees were RIFs. These RIFs were\n\nunlawful because Defendants conducted them without following required RIF procedures, see 5\n\nU.S.C. \u00a7 3502; 5 C.F.R. Part 351, including providing 60 days\u2019 notice to states and affected\n\nemployees before releasing the employees, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d). Absent such notice, an employee\n\n\u201cmay not be released.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d).\n\n239.    Defendants\u2019 actions terminating probationary employees en masse therefore exceeded their\n\nlawful authority and were ultra vires.\n\n240.    Plaintiffs will suffer irreparable injury if Defendants\u2019 actions are not declared unlawful and\n\nenjoined, and Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law.\n\n241.    The public interest favors issuance of a judicial declaration that Defendants\u2019 terminations\n\nof federal probationary employees are unlawful and issuance of an injunction requiring Defendants\n\nto reinstate the affected employees and to follow RIF procedures for any further RIFs. Defendants\u2019\n\nactions have resulted in the unlawful termination of tens of thousands of probationary federal\n\nemployees, including large numbers of military veterans, causing a sudden surge of unemployment\n\nwithout providing Plaintiff States with notice or an opportunity to prepare.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 49\n                                               JA70\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA          Document 1       Filed 03/06/25     Page 50 of 55\n\n\n\n                                   PRAYER FOR RELIEF\n\n       WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court:\n\n242.   Declare unlawful and set aside Defendants\u2019 terminations of probationary employees\n\nwithout making specific, individualized determinations regarding the employees\u2019 performance or\n\nconduct and without adhering to RIF requirements as arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion,\n\nor otherwise not in accordance with law under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A);\n\n243.   Declare unlawful and set aside Defendants\u2019 terminations of probationary employees\n\nwithout making specific, individualized determinations regarding the employees\u2019 performance or\n\nconduct and without adhering to RIF requirements as ultra vires and exceeding their lawful\n\nauthority;\n\n244.   Issue immediate temporary relief restraining Defendants from terminating any\n\nprobationary employees without making specific, individualized determinations regarding the\n\ninadequacy of the employee\u2019s conduct or performance and reinstating probationary employees\n\nwho were terminated on or after January 20, 2025, as part of mass terminations that did not comply\n\nwith RIF procedures and were not based on individualized determinations of the inadequacy of the\n\nemployee\u2019s conduct or performance;\n\n245.   Order Defendants to file a status report with the Court within 48 hours of entry of a\n\ntemporary restraining order, and at regular intervals thereafter, identifying all probationary\n\nemployees terminated on or after January 20, 2025 (including the following information for each\n\nemployee: agency, name, position title, grade, termination date, whether the probationary\n\nemployee has been reinstated, and the date of any reinstatement), and reporting all steps that\n\nDefendants have taken to comply with the Court\u2019s temporary restraining order;\n\n\n\n\n                                               50\n                                             JA71\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA         Document 1         Filed 03/06/25      Page 51 of 55\n\n\n\n246.   Enter preliminary and permanent injunctive relief enjoining any further terminations that\n\ndo not follow the RIF requirements or requirements for separating probationary employees for\n\nperformance and enjoining Defendants from separating any employees pursuant to a RIF prior to\n\nthe reinstatement of the probationary employees described above;\n\n247.    Award to Plaintiffs their costs of litigation including, but not limited to, reasonable\n\nattorneys\u2019 fees, under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412, and any other applicable law; and\n\n248.

WU, declare as follows:\n\n\n       1.      I am a resident of the State of Maryland. I am over the age of 18 and have\n\npersonal knowledge of all the facts stated herein, except to those matters stated upon information\n\nand belief; as to those matters, I believe them to be true. If called as a witness, I could and would\n\ntestify competently to the matters set forth below.\n\n       2.      I am currently employed by the Maryland Department of Labor as the Secretary\n\nof Labor.\n\n       3.      The Maryland Department of Labor (MD Labor) is responsible for connecting\n\nMarylanders to good jobs; protecting workers, consumers, and the public; supporting Maryland\n\nbusinesses; and fostering economic growth and competitiveness. The Department administers a\n\nwide range of federally funded workforce and training programs, including but not limited to\n\nthose authorized by the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), that are vital to\n\nMaryland's economic stability and workforce development. The Department is the designated\n\n\n                                                    1\n\n\n                                               JA78\n\f         Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB        Document 4-5       Filed 03/07/25      Page 3 of 17\n\n\nstate agency for oversight and coordination of federally required Rapid Response activities in the\n\nstate.\n\n         4.    As Secretary of Labor, I have access to comprehensive reports and financial\n\nrecords that detail the state of Maryland's labor market, including claims for unemployment\n\nbenefits, and the allocation and distribution of federal funding received by the Maryland\n\nDepartment of Labor. Additionally, my role includes oversight of the implementation and\n\ncompliance of federally funded programs within the agency, ensuring all expenditures align with\n\nfederal guidelines and regulations.\n\n         5.    According to our Department's most recent analysis, there are an estimated\n\n160,000 federal civilian jobs located in Maryland and approximately 250,000 individuals reside\n\nin Maryland who work in federal civilian service. This includes workers stationed in the District\n\nof Columbia who commute from their Maryland residence, and multiple federal agencies that are\n\nphysically located in the state. The average annual earnings for federal civilian jobs in Maryland\n\nis nearly $127,000. At least seven Maryland counties have more than 10,000 residents employed\n\nby the federal government.\n\n         6.      For example, Montgomery County is home to several large federal agencies,\n\nsuch as the National Institutes for Health (which has approximately 18,000 jobs located in\n\nMaryland) and the Food and Drug Administration (which has approximately 13,000 jobs located\n\nin Maryland). Baltimore County is home to the Social Security Administration (which has about\n\n9,000 jobs located in Maryland) and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (which has\n\nnearly 4,000 jobs located in Maryland).\n\n\n\n\n                                                 2\n\n                                              JA79\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 4-5       Filed 03/07/25      Page 4 of 17\n\n\n       7.      Furthermore, official estimates of the federal workforce in Maryland undercount\n\nthe number of potentially impacted jobs due to the heavy presence of classified positions, such as\n\nat the National Security Agency located in Anne Arundel County.\n\n       8.      Maryland is also home to a significant military presence, hosting over a dozen\n\nmilitary installations. According to the most recent statistics from the Department of Defense,\n\nthere were 29,564 active-duty military personnel and an additional 17,988 national guard/reserve\n\npersonnel stationed in Maryland as of June 2024 for a total of 47,552 military personnel. Top\n\nbranches of the military represented in Maryland include 9,701 active-duty Navy personnel,\n\n8,468 active duty Air Force personnel, and 7,822 active duty Army personnel.\n\nRapid Response Expenditures\n\n       9.      The Maryland Department of Labor is the designated state agency with\n\nresponsibility for oversight and coordination of statewide Rapid Response activities, required by\n\n29 U.S.C. \u00a7 3174(a)(2)(A) undertaken to provide immediate assistance to Marylanders subject to\n\nmass layoffs. Per 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 682.302, the State Workforce Agency must deliver Rapid\n\nResponse services for mass layoffs that meet the agency's definition of mass layoff, as long as\n\nthe definition does not exceed a minimum threshold of 50 affected workers. In Maryland, \"mass\n\nlayoff' is defined as a layoff from work of 25 or more workers in a single establishment for an\n\nexpected duration of 7 days or more, at the same time, and for the same reason.\n\n       10.     The Maryland Department of Labor oversees state rapid response effort, as\n\nrequired by both the federal Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act 29 U.S.C.\n\n\u00a7 3174(a)(2)(A), and Maryland's Economic Stabilization Act, see Md. Ann. Code Labor and\n\nEmployment, \u00a7 11-303-304 (referred to as \"quick response program\").\n\n\n\n\n                                                 3\n\n                                             JA80\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 4-5       Filed 03/07/25      Page 5 of 17\n\n\n       11.     Rapid Response activities are intended to reduce reliance on public benefit\n\nsystems, such as unemployment insurance; to promote economic recovery and vitality by\n\ndeveloping an ongoing, comprehensive approach to identify, plan for, and respond to layoffs and\n\ndislocations; and to prevent or minimize the impact of mass layoffs on workers, businesses, and\n\ncommunities.\n\n\n       12.     Pursuant to both federal and state regulations and policies, when properly notified\n\nof a qualifying event Maryland deploys a coordinated Rapid Response \"team\" comprised of the\n\nDepartment's Dislocated Services Unit (DSU), and Division of Unemployment Insurance staff,\n\nas well as personnel from the state's 13 Local Workforce Development Areas (formal\n\nsubrecipients under WIOA Title I) and the Professional Outplacement Assistance Center.\n\nCollaboratively, these partners are required to provide informational resources and\n\nreemployment services for workers, including information and support for filing Unemployment\n\nInsurance (UI) claims, information regarding health coverage or other benefits, information on\n\nand referral to career services, reemployment-focused workshops and services, and occupational\n\ntraining.\n\n        13.    In addition, the DSU is responsible for contacting affected employers to collect,\n\nverify, and distribute information regarding impact on workers so that services can be rapidly\n\ndeployed. Rapid Response teams, in coordination with the DSU and other listed partners,\n\ncoordinate directly with employers, workers, and relevant partner organizations to provide rapid\n\nsupport and referrals to the American Job Centers located in the affected jurisdictions to provide\n\nsupport for the affected workers. The Division of Unemployment Insurance will mobilize to\n\nstreamline and expedite the processing of unemployment claims.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 4\n\n                                              JA81\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB            Document 4-5        Filed 03/07/25       Page 6 of 17\n\n\n       14.     Rapid Response partners also facilitate connections to partner agencies and\n\norganizations to ensure their ability to provide timely assistance to terminated workers and their\n\nfamilies, such as home heating assistance, legal aid, and financial advice. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\n\n3502(d)(3)(A)(i), the federal government is required to provide written notice to Maryland, or\n\n\"the State or entity designated by the State to carry out rapid response activities under section\n\n134(a)(2)(A) of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998\" of a plan for a reduction-in-force (RIF)\n\nof federal employees, generally at least 60 days in advance of any proposed RIF. This period\n\nmay only be shortened upon written notice and in no event shall be less than 30 days. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\n\n3502(e)(3). This notice is to be provided at the same time the federal government issues specific\n\nnotices of separation to employees.\n\n       15.     That notice must include the number of employees to be separated from the\n\nagency/agencies, and the effective date of the separations, as well as other information required\n\nby the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. The notice required by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d)(3)(A) is\n\nintended to trigger Rapid Response activities, since it is explicitly to be given to the state entity\n\nrequired to carry out rapid response activities.\n\n       16.     The Maryland Department of Labor has not received the required advance notice\n\nof a federal reduction in force from any federal agency with locations in the state. Nor, to the\n\nbest of my knowledge, has any other entity in the Maryland State Government received notice of\n\na federal reduction in force.\n\n        17.     Yet, as detailed more below, the Maryland Department of Labor has already\n\nreceived at least 813 claims by ex-federal employees for unemployment benefits since January\n\n21, 2025. The Department is also aware of public announcements of significant layoffs at\n\n\n\n\n                                                   5\n\n                                                JA82\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 4-5        Filed 03/07/25      Page 7 of 17\n\n\nMaryland and D.C.-located federal agencies, including the Social Security Administration and\n\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs.\n\n       18.     The Department of Labor has also seen a significant uptick of new\n\nUnemployment Insurance claims of ex-federal employees just in the last few weeks, with an\n\napproximate range of 30 to 60 new such claims every day.\n\n       19.     In light of these claims and public reporting about ongoing and forthcoming\n\nfederal layoffs, in order to comply with federal and state obligations, Departmental personnel\n\nhave contacted dozens of federal agencies and offices to seek information as to whether mass\n\nlayoffs are being conducted currently or are being planned in the future.\n\n       20.     The Division of Workforce Development and Adult Learning, the unit within the\n\nDepartment that administers the Rapid Response program, along with other statewide partners at\n\nthe county and municipal level, have not received any substantive response as to these agencies'\n\nplans for mass layoffs.\n\n       21.     Because the Department has received no notice of federal RIFs, despite extensive\n\noutreach, we are dedicating significantly more staff, resources, and expenditures to fulfill our\n\nstatutory obligation.\n\n       22.     Indeed, because we have not received the statutorily required advance notice of\n\nwhich agencies are planning to conduct mass layoffs, the Department has been forced to rely on\n\npublic reporting and word-of-mouth to conduct after-the-fact outreach to potentially affected\n\nworkers. Reacting after a layoff is far more resource-intensive than the advance planning and\n\nassistance process required by law.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 6\n\n                                              JA83\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 4-5        Filed 03/07/25       Page 8 of 17\n\n\n       23.       As referenced above, Department staff have conducted extensive affirmative\n\noutreach to federal agencies and offices to try and determine the location and extent of upcoming\n\nlayoffs.\n\n       24.       Moreover, the Department of Labor has had to devote significant additional staff\n\ntime from fiscal, communications, grant management, operational and administrative, and policy\n\nteams to conduct broad-based outreach to try and identify recently terminated employees, to\n\nattempt to provide relevant resources and services rapidly.\n\n       25.       While Rapid Response activities are generally funded through federal\n\nappropriations under WIOA Title I, the additional burden of responding and the related expenses\n\nhas required the Department to divert multiple staff from important state projects.\n\n       26.       For example, several individuals in the Department's Office of the Secretary and\n\nOffice of Administration have been diverted from working on state matters to handle the federal\n\nresponse. Such state matters that are being affected through the diversion of staff include\n\noccupational and professional licensing oversight, financial regulation, state\n\nworkforce development programs, and matters related to other non-federally funded activities of\n\nthe Maryland Department of Labor.\n\n           27.   In addition, other Department personnel have been diverted from state-funded\n\nworkforce development projects, including the Employment Advancement Right Now\n\n(\"EARN\") program, which is a Maryland's premiere workforce development grant initiative\n\nserving over 5,000 constituents annually.\n\n           28.   However, such staff have been instead dedicated to reacting to the latest layoff\n\nnews, trying to identify the affected federal agency and ex-employees, provide information, and\n\n\n\n\n                                                  7\n\n                                               JA84\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 4-5       Filed 03/07/25      Page 9 of 17\n\n\notherwise adjust procedures and resources to assist confused and unemployed Marylanders in a\n\ncomplicated and rapidly evolving environment.\n\n       29.     As just one example of these efforts, Department staff created a new website,\n\nrequiring significant time and expense, see Maryland Workers Impacted by Recent Federal\n\nActions, https://response.maryland.gov/federalpublicservants/. This effort was a further attempt\n\nto provide resources and services, which could normally be targeted at specific personnel\n\nimpacted in future layoff events, but must instead be provided less efficiently and at greater\n\nexpense to the entire public, because our personnel remain unaware of whether and when the\n\nnext federal mass layoff event will occur, and who has been impacted and is in need of support.\n\n       30.     In sum, every day that goes by, the Department is devoting significant time,\n\nresources, and expense to simply try and identify workers subject to federal mass layoffs,\n\nconduct mass outreach, and otherwise make resources available to potentially affected\n\nindividuals in new ways, all because federal agencies have failed to provide us the legally\n\nrequired notice of mass layoffs.\n\nUnemployment Assistance Process\n\n       31.     The Maryland Department of Labor also manages claims for unemployment\n\nbenefits by individuals formerly employed to work in Maryland.\n\n       32.     The Unemployment Compensation Law of Maryland (Title 8 of the Maryland\n\nCode, Labor and Employment Article in its entirety), enacted in 1936, provides insurance\n\nbenefits, over an extended period of time, to persons who become unemployed through no fault\n\nof their own. Md. Code Ann. Lab. & Empl. Art. \u00a78-102(d).\n\n        33.    As a general matter, the federal Government is required to reimburse Maryland\n\nfor unemployment benefits provided to former federal employees. Specifically, Maryland is\n\n\n\n                                                 8\n\n                                               JA85\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 4-5        Filed 03/07/25      Page 10 of 17\n\n\nparty to an agreement with the United States Secretary of Labor, wherein the Maryland\n\nDepartment of Labor pays, as an agent of the United States, Unemployment Compensation for\n\nFederal Employees (\"UCFE\") pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8502(a).\n\n       34.     Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8502(b), Maryland is reimbursed for UCFE payments to\n\nfederal employees in the same amount, on the same terms, and subject to the same conditions\n\nwhich would be payable to them under Maryland Unemployment Compensation Law.\n\n       35.     In addition, the Maryland Department of Labor administers its federal-state\n\ncooperative unemployment insurance program, financed in large part by grants from the federal\n\ngovernment pursuant to the Social Security Act. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 501-503.\n\n       36.     The Maryland Unemployment Insurance Compensation Program, certified by the\n\nU.S. Secretary of Labor under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7502(a), provides for payment of insurance benefits for\n\nup to twenty-six (26) weeks to persons who find themselves unemployed through no fault of\n\ntheir own. Md Code. Ann. Lab. & Empl. \u00a7\u00a7 8-201-223, 8-801, 8-808, 8-901-910, 1001-1009.\n\n       37.     While the federal Government provides grants for the purpose of administrating\n\nstate unemployment benefit programs, these grants are frequently less than the total\n\nadministrative costs incurred by Maryland. And that is the case now; the federal grant monies\n\nallocated to Maryland are not sufficient to adequately cover our unemployment benefit program\n\nadministration.\n\n       38.     In these circumstances, Maryland relies on its Special Administrative Expense\n\nFund (SAEF) when federal funding is insufficient. See Md. Code Ann., Labor & Employment\n\n\u00a7\u00a7 8-419 to 842. This fund may be comprised of previously transferred federal funds (in limited\n\ncircumstances), as well as monies collected by the state through fines, interest, and other\n\npenalties, and contributions by the state legislature. Id. \u00a7 8-421. Currently, SAEF is comprised\n\n\n\n                                                 9\n\n                                              JA86\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB            Document 4-5        Filed 03/07/25     Page 11 of 17\n\n\nentirely of state funds. Accordingly, any increase in administrative costs of our unemployment\n\nbenefits program will be covered at least in part by state funds.\n\n       39.       Pursuant to Md. Code Ann. Lab. & Empl. \u00a7 8-805(a), an individual in Maryland\n\nwho wishes to collect unemployment insurance benefits must file a claim in accordance with\n\nregulations adopted by the Maryland Secretary of Labor.\n\n       40.       Claimants file claims online using the Department's system to assert a claim\n\ninitially and to provide information to indicate the basis of the claim, the name of the claimant's\n\nprevious employer, the reason for her separation, work experience, and other relevant\n\ninformation. Md. Code Regs. \u00a7 09.32.02.05.\n\n       41.       The reason for termination alleged by the claimant is then transmitted to the\n\nclaimant's employer(s) for verification. The employer is then asked to furnish a report of the\n\nseparation from employment containing, inter alia, the reason for the employee's separation and\n\na report of wage history. Md. Code Ann. Lab. & Empl. \u00a7 8-627; see also Md. Code Regs.\n\n\u00a7 09.32.02.05.\n\n       42.       There are various reasons why a claimant may be ineligible for, or disqualified\n\nfrom, receiving benefits. As a baseline, to be eligible for unemployment benefits, the individual\n\nmust be unemployed. Md. Code. Ann. Lab. & Empl. \u00a7 8-801(a). A person is considered\n\nunemployed during any week they: (1) do not perform work for which wages are payable; or (2)\n\nwork less than full-time and earn wages less than their assigned weekly benefit amount. Md.\n\nCode. Ann. Lab. & Empl. \u00a7 8-801(b). However, a part-time worker is not considered\n\nunemployed if they are working all the hours they are available for. Md. Code. Ann. Lab. &\n\nEmpl. \u00a7 8-801(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                                  10\n\n\n                                                JA87\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 4-5        Filed 03/07/25      Page 12 of 17\n\n\n       43.     Additionally, a claimant is ineligible if they did not earn requisite wages within\n\nthe first four of the last five completed calendar quarters, or alternatively the four most recent\n\ncalendar quarters, before their claim is filed. Md. Code. Ann. Lab. & Empl. \u00a7\u00a7 8-101(b) and 8-\n\n802.\n\n       44.     Maryland law disqualifies some claimants from benefits depending on the\n\ncircumstances of their separation from employment. See Md. Code Ann. Lab. & Empl. \u00a7 8-\n\n1001, et seq. A claimant is disqualified if they quit their job without good cause directly related\n\nto employment conditions or employer actions. Md. Code Ann. Lab. & Empl. \u00a7 8-1001(a).\n\nOther disqualifying circumstances include, inter alia, termination for misconduct, aggravated\n\nmisconduct, and gross misconduct. Id.\n\n       45.     A claims examiner at the Maryland Department of Labor is charged with making\n\nan initial determination on the claim. Md. Code. Ann. Lab. & Empl. \u00a78-806(a)(1).\n\n       46.     If a determination involves a resolution of a dispute of material fact, the claims\n\nexaminer must conduct a predetermination fact-finding interview after notice is provided to the\n\nemployee and her employer(s). Md. Code. Ann. Lab & Empl. \u00a7 8-806(a)(2); Md. Code Regs.\n\n09.32.02.16E. At the fact-finding proceeding, conducted by the claims examiner, the parties can\n\noffer evidence and argument, cross-examine witnesses, and otherwise develop an administrative\n\nrecord. Md. Code Regs. \u00a7 09.32.02.16E.\n\n        47.      Thereafter, a written initial determination must be made stating, inter alia, the\n\nweekly benefit amount, maximum benefits payable to the claimant in a benefit year, and the\n\nreasons for the determination. Md. Code Ann. Lab. & Empl. \u00a7 8-806(c).\n\n        48.     If the claims examiner's review of a claim reveals no dispute of material fact, but\n\nthe information reviewed indicates that claimant may be ineligible or disqualified, the claims\n\n\n\n                                                  11\n\n                                                JA88\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 4-5        Filed 03/07/25      Page 13 of 17\n\n\nexaminers must still schedule a call for an appointment for a fact-finding interview and render a\n\nwritten decision. Md. Code Regs. 09.32.02.16(D) and (E).\n\n       49.     A claimant or an employer may file an administrative appeal within 15 days. Lab.\n\n& Empl. \u00a7 8-806(e)(1).\n\nUnemployment Benefits Recent Experience and Investigatory Process\n\n       50.     The Department of Labor's latest data indicates that at least 813 former federal\n\nemployees have applied for unemployment benefits since January 21, 2025.\n\n       51.     As noted above, the number of UCFE claims has increased significantly in just\n\nthe last few weeks, starting on or around February 14, 2025.\n\n       52.     In fact, the amount of UCFE claims received by the Maryland Department of\n\nLabor since January 21, 2025, is significantly higher than past years. By way of example, from\n\nJanuary 21, 2024, to March 3, 2024, we received only 189 unemployment claims containing\n\nfederal wages in the claimant's base period.\n\n       53.     While not required to apply for unemployment benefits, multiple individuals have\n\nattached in their application their letter of employment termination from the federal government.\n\nSuch letters indicate that these individuals were probationary employees purportedly terminated\n\nfor cause.\n\n       54.     When an employer provides the initial report of separation to the Department, the\n\nemployer must indicate the reason for the separation, including whether the employee was fired\n\nfor cause, such as misconduct.\n\n       55.     Accordingly, if an employer states in its report of separation that an individual\n\nwas terminated because performance has not been adequate to justify further employment at the\n\n\n\n\n                                                12\n\n                                               JA89\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB            Document 4-5       Filed 03/07/25      Page 14 of 17\n\n\nAgency, the Maryland Department of Labor's procedures require that the claims examiner must\n\ninvestigate the reason for discharge.\n\n       56.     The Maryland Department of Labor is required to verify both wages and reason\n\nfor separation of employment from each federal agency by sending a request for wage and\n\nseparation information. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 609.6(e)(1), 609.21 through 609.25. While private\n\nemployers report wages each quarter for all employees into the Department's database, see Code\n\nMd. Regs. \u00a7 09.32.01.12, federal agencies are not required to regularly report active employee\n\nwages to the States.\n\n       57.     The same Department staff who handle regular unemployment claims also\n\nprocess and adjudicate UCFE claims. Redirecting staff from regular Unemployment Insurance\n\n(UI) claims to process and adjudicate Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees\n\n(UCFE) claims threatens to strain our resources - especially because the lack of notice denied the\n\nDepartment the opportunity to educate potential claimants on claims filing, certification of work\n\nsearch, and other matters. Lack of claimant awareness of program processes and requirements\n\nhas historically led claimants to compliance errors affecting their entitlement to benefits absent\n\nextensive work by Department staff to fix issues with their claims.\n\n       58.     This diversion of personnel will undoubtedly impede the timely processing of\n\nregular UI claims, creating significant backlogs and delays. The consequences will be far-\n\nreaching, affecting countless individuals who depend on swift resolutions to sustain their\n\nlivelihoods. By diverting resources, we compromise the efficiency and responsiveness of our\n\nclaims processing system, ultimately undermining public trust and exacerbating economic\n\nhardship.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 13\n\n                                              JA90\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 4-5       Filed 03/07/25      Page 15 of 17\n\n\n       59.     While the Department of Labor is only beginning to process these claims, our\n\nstaff has already begun the process of contacting relevant federal agencies to request information\n\non relevant terminations, to determine if they were in fact done for cause.\n\n       60.     Thus far, we have received at least 193 reports of separation from federal\n\nagencies, concerning their recently terminated employees.\n\n       61.     Several of the reports gave as a reason for termination only that there was a\n\n\"permanent lack of work due to a change in Presidential Administration.\"\n\n       62.     In addition, the Department received several reports from federal agencies\n\nexplicitly stating that the employees were \"laid off due to a reduction in force.\" Such reports\n\nwere received from multiple federal agencies not disclosed here out of an abundance of caution\n\nto preserve privacy.\n\n       63.     And, as relevant here, certain reports asserted that the employee at issue was\n\nterminated for cause, for instance due to \"unsatisfactory work performance\" and similar generic\n\nperformance-related bases.\n\n       64.     Similarly, other reports highlighted various potentially disqualifying\n\ncircumstances. For instance, agencies indicated that claimants might not be genuinely\n\nunemployed or had voluntarily resigned from their positions.\n\n       65.     These reports were received from multiple federal agencies not disclosed here out\n\nof an abundance of caution to preserve privacy.\n\n       66.     Yet at the same time, termination letters, as well as recent statements of the\n\nPresident and other federal officials, indicate that the overwhelming majority of recent federal\n\nterminations were not for-cause firings, based on individualized assessments of performance, but\n\n\n\n\n                                                  14\n\n                                               JA91\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 4-5        Filed 03/07/25      Page 16 of 17\n\n\ninstead constitute a Government-wide effort to shrink the size of the federal workforce, an\n\neffective reduction in force.\n\n       67.     Where federal agencies assert that certain individual federal employees were\n\nterminated for cause or are otherwise ineligible or disqualified from benefits, or where there is\n\ndisputed or conflicting information, our Department will be required to follow an intensive and\n\nmandatory investigative process for those unemployment claims.\n\n       68.     Department staff, due to regulatory requirements, must treat these separations as\n\npotential misconduct firings. This necessitates extensive investigations and fact-finding, leading\n\nto a considerable drain on resources and time, and adds delay to the benefit process.\n\n       69.     The procedures impose a significant strain on the Maryland Department of\n\nLabor's financial and temporal resources. Each case demanding interviews and/or a fact-finding\n\nproceeding necessitates extensive staff hours for scheduling, conducting interviews, reviewing\n\nevidence, and drafting detailed decisions. The need to send notices, accommodate witness\n\ntestimony, and facilitate cross-examination further escalates the time commitment. Moreover, the\n\npotential for subsequent appeals triggers a cascade of additional hearings and reviews, diverting\n\nresources from other essential departmental functions.\n\n        70.    Moreover, where federal agencies fail to provide responses to requests for\n\nseparation information, the onus is on the Department to gather necessary wage and separation\n\ninformation. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 609.6 (e)(2). This requires claims staff to solicit evidence from the\n\nclaimants in the form of pay stubs, W-2s and affidavits and to pay benefits based on that\n\ninformation. In fact, recent federal guidance regarding federal unemployment during recent\n\ngovernment shutdowns encourages states to have claimants file an affidavit, using available\n\nproof, given \"limited federal HR resources\" to respond to requests for separation information.\n\n\n\n                                                 15\n\n                                               JA92\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB             Document 4-5             Filed 03/07/25   Page 17 of 17\n\n\n\n\"Unemployment Insurance Program Letter 03-22,\" U.S. Department of Labor, November 2022,\n\nhttps://vvww.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/ETA/advisories/0IPL/2021/UIPL 03-22.pdf.\n\n        71.    Further, payment to large numbers of claimants without employer verification\n\nwas a direct cause of thousands of erroneous overpayments during the COVID-19 pandemic -\n\ncausing the Department to investigate, issue overpayment determinations, and litigate appeals.\n\n        72.     Additionally complicating matters, it has come to our attention that termination\n\nnotices issued by federal agencies were not issued in compliance with governing reduction in\n\nforce procedures. It is apparent that there are affected individuals, including veterans, who\n\nshould have been accorded preference under required RIF procedures but were not. To the\n\nextent that preferences and other requirements would have precluded termination, and federal\n\nemployees successfully challenge their separations, this will cause the Department to re-\n\nadjudicate claims, pursue overpayments, and conduct appeals.\n\n        73.    As noted above, because current federal appropriations are insufficient to fully\n\nsupport our unemployment benefits program, Maryland is already relying on state SAEF monies\n\nto cover the difference. Further administrative burdens and strain imposed by administrative\n\ninvestigations will therefore likely require additional state funds.\n\n       74.     The cumulative effect of these investigations translates to substantial expenditures\n\non personnel, administrative overhead, and the technological infrastructure required to manage\n\nthe burgeoning caseload, ultimately depleting the department's budget and hindering its ability to\n\naddress other critical labor-related issues.\n\n                                               Executed on March 6, 2025, at Annapolis, Maryland.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 PAirtia Y.

I am a resident of the State of Arizona. I am over the age of 18 and have personal\n\nknowledge of all the facts stated herein, except to those matters stated upon information and\n\nbelief; as to those matters, I believe them to be true. If called as a witness, I could and would\n\ntestify competently to the matters set forth below.\n\n       2.      I am currently employed by the Arizona Department of Economic Security\n\n(\u201cADES\u201d) as the Assistant Director, Division of Employment and Rehabilitation Services\n\n(\u201cDERS\u201d).\n\n       3.      ADES works with families, community organizations, advocates and State and\n\nfederal partners towards ensuring the safety and economic security of all Arizonans. In\n\nfurtherance of this goal, ADES assists individuals who are unemployed or underemployed, and\n\n                                                  1\n\n\n                                               JA95\n\f          Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB       Document 4-6       Filed 03/07/25     Page 3 of 5\n\n\n\nthose with barriers to employment, to prepare for, obtain, and sustain gainful employment.\n\nAmong other things, ADES delivers employment and training services administered through\n\nvarious programs at the state and local level under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity\n\nAct (WIOA).\n\n          4.   For example, ADES manages claims for unemployment benefits by individuals\n\nformerly employed to work in Arizona.\n\n          5.   As Assistant Director, DERS, I can request and be given information about\n\nrecords relating to claims for unemployment benefits through the Unemployment Insurance (UI)\n\nprogram.\n\n          6.   Currently, those records show that in 2024, ADES received 234 regular UI initial\n\nclaims for benefits for which a federal employer was identified as the last employer during the\n\nmonths of January and February. In 2025, ADES received 286 regular UI initial claims for\n\nbenefits for which a federal employer was identified as the last employer during the same time\n\nperiod.\n\n          7.   ADES also is the state entity responsible for conducting outreach and providing\n\nunemployment services required by the federal Workforce Investment Act of 1998, as amended\n\nby the federal Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act of 2014. Specifically, ADES oversees\n\nArizona\u2019s Rapid Response program. See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 3174(A)(2)(i).\n\n          8.   Arizona\u2019s Rapid Response program is a Workforce Reduction Support service\n\nthat provides prompt layoff transition support and reemployment services to employers and\n\nemployees affected by workplace layoffs and closures in Arizona. Employers and affected\n\nemployees are supported through no-cost, customized services to help mitigate the effects of\n\nworkforce reduction.\n\n\n\n                                                2\n\n\n                                             JA96\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 4-6        Filed 03/07/25      Page 4 of 5\n\n\n\n       9.      I understand on information and belief that, under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d)(3)(A)(i),\n\nthe federal Government is required to notify \u201cthe State or entity designated by the State to carry\n\nout rapid response activities under section 134(a)(2)(A) of the Workforce Investment Act of\n\n1998\u201d of a plan for a reduction-in-force (RIF) of a significant number of federal employees,\n\ngenerally at least 60 days in advance of any proposed RIF.\n\n       10.     To the best of my knowledge ADES has not received notice from the federal\n\ngovernment of a RIF at any federal agency that would trigger the Arizona Rapid Response\n\nprogram.\n\n       11.     At this time, ADES does not know how many federal employees who may be\n\npermitted to file for unemployment benefits in Arizona have been terminated from their\n\nemployment since January 20, 2025.\n\n               Executed on March 5, 2025, in Maricopa County, Arizona.\n\n\n\n\n                                              /s/ Anna Hunter*\n                                              Anna Hunter, Assistant Director,\n                                              Division of Employment and Rehabilitation\n                                              Services, Arizona Department of Economic\n                                              Security\n\n                                              *A copy of the signature page bearing an\n                                              original signature is attached hereto.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 3\n\n\n                                              JA97\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB   Document 4-6   Filed 03/07/25   Page 5 of 5\n\n\n\n\n                             JA98\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB   Document 4-7   Filed 03/07/25   Page 1 of 11\n\n\n\n\n                  Exhibit '\n\n\n\n\n                              JA99\n\f    Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB      Document 4-7   Filed 03/07/25       Page 2 of 11\n\n\n\n\n                         UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n                         FOR THE DISTRICT OF MARYLAND\n\n\n\nSTATE OF MARYLAND; ET AL.,\n\n           Plaintiffs,\n\n     v.

I am a resident of the State of Illinois. I am over the age of 18 and have personal\n\nknowledge of all the facts stated herein, except to those matters stated upon information and\n\nbelief; as to those matters, I believe them to be true. If called as a witness, I could and would\n\ntestify competently to the matters set forth below.\n\n       2.      I am currently employed as the Deputy Director, Service Delivery of the Illinois\n\nDepartment of Employment Security (\u201cIDES\u201d).\n\n\n\n\n                                                  1\n\n\n                                              JA111\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 4-8        Filed 03/07/25       Page 3 of 9\n\n\n\n       3.      IDES is the department of the Illinois state government that administers state\n\nunemployment insurance benefits, runs the employment service and Illinois labor exchange\n\nsystem, and publishes labor market information.\n\n       4.      As IDES Deputy Director, Service Delivery, I have access to comprehensive\n\nreports and financial records that detail the State of Illinois\u2019 labor market, including claims for\n\nunemployment insurance benefits, and the allocation and distribution of federal funding received\n\nby IDES. Additionally, my role includes overseeing the implementation of and compliance with\n\nfederally funded programs within the agency, ensuring expenditures align with federal guidelines\n\nand regulations.\n\n       5.      The ongoing mass-layoff of federal workers is irreparably harming the State of\n\nIllinois in several ways.\n\nUnemployment Assistance Process\n\n       6.      IDES manages claims for unemployment insurance benefits by individuals\n\nformerly employed to work in the State of Illinois.\n\n       7.      The Illinois Unemployment Insurance Act (\u201cUI Act\u201d), 820 ILCS 405/100, et seq.,\n\nprovides unemployment insurance benefits, over an extended period of time, to persons who\n\nbecome unemployed through no fault of their own and meet eligibility requirements. Benefits are\n\nfunded through contributions made by Illinois employers to the Illinois Unemployment\n\nInsurance Trust Fund (\u201cTrust Fund\u201d). Id.\n\n       8.      As a general matter, the federal government is required to pay for unemployment\n\ninsurance benefits provided to former federal employees. Specifically, the State of Illinois is\n\nparty to an agreement with the United States Secretary of Labor, under which the Secretary shall\n\n\n\n\n                                                  2\n\n\n                                              JA112\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 4-8        Filed 03/07/25      Page 4 of 9\n\n\n\npay, as an agent of the United States, Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees\n\n(\u201cUCFE\u201d) pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8502(a).\n\n       9.      Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8502(b), UCFE payments to federal employees are to be\n\nmade in the same amount, on the same terms, and subject to the same conditions as would apply\n\nto them under the UI Act.\n\n       10.     For unemployment insurance claims in general, an individual who wishes to\n\ncollect benefits in Illinois must file a claim in accordance with the requirements of the UI Act\n\nand 56 Ill. Admin Code \u00a7 2712 through \u00a7 2920, generally. See 820 ILCS 405/700. Claimants\n\nmay file claims online using the IDES system to initiate a claim and to provide information\n\nindicating the basis of the claim, the name of the claimant\u2019s previous employer, the reason for\n\nthe job separation, work experience, and other relevant information. Notice of the claim is then\n\ntransmitted to the claimant\u2019s former employer(s) for a response. The employer is asked to furnish\n\ninformation about the separation from employment and other information the employer wishes to\n\nprovide.\n\n       11.     Illinois law disqualifies some claimants from unemployment insurance benefits\n\ndepending on the circumstances of their separation from employment. Disqualifying\n\ncircumstances include, inter alia, discharge for misconduct and voluntary leaving, as defined by\n\nthe UI Act. See 820 ILCS 405/601 and 602.\n\n       12.     If an eligibility determination involves a resolution of a dispute of material fact,\n\nthe claims adjudicator must conduct a predetermination fact-finding interview(s) after notice is\n\nprovided to the employee and her employer(s). 820 ILCS 405/702; 56 Ill. Admin Code\n\n\u00a7 2720.135. Thereafter, a written initial determination must be made stating, inter alia, the\n\nweekly benefit amount, maximum benefits payable to the claimant in a benefit year, and the\n\n\n\n                                                 3\n\n\n                                              JA113\n\f          Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB       Document 4-8        Filed 03/07/25      Page 5 of 9\n\n\n\nreasons for the determination. 820 ILCS 405/702. That determination must be delivered to the\n\nclaimant and the employer \u201cpromptly.\u201d Id. If the initial determination is favorable to the\n\nclaimant, payments must begin \u201cpromptly.\u201d 820 ILCS 405/706.\n\n          13.   A claimant or an employer may file an administrative appeal, generally within 30\n\ndays. 820 ILCS 405/800.\n\n          14.   The unemployment insurance benefit amount a specific individual receives is\n\ngenerally based on their prior wages. Illinois businesses are required to report wages to the\n\nDepartment on a monthly and/or quarterly basis. 820 ILCS 405/1402. However, the federal\n\ngovernment is not required to and does not report wages to the Department. As a result, for each\n\nclaim that is filed by a former federal employee, staff must manually process the claim in order\n\nfor the appropriate federal agency or agencies that employed the claimant to send the wage\n\nreport to IDES.\n\nUnemployment Benefits Recent Experience and Investigatory Process\n\n          15.   IDES\u2019 data indicates that approximately 446 claims for unemployment insurance\n\nbenefits have been filed by former federal employees in Illinois between January 19, 2025 and\n\nMarch 1, 2025 where the last date worked was after January 18, 2025.\n\n          16.   During the entire calendar year of 2024, IDES data indicates that approximately\n\n453 claims were filed by former federal employees for unemployment insurance benefits.\n\n          17.   Each claim filed by a federal employee requires manual processing to obtain the\n\nwage records for that employee, work that is not required in regular unemployment insurance\n\nclaims.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 4\n\n\n                                             JA114\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 4-8        Filed 03/07/25      Page 6 of 9\n\n\n\n       18.     In addition, when an employer responds to a notice of claim to IDES, the\n\nemployer indicates the reason for the separation, including whether the employee was discharged\n\nfor cause, such as misconduct.\n\n       19.     If an employer indicates in its response that an individual was separated due to\n\nperformance issues, unspecified discharge, or voluntarily leaving, IDES procedures require that\n\nthe claims adjudicator investigate the reason for separation.\n\n       20.     Between February 2, 2025, and February 28, 2025, a substantial number of the\n\nresponses from federal employers have indicated a performance issue, unspecified discharge, or\n\nvoluntarily leaving.\n\n       21.     As soon as we receive such a response, the Department is required to follow our\n\nintensive and mandatory investigative process, in addition to seeking wages from the federal\n\nemploying agency as stated above. And while designed to ensure fairness, the procedures impose\n\na significant strain on IDES\u2019 financial and temporal resources. Each case requiring a fact-finding\n\nproceeding necessitates extensive staff hours for scheduling, conducting interviews, reviewing\n\nevidence, and drafting detailed decisions. The need to send notices and accommodate witness\n\ntestimony further escalates the time commitment. Moreover, the potential for subsequent appeals\n\ntriggers a cascade of additional hearings and reviews. All of these activities divert resources\n\nfrom other essential departmental functions.\n\n       22.     The same IDES staff who handle regular unemployment insurance claims also\n\nprocess and adjudicate UCFE claims.\n\n       23.     The cumulative effect of these increased claims by federal workers and increased\n\ninvestigations is translating into substantial expenditures on personnel, administrative overhead,\n\nand the technological infrastructure required to manage the burgeoning caseload, ultimately\n\n\n\n                                                 5\n\n\n                                               JA115\n\f          Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB        Document 4-8        Filed 03/07/25     Page 7 of 9\n\n\n\ndepleting the department\u2019s budget and hindering its ability to address other critical labor-related\n\nissues.\n\n          24.   As the trends noted above continue, the diversion of personnel to handle UCFE\n\nclaims will impede the timely processing of regular unemployment insurance claims, creating\n\nbacklogs and delays. The consequences will be far-reaching, affecting countless individuals who\n\ndepend on swift resolutions to sustain their livelihoods. By diverting resources, we compromise\n\nthe efficiency and responsiveness of our claims processing system, ultimately exacerbating\n\neconomic hardship for Illinoisans and undermining public trust.\n\n          25.   Statements by the President and other federal officials have indicated that the\n\noverwhelming majority of recent federal terminations were not for-cause firings, based on\n\nindividualized assessments of performance, but instead constitute a government-wide effort to\n\nshrink the size of the federal workforce; effectively, a reduction in force.\n\n          26.   As a result, IDES anticipates that the overwhelming majority of recently-\n\nterminated federal employees will be eligible for state unemployment benefits because they were\n\nnot terminated for cause and lost their jobs through no fault of their own.\n\n          27.   However, the federal government\u2019s pretextual claims that terminations are for-\n\ncause or voluntary leaving will necessitate extensive and unrecoverable expenditures of\n\nresources by IDES.\n\nExpenditures Due to Federal Firings\n\n          28.   IDES has another statutory mission to: reduce reliance on public benefit systems\n\nsuch as unemployment insurance benefits; promote economic recovery and vitality by\n\ndeveloping an ongoing, comprehensive approach to identify, plan for, and respond to layoffs and\n\ndislocations; and prevent or minimize the impact of mass layoffs on workers, businesses, and\n\n\n\n                                                  6\n\n\n                                              JA116\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 4-8       Filed 03/07/25      Page 8 of 9\n\n\n\ncommunities. In direct and sole response to the federal firings and the increase in claims filed by\n\nformer federal employees, IDES is expending increased resources to fulfill this responsibility.\n\n       29.     To the best of IDES\u2019 knowledge, there has never been advance notice of which\n\nfederal agencies are planning to conduct mass layoffs, or when. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d)(3)(A).\n\nAccordingly, we have been forced to rely on public reporting and word-of-mouth to conduct\n\nafter-the-fact outreach to potentially affected workers.\n\n       30.     Due to the increase in claims for UCFE benefits, and due to public reporting\n\nabout ongoing and forthcoming federal layoffs, IDES staff around the entire State of Illinois\n\nwere engaged to: develop a rapid plan of action; set up a specialized force of claims adjudicators\n\nand other staff to address and investigate the increased UCFE claims; create direct IVR call\n\ncenter queues for UCFE claimants; develop communications to federal employee claimants\n\nbased on the unique circumstances of this mass firing; develop and present virtual weekly\n\nworkshops for this distinctive group of individuals; and coordinate with other Illinois agencies to\n\nmeet the specialized needs of these individuals.\n\n       31.     Instead of performing their normal duties, staff have instead been dedicated to\n\nreacting to the latest layoff news, trying to identify affected federal agencies and ex-employees,\n\nprovide information, and otherwise adjust procedures and resources to assist confused and\n\nunemployed workers in Illinois in a complicated and rapidly evolving environment.\n\n       32.     As just one example of these efforts, Department staff created a new webpage,\n\nrequiring significant time and expense. See https://ides.illinois.gov/unemployment/deferred-\n\nresignation-of-federal-employees.html. This effort was a further attempt to provide resources and\n\nservices, which could normally be targeted at specific personnel impacted in future layoff events\n\nbut must instead be provided less efficiently and at greater expense to the entire public, because\n\n\n\n                                                   7\n\n\n                                              JA117\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB   Document 4-8   Filed 03/07/25   Page 9 of 9\n\n\n\n\n                             JA118\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB   Document 4-9   Filed 03/07/25   Page 1 of 12\n\n\n\n\n                  Exhibit )\n\n\n\n\n                             JA119\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB         Document 4-9       Filed 03/07/25      Page 2 of 12\n\n\n\n                           UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n                           FOR THE DISTRICT OF MARYLAND\n\n\n\n\n                                                        C.A.

In addition, EOLWD is the secretariat\n\n\n\n\n                                            JA120\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB         Document 4-9       Filed 03/07/25      Page 3 of 12\n\n\n\n\ncomprising the Department of Unemployment Assistance (DUA), MassHire Department of\n\nCareer Services (MDCS), Department of Economic Research (DER), Department of Family and\n\nMedical Leave (DFML), Department of Industrial Accidents, Department of Labor Standards,\n\nDepartment of Labor Relations, and Department of Apprentice Standards. DUA administers the\n\nCommonwealth\u2019s unemployment insurance (\u201cUI\u201d) program, MDCS oversees the state\u2019s career\n\ncenters and related services, and DER supports economic research efforts\u2014including Labor\n\nMarket Information (LMI).\n\n       4.      As Undersecretary/Chief Operating Officer, I oversee the DUA. As a result, I\n\nhave access to comprehensive reports and records that detail the Commonwealth\u2019s LMI,\n\nincluding aggregate data regarding unemployment insurance claims. Additionally, my role\n\nincludes oversight of the DFML, EOLWD\u2019s Information Technology (IT) systems, audit and\n\ncompliance management, and other operations. I work collaboratively with EOLWD\u2019s\n\ndepartments, including the finance department, which disburses UI benefits on behalf of the\n\nDUA.\n\n       5.      The ongoing mass-layoff of federal workers is irreparably harming Massachusetts\n\nin several ways.\n\nRapid Response Team Expenditures\n\n       6.      In Massachusetts, services are provided to workers, jobseekers, and\n\nunemployment insurance claimants in accordance with federal and state laws and requirements,\n\nincluding the federal Workforce Investment Act of 1998, as amended by the federal Workforce\n\nInnovation and Opportunity Act of 2014. A state rapid response program is required by the\n\nfederal Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 3174(A)(2)(i).\n\n\n\n\n                                               2\n\n                                            JA121\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB            Document 4-9       Filed 03/07/25      Page 4 of 12\n\n\n\n\n        7.       The MDCS oversees Massachusetts\u2019s network of Career Centers and provides\n\ncareer services and training opportunities across the state. This includes aiding businesses in\n\nfinding qualified talent, offering career services and referrals to jobseekers, and overseeing the\n\nstate\u2019s Rapid Response program.\n\n        8.       At its core, Rapid Response is an early intervention service provided at no cost to\n\nbusinesses and employees experiencing layoffs, downturns, or growth challenges in\n\nMassachusetts.\n\n        9.       As relevant here, when a private employer with more than 100 employees\n\ncontemplates a mass layoff, terminating 50 or more employees, the federal Worker Adjustment\n\nand Retraining Notification (WARN) Act imposes critical notice requirements. Specifically, the\n\nemployer is required to notify certain groups, including State dislocated worker units, at least\n\nsixty days in advance of the layoffs, so that rapid response activities can be undertaken to\n\nameliorate the negative effects of large unemployment events. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2101 et seq.\n\n        10.      The purpose of Rapid Response is to reduce reliance on public benefit systems\n\nsuch as unemployment insurance; promote economic recovery and vitality by developing an\n\nongoing, comprehensive approach to identify, plan for, and respond to layoffs and dislocations;\n\nand prevent or minimize the impact of mass layoffs on workers, businesses, and communities.\n\n        11.    When notified of a forthcoming mass layoff, the Rapid Response team quickly\n\nmobilizes to provide informational resources and reemployment services for workers, including\n\nbut not limited to: information and support for filing UI claims, information on the impacts of\n\nlayoffs on health coverage or other benefits, information on and referral to career services,\n\nreemployment-focused workshops and services, and referrals to occupational training.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  3\n\n                                               JA122\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 4-9        Filed 03/07/25      Page 5 of 12\n\n\n\n\n        12.     In addition, the Rapid Response team will contact affected businesses to collect,\n\nverify, and distribute pertinent information. Rapid Response will coordinate with state and local\n\nworkforce area staff at the American Job Centers, also called MassHire Career Centers, located\n\nacross the state.\n\n        13.     The Rapid Response team also facilitates connections to partner agencies and\n\norganizations to ensure that terminated workers and their families can continue to access\n\nresources such as home heating assistance, legal aid, and financial advice.\n\n        14.     I understand that, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d)(3)(A)(i), the federal government\n\nis similarly required to notify Massachusetts, or \u201cthe State or entity designated by the State to\n\ncany out rapid response activities under section 134(a)(2)(A) of the Workforce Investment Act\n\nof 1998\u201d of a plan for a reduction-in-force (RIF) of federal employees, generally at least 60 days\n\nin advance of any proposed RIF.\n\n        15.     To the best of my knowledge, neither EOLWD, including its constituent agencies,\n\nnor any other entity in the Massachusetts state government has yet received a notice of a federal\n\nreduction in force at any federal agency.\n\n        16.     Yet, as detailed further below, Massachusetts has already received approximately\n\n251 claims from terminated federal employees for unemployment benefits in Februaiy of 2025.\n\n        17.     DUA has also seen a significant uptick of new unemployment claims from ex-\n\nfederal employees just in the last few weeks, with 32 claims filed on February 24 alone. DUA is\n\nseeing and expects to continue seeing new claims filed every day.\n\n       18.     Due to these increasing claims for unemployment benefits, and due to public\n\nreporting about ongoing and forthcoming federal layoffs, our Rapid Response team personnel\n\nhave proactively contacted dozens of federal agencies and offices to ensure accurate information\n\n\n\n                                                 4\n\n                                              JA123\n\f        Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 4-9        Filed 03/07/25       Page 6 of 12\n\n\n\n\nis being provided and to seek information as to whether mass layoffs are being conducted\n\ncurrently or are being planned in the future. Similarly, the MDCS Rapid Response team has\n\nbeen fielding calls and meeting requests from concerned federal agencies, their representatives,\n\nand others. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, U.S. Department of Labor, the\n\nU.S. Department of the Interior, the U.S. Department of Treasury, the U.S. Department of\n\nVeterans Affairs, and others, all of whom have a significant presence in Massachusetts, have\n\nraised concerns regarding layoffs.\n\n        19.     The Rapid Response team has not received any substantive information as to\n\nthese federal agencies\u2019 plans for mass layoffs.\n\n        20.     Because our Rapid Response team has received no notice of federal RIFs, despite\n\nextensive outreach, EOLWD has been required to dedicate significantly more staff, resources,\n\nand expenditures to fulfill its statutory mission.\n\n        21.     Indeed, because EOLWD and its constituent agencies have not received advance\n\nnotice of which agencies are planning to conduct mass layoffs, we have been forced to rely on\n\npublic reporting and word-of-mouth to conduct after-the-fact outreach to potentially impacted\n\nindividuals. Reacting after a layoff is far more resource-intensive than the advance planning and\n\nassistance process required by law.\n\n       22.     This approach has ensured that those impacted by the layoffs have access to\n\ncrucial information and assistance. However, the extensive work required to implement these\n\ninitiatives has strained the departments' resources, while still trying to maintain effective levels\n\nof support in the face of ongoing challenges.\n\n\n\n\n                                                     5\n\n                                                JA124\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 4-9        Filed 03/07/25      Page 7 of 12\n\n\n\n\n           23.   For instance, as referenced above, staff have conducted extensive proactive\n\noutreach to federal agencies and offices to try to determine the location and extent of upcoming\n\nlayoffs.\n\n           24.   Moreover, EOLWD and its constituent agencies have had to devote significant\n\nadditional staff time from communications, policy, and legal staff to field questions from\n\nconcerned stakeholders and legislators, conduct broad-based outreach to try and identify\n\nrecently-terminated employees, and provide relevant resources and services.\n\n           25.   Under normal circumstances, such personnel are engaged in creating guidance for\n\nstakeholders and general media strategy around connecting Massachusetts residents to jobs,\n\ngrowing apprenticeship programs, program and grant administration, and other efforts to help\n\ngrow and support Massachusetts employers, workers, jobseekers, and more broadly the\n\nMassachusetts economy.\n\n       26.       However, such staff have instead been dedicated to reacting to the latest layoff\n\nnews, developing resource guides and fact sheets, trying to identify affected federal agencies and\n\nex-employees, provide information, and otherwise adjust procedures and resources to assist\n\nconfused and recently unemployed Massachusetts residents in a complicated and rapidly\n\nevolving environment.\n\n       27.       Since February 3, 2025, this has included reallocation of work for approximately\n\nseven MDCS staff members on the Rapid Response team. Specifically, this has meant diverting\n\nstaff from other important work for a combined total of at least 25 to 30 hours per week over the\n\nlast five weeks. This level of effort is expected to continue\u2014if not increase\u2014across the Rapid\n\nResponse team. Services provided to affected federal employees by the Rapid Response team so\n\nfar in 2025 have included but are not limited to: resume support; one-on-one meetings and career\n\n\n\n                                                  6\n\n                                               JA125\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 4-9       Filed 03/07/25      Page 8 of 12\n\n\n\n\ncounseling; providing information regarding use of LMI and how it can be useful in job search;\n\nand providing information about available resources, including MDCS Career Center services,\n\nand referrals to other internal and external resources.\n\n        28.     In addition to the Rapid Response team staff time already being dedicated to\n\nthese efforts, if work continues at this pace, MDCS staff not currently on the Rapid Response\n\nteam will be diverted from other critical career services programs.\n\n        29.    The Rapid Response team is also responsible for processing WARN notices for\n\nMassachusetts companies affected by layoffs.\n\n        30.    Other EOLWD and MDCS resources have been supporting Rapid Response\n\nefforts, but if federal layoffs continue at their current pace, MDCS resources will need to be\n\ncross-trained to support increased Rapid Response programming, diverting staff from other\n\ncritical career services programs across the state.\n\nUnemployment Assistance Process\n\n       31.     The Massachusetts unemployment insurance program, which is certified by the\n\nU.S. Secretary of Labor under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 502(a) and administered by the Massachusetts\n\nDepartment of Unemployment Assistance, provides for payment of UI benefits for eligible\n\nclaimants in Massachusetts. Specifically, DUA provides temporary payments for up to twenty-\n\nsix weeks to eligible workers who lose their job through no fault of their own, are able and\n\navailable to work, and actively searching for a job while receiving benefits. Such benefits are\n\nadministered pursuant to Chapter 151A of the Massachusetts General Laws.\n\n       32.     As a general matter, the federal government is required to reimburse\n\nMassachusetts for unemployment benefits provided to former federal employees. Specifically,\n\nMassachusetts is party to an agreement with the U.S. Secretary of Labor, wherein the Secretary\n\n\n\n                                                  7\n\n                                               JA126\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB            Document 4-9       Filed 03/07/25      Page 9 of 12\n\n\n\n\nshall pay, as an agent of the United States, Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees\n\n(\u201cUCFE\u201d) pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8502(a).\n\n       33.       Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8502(b), Massachusetts is reimbursed for UCFE payments\n\nto federal employees in the same amount, on the same terms, and subject to the same conditions\n\nwhich would be payable to them under Chapter 151A of the Massachusetts General Laws.\n\n       34.       In addition, DUA administers its federal-state cooperative unemployment\n\ninsurance program financed in large part by federal administrative grants pursuant to the Social\n\nSecurity Act. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 501-503.\n\n       35.       An individual in Massachusetts who wishes to collect UI benefits must file a\n\nclaim in accordance with DUA\u2019s statutory and regulatory requirements.\n\n       36.       Claimants file claims using DUA\u2019s online UI system to establish a claim initially\n\nand to provide information to indicate the basis of the claim, the reason for separation from\n\nemployment, the name of the employer, work experience, and other relevant information. G.L.\n\nc. 151A, \u00a7 38.\n\n       37.       The reason for termination alleged by the claimant is transmitted to the claimant\u2019s\n\nemployer for verification. The employer is asked to furnish a report of the separation from\n\nemployment containing, inter alia, the reason for the employee\u2019s separation and a report of wage\n\nhistory. G.L. c. 151 A, \u00a7\u00a7 38, 38A.\n\n       38.       Massachusetts law disqualifies some claimants from benefits depending on the\n\ncircumstances of their separation from employment or their failure to comply with state\n\nrequirements, for example, to continue to seek suitable employment while collecting\n\nunemployment insurance benefits. See G.L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 25. In addition to failing to comply with\n\n\n\n\n                                                  8\n\n                                               JA127\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 4-9        Filed 03/07/25          Page 10 of 12\n\n\n\n\ntechnical filing and registration requirements, disqualifying circumstances include termination\n\nfor deliberate misconduct in willful disregard of the employer\u2019s interest. Id.\n\n        39.      DUA adjudicators are charged with making initial determinations on claims. G.L.\n\nc. 151A, \u00a7 39.\n\n        40.      A claimant or an employer who disputes a determination on a UI claim may file\n\nan appeal within ten calendar days of notification. Following such an appeal, a hearing is held\n\nby a DUA review examiner. For a second level of review, appeals may be made to the Board of\n\nReview within thirty days of the mailing of a hearing decision. The three-member Board of\n\nReview is administered independently of the DUA and has the authority to uphold, reverse, or\n\nmodify, a review examiner\u2019s decision. Parties may appeal decisions by the Board of Review to a\n\nMassachusetts District Court or Boston Municipal Court within thirty days of the mailing of the\n\nBoard\u2019s decision. G.L. c. 151 A.\n\nUnemployment Benefits Recent Experience and Investigatory Process\n\n       41.       EOLWD\u2019s latest data indicates that 251 former federal employees have applied\n\nfor unemployment benefits since January 21, 2025.\n\n       42.       This data also shows that 86 of these individuals were formerly employed by the\n\nU.S. Department of Treasury, 26 by the U.S. Department of the Interior, 22 by the U.S.\n\nDepartment of Transportation, 21 by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and 18 by the U.S.\n\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs. To-date, in February alone, former employees from thirty-five\n\nfederal agencies or entities have filed to collect UI benefits in Massachusetts.\n\n       43.       The number of UCFE claims in Massachusetts has increased significantly,\n\nbeginning on or around February 9, 2025.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 9\n\n                                              JA128\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB            Document 4-9        Filed 03/07/25     Page 11 of 12\n\n\n\n\n        44.     In fact, the number of federal unemployment claims and inquiries received by the\n\nDUA in February of 2025 is significantly higher than past years.\n\n        45.     By way of example, in February 2024, DUA received 58 total federal UI claims.\n\nSo far, in February 2025, DUA has received 251. The total volume of claims for February 2025\n\nis expected to be higher still because eligible claimants can still file UI claims with a separation\n\ndate in February.\n\n        46.     Claimants must indicate the reason for their separation from employment in their\n\nUI applications. In Massachusetts, many recently separated federal workers are reporting either\n\nlack of work (due to a reorganization or restructure) or discharge for job performance (if\n\nperformance is cited in the dismissal as the reason for separation). Under Massachusetts law,\n\npoor job performance alone does not automatically disqualify someone from benefits. See G. L.\n\nc. 151A, \u00a7 25(e)(2).\n\n        47.     When an employer replies to DUA fact-finding with information related to a\n\nseparation, the employer is asked to provide the reason for the separation, including whether the\n\nemployee was fired for cause, such as deliberate misconduct in willful disregard of the\n\nemployer\u2019s interest.\n\n        48.     Every eligibility determination at the DUA is made on a case-by-case basis.\n\nWhen there is a dispute of material fact between the employer and the claimant, such as whether\n\na termination was for cause, an adjudicator sends a written notice notifying the parties of fact-\n\nfinding and conducting a proceeding in which the parties can offer evidence. Thereafter, the\n\nadjudicator drafts a written decision and delivers it to the parties.\n\n        49.     Each case demanding a fact-finding proceeding necessitates extensive staff hours\n\nfor scheduling, conducting interviews, reviewing evidence, and drafting detailed decisions. The\n\n\n\n                                                  10\n\n                                                JA129\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 4-9        Filed 03/07/25     Page 12 of 12\n\n\n\n\nneed to send notices, accommodate witness testimony, and facilitate cross-examination further\n\nescalates the time commitment.\n\n        50.    The cumulative effect translates to substantial expenditures on personnel,\n\nadministrative overhead, and technological infrastructure, at a time when DUA is preparing to\n\nlaunch a new online unemployment system.\n\n        51.    From that point, either party may initiate the administrative appeals process\n\ndescribed above.\n\n       52.     Recent statements of the President and other federal officials have indicated that\n\nthe overwhelming majority of recent federal terminations were not for-cause firings, based on\n\nindividualized assessments of performance, but instead constitute a government-wide effort to\n\nshrink the size of the federal workforce, an effective reduction in force.\n\n       53.     As a result, it is likely that the overwhelming majority of recently-terminated\n\nfederal employees will in fact be eligible for state unemployment benefits, because they were not\n\nterminated for cause.\n\n       54.     However, the federal government\u2019s claim that such terminations are for-cause will\n\nnecessitate extensive investigatory costs and resource expenditures by EOLWD.\n\n\n\n               Executed on March 5, 2025, at Boston, Massachusetts.\n\n\n\n\n                                                aolo Franzese, Esq.\n                                              Pa<\n                                                ndersecretary & Chief Operating Officer\n\n\n\n\n                                                 11\n\n                                              JA130\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB   Document 4-10   Filed 03/07/25   Page 1 of 7\n\n\n\n\n                  Exhibit *\n\n\n\n\n                             JA131\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 4-10        Filed 03/07/25      Page 2 of 7\n\n\n\n\n                       IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n                           FOR THE DISTRICT OF MARYLAND\n\n\n STATE OF MARYLAND, et al.,\n                               Plaintiffs,\n\n                                                   No.\n\n U.S. DEPT.

Background\n\n       1.      I am the Secretary for the Massachusetts Executive Office of Health and Human\n\nServices (\"EOHHS\"). I have held this position since March 1, 2023. As the Secretary ofEOHHS,\n\nI oversee 11 state agencies, which include the Department of Public Health (\"DPH\") and the\n\nDepartment of Transitional Assistance (\"OTA\"). EOHHS also serves as the single state agency\n\nresponsible for the administration of the Medicaid program and the State Children's Health\n\nInsurance Program within Massachusetts (collectively, \"MassHealth\") and other health and human\n\nservices programs designed to pay for medical services for eligible individuals pursuant to M.G.L.\n\nc. 118E, Title XIX of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. sec. 1396 et seq.), Title XXI of the Social\n\nSecurity Act (42 U.S.C. sec. 1397aa et seq.), and other applicable laws and waivers. Our Secretariat\n\nhas an annual operating budget of approximately $30 billion and touches one out of every three\n\nresidents of the Commonwealth.\n\n       2.      I hold a Bachelor of Arts degree and a Master's degree in public health from Yale\n\nUniversity. Before joining the Healey-Driscoll Administration I served as the President and Chief\n\n\n\n\n                                             JA132\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB              Document 4-10   Filed 03/07/25    Page 3 of 7\n\n\n\n\nOperating Officer of Boston Medical Center (\"BMC\") for approximately 13 years. BMC is a\n\nprivate, not-for-profit 496-bed academic medical center in Boston. BMC health system has\n\napproximately 10,000 employees, 1,200 physicians, owns and operates Wellsense Insurance plan\n\nwhich provides access to health care to 600,000 people across Massachusetts and New Hampshire\n\nand an annual operating budget of roughly $6 billion. Prior to my appointment at BMC, I served\n\nas Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of Brigham and Women's Hospital for\n\nfive years.\n\n        3.      As EOHHS Secretary, I have personal knowledge of the rules, regulations, and\n\nprocesses governing EOHHS and its agencies. I have personal knowledge, or knowledge based on\n\nreview in my capacity as Secretary of information and records gathered by EOHHS and agency\n\nstaff, of the matters set forth below.\n\nI.      The Department of Public Health\n\n        4.      DPH promotes and protects health and wellness and prevents injury and illness for\n\n7 million residents of our Commonwealth. DPH prevents illness and disease, gives children a\n\nhealthy start, and makes sure food and water supplies are safe. They prepare for and respond to a\n\nwide range of emergencies and disasters, and they maintain vital records and collect important\n\nhealth-recorded data across the state. DPH also assesses the quality and safety of health care\n\nfacilities and services and oversees the integrity and competency of health care professions. DPH\n\nis the state agency responsible for overseeing the statewide system of prevention, intervention,\n\ntreatment, recovery and support services for individuals and families affected by substance\n\naddiction. In 2023, 2,125 people died as a result of an opioid related overdose in Massachusetts.\n\nOn or about February 28, the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services terminated the\n\nRegion I Regional Director effective immediately and without notice, leaving Massachusetts and\n\nall of New England without a federal regional coordinating body. This gap in staffing increases\n                                                 2\n\n\n\n\n                                             JA133\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB         Document 4-10          Filed 03/07/25   Page 4 of 7\n\n\n\n\nthe risk that harmful changes to drugs prone to abuse may not be timely identified as they travel\n\nthroughout New England. For example, in 2023, comprehensive communication with the\n\nRegional Director allowed programs throughout Massachusetts to understand and address the\n\npresence of a new adulterant, nitazene. Information received through public health partners in\n\nVermont and the Massachusetts Drug Supply Data Stream (\"MADDS\"), and managed by the\n\nRegional Director, enabled Massachusetts harm reduction providers to recognize clinical changes\n\nin presentation that could be attributed to nitazene and to respond accordingly. The sharing of this\n\ninformation allowed providers to collaborate and stay informed about changes in street drug supply\n\navailability, potency, and new drug-related health risks.\n\nII.    The Department of Transitional Assistance - SNAP\n\n       5.      The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (\"SNAP\") provides financial\n\nassistance to low-income individuals and families to help them buy food. Nearly 1.1 million people\n\nin Massachusetts receive SNAP benefits, one in six Massachusetts residents. There are SNAP\n\nrecipients in every city and town across the Commonwealth. Nearly 25% of SNAP recipients are\n\nolder adults (age 60 and older), 28% of SNAP recipients have a disability, and about one-third of\n\nSNAP recipients are children. SNAP eligibility is based on income and expenses. Most households\n\nmust have a gross monthly income at or below 200% of the Federal Poverty Level to qualify for\n\nSNAP in Massachusetts. In Massachusetts, the average SNAP benefit is $330 per household at the\n\nrate of$10.80 per household per day.\n\n       6.      OTA has been working with US Digital Services since February 2024 to develop\n\nand pilot a new technical Consent Based Verification app, which would improve and expand the\n\nability to collect and validate employment information for applying and existing SNAP\n\nhouseholds. Not only would the tool be implemented in Massachusetts, but it was also anticipated\n\n\n\n                                                 3\n\n\n\n\n                                           JA134\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB        Document 4-10        Filed 03/07/25     Page 5 of 7\n\n\n\n\nthat this service would ultimately be made available to all SNAP states, offering reduced\n\nadministrative costs for income verification to both states and the federal government. After a\n\nsuccessful phase one pilot in late 2024, Massachusetts and the USDS team broadened and\n\naccelerated the engagement in anticipation of a full-scale rollout of the technology in early spring\n\n2025. However, over recent weeks this engagement has been seriously disrupted by the\n\ntermination, loss, or relocation of USDS employees working on the project. As a result, the\n\nlikelihood of implementing CBV on time in Massachusetts has changed from expected to unlikely.\n\nIII.     MassHealth Programs\n\n        7.     EOHHS administers several publicly funded programs that enable qualifying\n\nMassachusetts residents to access free or low-cost healthcare coverage. These programs include\n\nthe Medicaid plan, Children's Health Insurance Program (\"CHIP\"), and the 1115 Demonstration\n\nProject-collectively known in Massachusetts as \"MassHealth.\" Jointly funded by state and\n\nfederal dollars, MassHealth provides coverage for a wide range of health services to children, the\n\nelderly, families, and individuals with disabilities. MassHealth benefits may vary depending on,\n\namong other things, a person's citizenship and immigration status and household income.\n\n        8.     Depending on household income, children who are U.S. citizens or who have\n\nqualifying immigration status are eligible for MassHealth's more comprehensive health benefits.\n\nFor example, children whose household income is no more than 200% of the federal poverty level\n\n(for children under 1) or 150% of the federal poverty level (for children 1 through 18) are eligible\n\nfor MassHealth Standard benefits. These MassHealth plans, which are funded in part by federal\n\ndollars, cover comprehensive medical and behavioral health care, primary and specialty physician\n\nservices, inpatient and outpatient hospital services, long-term services and supports,\n\ncomprehensive dental and vision care, lab tests, and pharmacy services.\n\n\n\n                                                 4\n\n\n\n\n                                           JA135\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 4-10       Filed 03/07/25      Page 6 of 7\n\n\n\n\n       9.      The majority of MassHealth's 2.3 million members receive their MassHealth\n\nservices through a managed care delivery system that MassHealth has implemented under federal\n\nregulations promulgated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\"CMS\") at 42 CFR\n\nPart 438. MassHealth's managed care programs include mandatory managed care programs for\n\nindividuals under the age of 65 for whom MassHealth is their primary insurer, as well as two\n\nvoluntary managed care programs for adults and seniors who have dual Medicare and Medicaid\n\nenrollment. As of February 2025, over 1.6 million members were enrolled in a MassHealth\n\nmanaged care program, which include managed care organizations (\"MCOs\"), primary care case\n\nmanagement entities (\"PCCM entities\"), a prepaid inpatient health plan (\"PIHP\"), and primary\n\ncare case managers (\"PCCMs\"), as defined under 42 CFR 438.2. These managed care programs,\n\nauthorized and regulated by CMS, are responsible for ensuring that their 1.6 million MassHealth\n\nenrollees have access to the benefits and entitlements guaranteed under federal law.\n\n       10.     In accordance with CMS regulations and subregulatory requirements, MassHealth\n\nsubmits documents related to its managed care programs to CMS for review and approval. The\n\nmanaged care documents required to be submitted to CMS for review and approval include\n\ncontracts and contract amendments, actuarially developed rate certifications, and state directed\n\npayment \"preprints.\" In calendar year 2024, MassHealth submitted 23 contract amendments, 18\n\nrate certifications or amended rate certifications, and 56 state directed payment preprints or\n\namended preprints for CMS review and approval. In order to gamer the requisite federal approvals\n\non these documents, MassHealth is also required to respond to CMS questions on these\n\ndocuments. In 2024, MassHealth submitted 5 sets of responses to CMS questions on our contract\n\namendments, 20 sets of responses to CMS questions on our rate certifications, and 32 sets of\n\nresponses to CMS questions on our state directed payment preprints. In all, the state submitted\n\n\n\n                                                5\n\n\n\n\n                                           JA136\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB   Document 4-10   Filed 03/07/25   Page 7 of 7\n\n\n\n\n                             JA137\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB   Document 4-11   Filed 03/07/25   Page 1 of 11\n\n\n\n\n                   Exhibit +\n\n\n\n\n                              JA138\n\f    Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 4-11       Filed 03/07/25     Page 2 of 11\n\n\n\n                             UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n                             FOR THE DISTRICT OF MARYLAND\n\n\n\n\nSTATE OF MARYLAND; et al.,\n\n\n               Plaintiffs,\n\n\n      v.                                              Case No.: 1:25-cv-\n\n\nUNITED STATES DERPARTMENT OF\nAGRICULTURE; et al.,\n\n\n               Defendants.\n\n\n\n\n                    DECLARATION OF ROBERT ASARO-ANGELO\n\n     I, Robert Asaro-Angelo, declare as follows:\n\n           1. I am a resident of the State of New Jersey. I am over the age of 18. I am currently\n\n  the Commissioner of the New Jersey State Department of Labor and Workforce Development\n\n  (\u201cNJDOL\u201d).\n\n           2. I provide this declaration regarding certain facts based on my personal knowledge\n\n  and review of information provided to me by NJDOL personnel.\n\n           3. The mission of NJDOL is to protect New Jersey's workforce, strengthen its\n\n  businesses, and promote the dignity of work. NJDOL oversees New Jersey's three wage-\n\n  protection programs (Unemployment, Temporary Disability, and Family Leave Insurance),\n\n\n\n\n                                           JA139\n\f  Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 4-11       Filed 03/07/25      Page 3 of 11\n\n\n\nwhich provide cash benefits to workers who lose their jobs through no fault of their own, or\n\nare unable to work because they are sick or injured, caring for a family member, or bonding\n\nwith a new child. The NJDOL also oversees the Division of Disability Determination Services\n\nprogram, which helps individuals who are disabled and are unable to work apply for cash\n\nbenefits through the federal Social Security Program; oversees and operates the Division of\n\nWorkforce Development, which is responsible for New Jersey's workforce services, including\n\nvocational rehabilitation services, veterans\u2019 services, and more; and oversees the Division of\n\nEmployer Accounts, which helps employers throughout New Jersey maintain compliance with\n\nUnemployment and Disability Insurance laws. Additionally, NJDOL enforces the New Jersey\n\nPublic Employees Occupational Safety and Health Act as an Occupational Safety and Health\n\nAdministration State Plan.\n\n       4. As Commissioner, I have access to comprehensive reports and financial records\n\nthat detail the state of New Jersey\u2019s labor market, including claims for unemployment benefits,\n\nand the allocation and distribution of federal funding received by NJDOL. Additionally, my\n\nrole includes overseeing the implementation of, and compliance with, federally funded\n\nprograms within the agency, ensuring all expenditures align with federal guidelines and\n\nregulations.\n\n       5. The ongoing mass-layoff of federal workers is irreparably harming New Jersey in\n\nseveral ways.\n\n           Rapid Response Team Expenditures\n\n       6. NJDOL oversees the Rapid Response Program, a coordinated, multiple-partner\n\nstrategy to provide immediate assistance to New Jerseyans subject to mass layoffs. NJDOL is\n\nthe state entity responsible for conducting outreach and providing unemployment services\n\n\n\n\n                                        JA140\n\f  Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 4-11         Filed 03/07/25      Page 4 of 11\n\n\n\nrequired by the federal Workforce Investment Act of 1998, as amended by the federal\n\nWorkforce Innovation and Opportunity Act of 2014.\n\n       7. Specifically, a state rapid response program is required by both the federal\n\nWorkforce Innovation and Opportunity Act 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 3174(A)(2)(i) and N.J.S.A. 34:21-5.\n\n       8. When a private employer with more than 100 employees contemplates a mass\n\nlayoff, terminating 50 or more employees, the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining\n\nNotification (WARN) Act imposes critical notice requirements. Specifically, the employer is\n\nrequired to notify certain groups including State dislocated worker units, at least sixty days in\n\nadvance of the layoffs, so that rapid response activities can be undertaken to ameliorate the\n\nnegative effects of large unemployment events. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2101 et seq.\n\n       9. The purpose of the Rapid Response Program is to reduce reliance on public benefit\n\nsystems such as unemployment insurance; to promote economic recovery and vitality by\n\ndeveloping an ongoing, comprehensive approach to identify, plan for, and respond to layoffs\n\nand dislocations; and to prevent or minimize the impact of mass layoffs on workers, businesses,\n\nand communities.\n\n       10. When notified of a forthcoming mass layoff, the Rapid Response team will quickly\n\nprovide informational resources and reemployment services for workers, including but not\n\nlimited to: information and support for filing Unemployment Insurance (UI) claims,\n\ninformation on the impacts of layoffs on health coverage or other benefits, information on and\n\nreferral to career services, reemployment-focused workshops and services, and occupational\n\ntraining. The information is either presented virtually or on site at the discretion of the\n\nemployer.\n\n\n\n\n                                          JA141\n\f  Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 4-11         Filed 03/07/25       Page 5 of 11\n\n\n\n       11. I understand that, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d)(3)(A)(i), the federal Government\n\nis similarly required to notify \u201cthe State or entity designated by the State to carry out rapid\n\nresponse activities under section 134(a)(2)(A) of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998\u201d of a\n\nplan for a reduction-in-force (RIF) of federal employees, generally at least 60 days in advance\n\nof any proposed RIF.\n\n       12. My understanding is that the notice required by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d)(3)(A) is\n\nintended to trigger rapid response activities since it is explicitly to be given to the state entity\n\nrequired to carry out rapid response activities.\n\n       13. To the best of my knowledge, neither the NJDOL nor any other entity in the New\n\nJersey State Government have received notice of a federal reduction in force at any federal\n\nagency.\n\n       14. NJDOL\u2019s data indicates that 388 former federal employees, both probationary and\n\nnon-probationary, have applied for unemployment benefits from January 21, 2025, to February\n\n26, 2025. There was a material increase in the number of such claims beginning in mid-\n\nFebruary.\n\n       15. During the same period in 2024, only 104 federal unemployment claims were filed\n\nwith NJDOL. In the four months preceding the Executive Order, an average of 79 federal\n\nunemployment claims were filed each month.\n\n       16. Due to the lack of notice of these wide-scale federal employee firings, NJDOL\n\nwill have to devote a significant amount of time to conduct broad-based outreach to try to\n\nidentify recently terminated employees, and provide relevant resources and assistance in\n\nprocessing claims.\n\n\n\n\n                                           JA142\n\f  Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 4-11           Filed 03/07/25   Page 6 of 11\n\n\n\n       17. In addition, because of the lack of notice, NJDOL has been unable to plan in\n\nadvance to allocate more staff, resources, and expenditures as needed to fulfill our statutory\n\nmission and address the influx of claims.\n\n       18. In sum, my office needs to devote significant time, resources, and expense to simply\n\ntry to identify workers subject to federal mass layoffs and otherwise make resources available\n\nto potentially affected individuals in new ways, all because federal agencies have failed to\n\nprovide us the legally required notice of mass layoffs.\n\n              Unemployment Assistance Process\n\n       19. NJDOL also manages claims for unemployment benefits by individuals formerly\n\nemployed to work in New Jersey.\n\n       20. The Unemployment Compensation Law of New Jersey provides insurance\n\nbenefits, over an extended period of time, to persons who become unemployed through no fault\n\nof their own. N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 43:21-1\u201324.30.\n\n       21. As a general matter, the federal Government is required to reimburse New Jersey\n\nfor unemployment benefits provided to former federal employees. Specifically, the Division\n\nof Employment Security is party to an agreement with the United States Secretary of Labor,\n\nwherein the Secretary shall pay, as an agent of the United States, Unemployment\n\nCompensation for Federal Employees (\u201cUCFE\u201d) pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8502(a). N.J. Stat.\n\nAnn. \u00a7 43:21-5.2.\n\n       22. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8502(b), New Jersey is reimbursed for UCFE payments to\n\nfederal employees in the same amount, on the same terms, and subject to the same conditions\n\nwhich would be payable to them under the New Jersey Unemployment Compensation Law.\n\n\n\n\n                                         JA143\n\f  Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 4-11         Filed 03/07/25      Page 7 of 11\n\n\n\n       23. Pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 43:21-6, an individual in New Jersey who wishes to\n\ncollect unemployment insurance benefits must file a claim in accordance with regulations\n\nadopted by the Director of the Division of Unemployment and Temporary Disability Insurance\n\nof the Department of Labor and Workforce Development of the State of New Jersey.\n\n       24. Claimants file claims online or by phone using NJDOL\u2019s system to assert a claim\n\ninitially and to provide information to indicate the basis of the claim, the name of the claimant\u2019s\n\nprevious employer, the reason for her separation, work experience, and other relevant\n\ninformation. The claimant is then provided a notice from the Division informing them that the\n\nclaim is being processed as well as their expected monetary determination, if wage information\n\nis available to the Division.\n\n       25. The employer is then contacted and asked to furnish a report of the separation from\n\nemployment containing the reason for the employee\u2019s separation and, if not already available\n\nto the Division, a report of wage history. N.J. Admin. Code \u00a7 12:17-5.5; see also N.J. Admin.\n\nCode \u00a7 12:17-3.2.\n\n       26. New Jersey law disqualifies or delays some claimants from receiving benefits\n\ndepending on the circumstances of their separation from employment or other factors. See N.J.\n\nStat. Ann. \u00a7 43:21-5. Disqualifying or delaying circumstances include, inter alia, termination\n\nfor misconduct, which if confirmed after investigation by NJDOL results in a six-week waiting\n\nperiod before receiving benefits. Id., see also N.J. Admin. Code \u00a7\u00a7 12:17-10.1\u201310.8.\n\n       27. After a claimant has filed a claim, the claimant may be required to participate in\n\nfact-finding and electronic adjudication to determine eligibility for benefits. N.J. Admin. Code\n\n\u00a7 12:17-4.3(g). Thereafter, a benefit determination notice will be made stating, inter alia, the\n\n\n\n\n                                          JA144\n\f  Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 4-11        Filed 03/07/25      Page 8 of 11\n\n\n\ninformation used to determine monetary eligibility and if he or she is found ineligible or\n\ndisqualified for benefits. N.J. Admin. Code \u00a7 12:17-4.7.\n\n       28. A claimant may file an appeal within 21 days from the mailing date of the benefit\n\ndetermination notice. An employer may file for appeal within 7 days of confirmed receipt of\n\nnotification of an initial determination. N.J. Stat. Ann \u00a7 43:21-6(b)(1). An initial determination\n\nis final unless an appeal is filed, and such appeals may proceed through administrative and\n\nthen judicial review. N.J. Admin. Code \u00a7\u00a7 1:12-1\u201318.5.\n\n           Unemployment Benefits Recent Experience and Investigatory Process\n\n       29. As noted above, there has been a significant increase in unemployment claims for\n\nformer federal employees received by NJDOL since January 20, 2025 and in particular since\n\nmid-February.\n\n       30. Private sector employers are required to file quarterly wage information via WR-\n\n30 and NJ-927s with NJDOL. However, federal public sector employers are not required to\n\nprovide such wage information.\n\n       31. For claims submitted by federal public sector employees, including every UCFE\n\nclaim, NJDOL must reach out to the employer to determine wage information and the\n\nemployer\u2019s reasons for the dismissal. The federal employer then has 10 days to respond to the\n\nrequest. Only when the information is received can the benefit amount calculation proceed. If\n\nthe information is not received, additional outreach to the claimant is required to obtain pay\n\nstubs and other wage verifying information. As a result, NJDOL must expend more time and\n\nresources to process UCFE claims than regular UI claims.\n\n       32. Furthermore, if there is a dispute between the employer and employee as to the\n\nreason for the termination, or if any reason is provided for the separation other than an\n\n\n\n\n                                          JA145\n\f  Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB            Document 4-11      Filed 03/07/25     Page 9 of 11\n\n\n\nagreement of lack of work between the employer and claimant, NJDOL\u2019s procedures require\n\nthat the claims examiner investigate the reason for discharge.\n\n       33. I understand from public reporting that many probationary workers were notified\n\nthat they were being terminated for performance. I therefore anticipate that at least some\n\nfederal agencies will maintain the position that the terminated probationary employees were\n\nfired due to poor performance.\n\n       34. NJDOL thus expects that it will have to follow our intensive investigative process\n\nto investigate the reasons for the firings of many probationary employees. While designed to\n\nensure fairness, the procedures impose a significant strain on NJDOL\u2019s financial and temporal\n\nresources. Each case demands a fact-finding proceeding and necessitates extensive staff hours\n\nfor scheduling, conducting phone interviews, reviewing evidence, and drafting detailed\n\ndecisions. The need to send notices, accommodate witness testimony, and facilitate cross-\n\nexamination further escalates the time commitment. Moreover, the potential for subsequent\n\nappeals triggers a cascade of additional hearings and reviews, diverting resources from other\n\nessential departmental functions.\n\n       35. The cumulative effect of these investigations translates to substantial expenditures\n\non personnel, administrative overhead, and the technological infrastructure required to manage\n\nthe burgeoning caseload, ultimately impacting NJDOL\u2019s budget and hindering its ability to\n\naddress other critical labor-related issues.\n\n       36. The same Department staff who handle regular unemployment claims also process\n\nand adjudicate UCFE claims. Redirecting staff from handling regular Unemployment\n\nInsurance (UI) claims to process and adjudicate this sudden influx of resource-intensive UCFE\n\nclaims threatens to strain our resources.\n\n\n\n\n                                            JA146\n\f Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 4-11        Filed 03/07/25      Page 10 of 11\n\n\n\n       37. This diversion of personnel will undoubtedly impede the timely processing of\n\nregular UI claims, creating backlogs and delays. The consequences will be far-reaching,\n\naffecting countless individuals who depend on swift resolutions to sustain their livelihoods.\n\n       38. Recent statements of the President and other federal officials have indicated that\n\nthe overwhelming majority of recent federal terminations were not for-cause firings, based on\n\nindividualized assessments of performance, but instead constitute a Government-wide effort\n\nto shrink the size of the federal workforce, an effective reduction in force.\n\n       39. As a result, it is likely that the overwhelming majority of recently-terminated\n\nfederal employees will in fact be eligible for state unemployment benefits, because they were\n\nnot terminated for cause.\n\n       40. However, statements in termination letters provided to probationary employees\n\nstate such terminations are for-cause and will necessitate extensive and irreparable\n\ninvestigatory costs and resource expenditures by NJDOL.\n\n           Increased Unemployment Benefits\n\n       41. Finally, New Jersey will also bear increased costs in the form of unemployment\n\nbenefits of ex-federal employees. While the federal government is generally required to\n\nreimburse New Jersey for UCFE benefits, New Jersey must pay such benefits in the first\n\ninstance, depleting the statewide trust fund that is supported by private employers in the state.\n\n       42. Moreover, the U.S. Secretary of Labor has discretion to reimburse states for\n\nadministrative costs required to conduct the state unemployment compensation program. 42\n\nU.S.C. \u00a7 502(a). While New Jersey has been and continues to expend additional resources\n\nnecessary to address the uptick in federal unemployment claims, it is thus entirely speculative\n\nwhether our Department\u2019s costs will be fully reimbursed.\n\n\n\n\n                                          JA147\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB   Document 4-11      Filed 03/07/25    Page 11 of 11\n\n\n\n\n                   Executed on March 5, 2025, at Trenton, New Jersey.\n\n\n\n\n                   Robert Asaro-Angelo, Commissioner\n                   New Jersey Department of Labor & Workforce Development\n\n\n\n\n                                JA148\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB   Document 4-12   Filed 03/07/25   Page 1 of 7\n\n\n\n\n                  Exhibit ,\n\n\n\n\n                             JA149\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB   Document 4-12   Filed 03/07/25   Page 2 of 7\n\n\n\n\n                             JA150\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB   Document 4-12   Filed 03/07/25   Page 3 of 7\n\n\n\n\n                             JA151\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB   Document 4-12   Filed 03/07/25   Page 4 of 7\n\n\n\n\n                             JA152\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB   Document 4-12   Filed 03/07/25   Page 5 of 7\n\n\n\n\n                             JA153\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB   Document 4-12   Filed 03/07/25   Page 6 of 7\n\n\n\n\n                             JA154\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB   Document 4-12   Filed 03/07/25   Page 7 of 7\n\n\n\n\n                             JA155\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB   Document 4-13   Filed 03/07/25   Page 1 of 5\n\n\n\n\n                  Exhibit -\n\n\n\n\n                             JA156\n\f Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB   Document 4-13   Filed 03/07/25   Page 2 of 5\n\n\n\n                   UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n                   FOR THE DISTRICT OF MARYLAND\n\n\n STATE OF MARYLAND, ET AL.,\n\n          Plaintiffs,\n                                              Case No.: 1:25-cv-\n              v.\n\nUNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF\n    AGRICULTURE, ET AL.,\n\n         Defendants.\n\n\n\n\n                              JA157\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB            Document 4-13         Filed 03/07/25      Page 3 of 5\n\n\n\n                             DECLARATION OF SCOTT MELVIN\n\n        I, Scott Melvin, declare as follows:\n\n        1.      I am a resident of the State of New York. I am over the age of 18 and have personal\n\nknowledge of all the facts stated herein, except as to those matters stated upon information and\n\nbelief; as to those matters, I believe them to be true. If called as a witness, I could and would testify\n\ncompetently to the matters set forth below.\n\n        2.      I am the Executive Deputy Commissioner of the New York State Department of\n\nLabor (NY DOL) and have nearly 30 years of government experience, including over 11 years at\n\nNY DOL. I began my tenure with NY DOL as a Special Assistant to the Commissioner in 2014,\n\nadvanced to Chief of Staff in 2016, and became Acting Executive Deputy Commissioner in 2020,\n\nfollowed by my appointment to my current role in 2021. I am responsible for the comprehensive\n\nmanagement of NY DOL\u2019s day-to-day operations and spending, overseeing 14 distinct divisions\n\nand offices within NY DOL, including the Workforce Development, Unemployment Insurance,\n\nand Worker Protection divisions.\n\n        3.      The NY DOL is responsible for helping New Yorkers find the careers they will\n\nlove by connecting them to employment, training, and up-skilling opportunities. As part of this\n\nmission, we assist workers who have been laid off from their jobs and process unemployment\n\napplications. NY DOL performs this function for all New Yorkers, including those who were\n\nemployed by the federal government. As Executive Deputy Commissioner, I have access to data\n\nmaintained by NY DOL documenting recent layoffs of federal workers in New York State.\n\n        4.      We have seen a significant increase in our most recent data of New Yorkers\n\nterminated by the federal government and seeking unemployment benefits. From January 21 \u2013\n\nFebruary 20, NY DOL received 178 new unemployment claims from federal employees. From\n\n\n\n\n                                               JA158\n\f          Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB        Document 4-13           Filed 03/07/25   Page 4 of 5\n\n\n\nFebruary 21 \u2013 February 27, the most recently available data set, NY DOL logged an additional\n\n372 new unemployment claims from federal employees.\n\n          5.    These layoffs will require us to assist more New Yorkers and process more\n\nunemployment applications than expected, as we were not prepared for these numbers.\n\n          6.    NY DOL is designated as New York State\u2019s lead workforce development agency\n\npursuant to N.Y. Labor Law \u00a7 851. In this capacity, NY DOL oversees a Rapid Response program\n\nthat facilitates immediate assistance to New Yorkers subject to mass layoffs as required by the\n\nfederal Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 3174(A)(2)(i). NY DOL\u2019s no-\n\ncost services include, but are not limited to, skill-based resume development, access to user\n\nfriendly job search tools, and opportunities to engage in mock interviews to improve interviewing\n\nskills.\n\n          7.    The federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act imposes notice\n\nrequirements on private employers with respect to certain mass layoffs. Similarly, pursuant to 5\n\nU.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d)(3)(A)(i), the federal government is required to notify \u201cthe State or entity\n\ndesignated by the State to carry out rapid response activities under section 134(a)(2)(A) of the\n\nWorkforce Investment Act of 1998\u201d of a plan for a reduction-in-force (RIF) of federal employees,\n\ngenerally at least 60 days in advance of any proposed RIF. Pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 3361(a), the\n\nreference to section 134(a)(2)(A) of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 is deemed to refer to\n\nthe Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 3174(A)(2)(i). The notice required by\n\n5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d)(3)(A) is intended to trigger rapid response activities since it is directed to the\n\nstate entity required to carry out rapid response activities.\n\n          8.    To the best of my knowledge, NY DOL has not received any notices under 5 U.S.C.\n\n\u00a7 3502(d)(3)(A) since January 20, 2025.\n\n\n\n\n                                              JA159\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB            Document 4-13         Filed 03/07/25      Page 5 of 5\n\n\n\n                Executed on March 6, 2025, at New York, New York,\n\n\n\n                                                /s/ Scott Melvin\n                                                Scott Melvin\n                                                Executive Deputy Commissioner\n                                                New York State Department of Labor\n\n\n*Counsel hereby certifies she has a signed copy of the foregoing document available for inspection at any\ntime by the court or a party to this action.\n\n\n\n\n                                               JA160\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB   Document 4-14   Filed 03/07/25   Page 1 of 6\n\n\n\n\n                  Exhibit .\n\n\n\n\n                             JA161\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB   Document 4-14   Filed 03/07/25   Page 2 of 6\n\n\n\n\n                             JA162\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB   Document 4-14   Filed 03/07/25   Page 3 of 6\n\n\n\n\n                             JA163\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB   Document 4-14   Filed 03/07/25   Page 4 of 6\n\n\n\n\n                             JA164\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB   Document 4-14   Filed 03/07/25   Page 5 of 6\n\n\n\n\n                             JA165\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB   Document 4-14   Filed 03/07/25   Page 6 of 6\n\n\n\n\n                             JA166\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB   Document 4-15   Filed 03/07/25   Page 1 of 7\n\n\n\n\n                  Exhibit /\n\n\n\n\n                             JA167\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 4-15        Filed 03/07/25      Page 2 of 7\n\n\n\n                            UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n                            FOR THE DISTRICT OF MARYLAND\n\n\n      STATE OF MARYLAND, ET AL.,\n\n                   Plaintiffs,\n                                                               Case No.: 1:25-cv-\n                       v.\n\n    UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF\n        AGRICULTURE, ET AL.,\n\n                  Defendants.\n\n\n\n\n                       DECLARATION OF KRISTINE CAMPAGNA\n\n       I, Kristine Campagna, hereby declare as follows:\n\n1. I am a resident of the State of Rhode Island and over the age of 18.\n\n2. I am the Associate Director for Community and Health Equity (\u201cCHE\u201d) Division at the Rhode\n\n   Island Department of Health (\u201cRIDOH\u201d) and have been held this position since January 2022.\n\n3. I hold a Master\u2019s Degree in Education and have been with RIDOH since 2009. I provide\n\n   leadership, strategic vision, and policy direction to staff and programs in the Division of CHE.\n\n   I work directly with the Director of RIDOH and other executive leadership staff to implement\n\n   RIDOH\u2019s mission to eliminate health disparities and achieve health equity for all Rhode\n\n   Islanders.\n\n4. The information in the statements set forth below was compiled through personal knowledge,\n\n   and from RIDOH personnel who have assisted in gathering this information from our agency.\n\n5. RIDOH\u2019s mission is to protect public health, promote healthy communities, and continue to\n\n   improve the quality of health care in Rhode Island. Among its many functions, RIDOH\n\n\n\n\n                                            JA168\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 4-15         Filed 03/07/25    Page 3 of 7\n\n\n\n   dedicates substantial resources to preventing the spread of infectious diseases, developing\n\n   comprehensive emergency preparedness plans to coordinate disaster response efforts, and\n\n   implementing public health programs.\n\n6. In conjunction with the mission of RIDOH, the Division of CHE strives to prevent diseases\n\n   and protect and promote health and safety of the people of Rhode Island.\n\n7. To support these critical goals, RIDOH and CHE have a long-standing history of securing\n\n   federal civil service personnel detail from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n\n   (\u201cCDC\u201d) through its Public Health Associate Program for Recent Graduates (\u201cPHAP\u201d). PHAP\n\n   is a competitive, two-year training program created by the CDC that places new college\n\n   graduates (\u201cAssociates\u201d) with tribal, local, and territorial public health agencies and\n\n   nongovernmental organizations. Associates work alongside other public health professionals\n\n   in a range of settings. Pursuant to the Public Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 215, RIDOH\n\n   enters into a two-year agreement with the CDC for each Associate detailed to RIDOH. CDC\n\n   covers all the Associate\u2019s costs, including their salary and benefits.\n\n8. Since 2017, RIDOH has hosted numerous PHAP Associates in the areas of emergency\n\n   preparedness, violence and injury prevention, and adolescent health. Their work has greatly\n\n   contributed to the work of RIDOH.\n\n9. Over the past two years, CDC detailed two (2) Associates at different RIDOH divisions to\n\n   perform core public health functions.\n\n10. One Associate was placed in RIDOH\u2019s Violence and Injury Prevention Program (\u201cVIPP\u201d),\n\n   which applied to become a host site for PHAP in February 2024. The VIPP Associate began\n\n   his 2-year term placement with VIPP in October 2024.\n\n\n\n\n                                             JA169\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB         Document 4-15        Filed 03/07/25     Page 4 of 7\n\n\n\n11. RIDOH\u2019s VIPP planned to have the VIPP Associate contribute to cross-cutting initiatives\n\n   focused primarily on prevention of Adverse Childhood Experiences (\u201cACEs\u201d). There is no\n\n   dedicated funding or focus in the current VIPP portfolio for this type of work, despite ACEs\n\n   being a common risk factor of suicide and domestic violence.\n\n12. The work undertaken by the VIPP Associate provides an opportunity to advance initiatives\n\n   pertaining to violence prevention at multiple levels. As such, the VIPP Associate\u2019s work is\n\n   critical to the work undertaken throughout RIDOH. Notably, at the time of his termination, the\n\n   VIPP Associate was working on a comprehensive landscape analysis on Adverse Childhood\n\n   Experiences. This work, in turn, informs initiatives associated with Child Death Review\n\n   recommendations to identify preventable circumstances to improve health and safety for all\n\n   children.\n\n13. The second PHAP Associate was placed in RIDOH\u2019s Adolescent, School and Reproductive\n\n   Health (\u201cASRH\u201d) Programs, which has been a host site for the competitive PHAP since 2020.\n\n14. In February 2023, ASRH Programs applied to serve as a host site for another PHAP Associate.\n\n   In September 2023, RIDOH was notified that ASRH Programs were awarded as a host site and\n\n   matched with a PHAP candidate based upon our application. The ASRH Programs Associate\n\n   began her two-year term placement with the program in November 2023.\n\n15. ASRH Programs have invested nearly fifteen months hiring, onboarding, training, and\n\n   supporting the ASRH Programs Associate, to contribute to cross-cutting initiatives that\n\n   advance health and well-being for school-age children and adolescents in Rhode Island.\n\n16. Among other activities, the ASRH Programs Associate supported implementation of evidence-\n\n   based youth programming, technical assistance for schools and community-based partners, and\n\n   community outreach and engagement. The goal for this position was to help expand initiatives\n\n\n\n\n                                           JA170\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB         Document 4-15        Filed 03/07/25      Page 5 of 7\n\n\n\n   for positive youth-development programming, support communities of youth-serving\n\n   professionals, and develop collaborative community engagement and partnerships.\n\n17. RIDOH invested significant time and resources to train these Associates\u2014which typically\n\n   takes four to six months to complete\u2014to carry out the above-described work and integrate\n\n   them into the state\u2019s existing teams performing the same work.\n\n18. On February 19, 2025, RIDOH learned that the two Associates had been terminated from their\n\n   positions on February 15, 2025\u2014before the expiration of their contractual two-year terms\u2014\n\n   and placed on immediate administrative leave. Adding to the confusion, on March 5, 2025,\n\n   RIDOH informally learned that the two Associates have been notified that their positions will\n\n   be reinstated. RIDOH has yet to receive confirmation of this change from the CDC.\n\n19. Despite their reinstatement, the sudden loss of essential personnel, coupled with the lack of\n\n   notice, caused RIDOH significant harm and disruption. RIDOH had invested significant time\n\n   and resources into months-long training for the Associates, and the agency did not have the\n\n   budgetary flexibility or hiring authority to replace them, particularly given the lack of any\n\n   notice. The unexpected staffing shortages and imminent need to reallocate and train existing\n\n   staff have already caused delays and administrative chaos, which impeded RIDOH\u2019s ability to\n\n   fulfill its mission of preventing disease and promoting public health in the state. The loss in\n\n   workforce capacity during this time hampered RIDOH\u2019s ability to fully respond to these public\n\n   health threats.\n\n\n\n\n                                            JA171\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 4-15        Filed 03/07/25      Page 6 of 7\n\n\n\n20. The lack of notice compounded the challenges created by the terminations. RIDOH was not\n\n   able to plan for the terminations, resulting in administrative inefficiencies, duplicative work,\n\n   and impeded critical work undertaken by RIDOH.\n\n\n\n\nDated: March 6, 2025                                Signed: /s/ Kristine Campagna *\n                                                           Kristine Campagna\n                                                           RIDOH Division Director\n\n                                                    *A copy of the signature page bearing an\n                                                    original signature is attached hereto.\n\n\n\n\n                                            JA172\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB   Document 4-15   Filed 03/07/25   Page 7 of 7\n\n\n\n\n                             JA173\n\f                         Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB                    Document 4-16                 Filed 03/07/25   Page 1 of 1\n\n\n\n                                                   IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n                                                      FOR THE DISTRICT OF MARYLAND\n              State of Maryland, et al.\n                                                                               *\n                    Plaintiff,\n                                                                               *\n                    v.

Clower, Ph.D.\nMarch 4, 2025\nAt the request of the Office of the Attorney General for the District of Columbia, I have prepared a\npreliminary assessment of the potential tax revenue and economic losses that would result from a\nreduction in the number of federal jobs based in the District of Columbia. The following provides a\ndescription of the findings, methods used, key assumptions, and sources of data in preparing this analysis.\nI reserve the right to modify this report based on the availability of new data and information.\nI serve as Northern Virginia Chair in Local Government and Professor of Public Policy in the Schar\nSchool of Policy and Government at George Mason University. I am also the director of the Center for\nRegional Analysis and the Stephen Fuller Institute at George Mason University. The analysis described\nhere is my own work and does not reflect the views or endorsement of George Mason University, its\nBoard of Visitors, or the Commonwealth of Virginia. Prior to joining George Mason University in August\nof 2014, I spent 23 years as an applied economic researcher at the University of North Texas with my\nfinal roles being an Associate Professor of Applied Economics and Director of the Center for Economic\nDevelopment and Research. I have performed or supervised more than three hundred analyses assessing\nthe economic and fiscal contributions of industries and employment in every state of the union.\nDescription of the Analysis\nThe findings reported below assess the loss of economic activity, jobs, and labor earnings and associated\nlocal government revenues associated with a reduction in the number of federal jobs based in the District\nof Columbia under five scenarios of direct federal job losses: 1,000 jobs; 2,000 jobs; 5,000 jobs; 10,000\njobs; and 50,000 jobs.\nData\nThere is little data immediately available on the exact positions and pay scales of jobs that are being\neliminated or are being targeted for elimination by the current federal administration. Therefore, this\nanalysis relies on several data assumptions that will tend toward understating the total potential impacts\non the District of Columbia\u2019s economy and government revenue.\nThe following data are used to model the impacts of federal job losses:\n\n      \u2022    Pay scale: The analysis uses the General Schedule (GS) Grades (1-15) in estimating lost direct\n           wages associated with the impacted federal jobs. This pay scale represents most federal jobs.\n           Executive, senior, and special scale jobs will typically have higher levels of compensation. By\n           using the GS pay scale, the impact estimates are likely to be conservative in nature.\n      \u2022    Distribution of federal employees by GS Grade: The current distribution of federal workers by\n           GS Grade was not readily available during the preparation of this analysis. Therefore, we\n           assumed the current distribution is the same as reported by the U.S. Equal Employment\n           Opportunity Commission for Fiscal Year 2013.1 This assumption likely results in understating the\n\n\n\n1\n    https://www.eeoc.gov/federal-sector/reports/table-3b-government-wide-employment-workers-gs-grades-1\n\n\n\n\n                                                    JA201\n\f        Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB             Document 4-35           Filed 03/07/25         Page 10 of 31\n\n\n\n         total potential losses since previous trends and the aging federal workforce2 suggests that a higher\n         proportion of federal workers has likely shifted to higher GS levels. (See Table A-1 below.)\n    \u2022    Pay Level: Using the GS pay scale for 2025, adjusted for the District of Columbia Region, as\n         reported by FederalPay.org, and applying the distribution of federal workers as described above,\n         the weighted average wage/salary for the federal workers who have or may lose their jobs is\n         assumed to be $104,274 per annum. Using data from a federal employment information website3,\n         the average full time federal job has benefits valued at about 43.7% of direct pay. This adjustment\n         results in total assumed average compensation for federal jobs in the District of Columbia at\n         $149,844 per annum.\nModel\nTo estimate how the loss of federal jobs in the District of Columbia will impact District revenues and\neconomic activity, assumed job losses at the estimated total compensation (wages, salaries, and benefits)\nare used as modeling inputs into the IMPLAN4 economic input-output model. The IMPLAN model is\nwidely used in academic and professional research and provides estimates of how a change in economic\nactivity, such as jobs, spreads through a regional economy. In a typical analysis of business activity, the\nIMPLAN model includes direct spending and/or job creation, indirect effects resulting from business\nspending by vendors in a given firm\u2019s supply chains, and induced impacts that represent the economic\nactivity from employees of the direct firm and vendors spending a portion of their earnings for goods and\nservices in the economy. The IMPLAN adjusts the spending to account for economic leakage\u2014spending\nthat leaves the study area as purchases of imported goods and services. For example, many federal\nworkers spend a portion of their earnings on automobiles and gasoline, neither of which is produced in the\nDistrict of Columbia but is sold there. When added together, the adjusted spending represented by direct,\nindirect, and induced effects is often greater than the direct spending, which is the \u201cmultiplier\u201d effect.\nUnfortunately, multipliers work in both directions. A loss of a federal job means that former job holders\nwill have less household income to purchase goods and services, which lowers aggregate demand and has\nspillover effects on other jobs in the District of Columbia.5\nAn important caveat and feature of modeling the impacts, positive or negative, of federal jobs is that the\nIMPLAN model only estimates induced (household spending) impacts for this sector of the economy.\nIndirect effects, purchases related to supporting that job, are treated through separately assessing\ngovernment procurement.

To\nassess the potential economic and revenue losses under an assumption that federal workers quickly find\nalternative employment, the analysis presented below compared federal jobs by occupation and posted\nopen positions in the District of Columbia. The key assumption, which may not hold in practice, is that\ndisplaced federal workers can obtain other employment in a matching occupation. For example, the\nassumption is that a private sector, for-profit business will see a long term federal employee as being\nqualified based on government job experience.\nIn performing this analysis, data on federal staffing patterns (jobs by occupation) for the District of\nColumbia from Lightcast are compared to a listing of job postings also from Lightcast. The job postings\ndata are gathered through web-scraping online job advertisement postings that are algorithmically\nadjusted to prevent duplicating job postings across differing websites. Both data sets include estimates of\nwages by occupation, which allows an estimate of any wage differentials and the resulting impacts on\neconomic activity and tax revenue.6 There is emerging concern among labor market analysts that an\nincreasing share of job posting are \u201cghost\u201d jobs, meaning that employers use the advertisements and\npostings to collect resumes for filling potential future job openings. However, to be conservative, this\nanalysis assumes the counts of unique job postings represent opportunities for similarly skilled displaced\nfederal workers. In addition, it appears that about 4.3% of the matching job ads are for federal jobs. We\nhave left these jobs in the calculations of alternative jobs, which may result in underestimating total job\nand tax revenue losses. The appendix includes a sample of the data gathered.\n\n\n\n6\n There is earnings data missing for some occupations in the job posting data. Absent any other information, this\nanalysis assumes the same federal and private sector wage rate for those occupations.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    JA204\n\f        Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB             Document 4-35           Filed 03/07/25         Page 13 of 31\n\n\n\nOne important adjustment made to the Lightcast data is to convert wage/salary data to total compensation\nlevels that include the value of benefits.7 For federal jobs, the adjustment is the same as described above.\nFor private sector jobs, benefits add an average 29.6% increase to wages based on data from the U.S.\nBureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 Employer Costs for Employee Compensation data series. As might be\nexpected, in some occupations, such as those in certain information technology occupations, at lower\nlevels of federal job losses it is reasonable to assume the displaced federal workers can find alternative\nemployment. However, flooding the market with new job seekers in a brief period will exceed current\nlabor demand. This could result in an out-migration of workers that will permanently impact the local and\nregional economy. That analysis is beyond the scope of this initial impact assessment. Even adjusted for\nhigher benefit levels, in most occupations, a federal worker could potentially receive an effective pay\nraise for moving to the private sector. For purposes of adjusting our initial estimates to account for\nalternative employment opportunities, the analysis uses partial, not whole number, job counts.\nIt is important to emphasize that this analysis is based on the distribution of occupations across all District\nof Columbia based civilian federal workers. There is no information available for this analysis that details\nthe distribution of occupations of those positions that have been and will be terminated.\nThe alternative analysis shows that at lower levels of federal job disruption, many of the displaced\nworkers may be able to find alternative employment, which will mitigate the economic and fiscal losses\nfor the District of Columbia (see Table 3).\nTable 3: Economic and Tax Revenue Losses from a Reduction in Federal Jobs in the District of\nColumbia, Assuming Similar Alternative Employment for Displaced Workers, Annual Losses,\n($2025)\n    Number of Federal Jobs Lost        1,000           2,000            5,000            10,000             50,000\n    Number of Net Jobs Lost             204             505             1,642             4,732             41,514\n    Economic Losses\n    Economic Activity Reduction     $58,235,110    $134,153,824      $412,195,150    $1,130,899,335     $8,972,689,044\n    Gross State Product Lost        $56,205,102    $129,477,377      $397,826,506    $1,091,477,500     $8,659,911,541\n    Labor Income                    $45,089,210    $103,870,154      $319,146,876      $875,611,928     $6,947,208,571\n    Total Direct & Induced Jobs           227.0            561.6           1,826.8           5,263.1           46,176.4\n    Tax Loses\n    Corporate Profits Tax              $210,535        $485,000        $1,490,190        $4,088,487        $32,438,538\n    Income Tax                         $548,482      $1,263,515        $3,882,222       $10,651,272        $84,508,449\n    Sales Tax                           $99,030        $228,132          $700,948        $1,923,123        $15,258,284\n    Property Tax                       $191,737        $441,698        $1,357,141        $3,723,454        $29,542,323\n    Other Taxes & Assessments           $50,371        $116,037          $356,532          $978,181          $7,761,003\n    TOTAL TAX LOSSES                 $1,100,155      $2,534,383        $7,787,033       $21,364,516       $169,508,598\nSources: U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, FederalPay.org, Bureau of Labor Statistics,\nFederalJobs.net, Lightcast, IMPLAN, author\u2019s calculations.\n\n\n\n\n7\n Lightcast reports estimates of median earnings.

The FY 2025 local source revenue forecast has been revised downward\nby $21.6 million as year-to-date collections show lower-than-expected receipts for the sales and\nnon-tax revenue sources. The revenue forecast for the rest of the financial plan period has also\nbeen revised downward by an average of $342.1 million annually, largely due to forecasted sharp\ndeclines in employment levels as the Federal government proceeds with reducing its workforce\nsignificantly. The resulting decline in income and consumption means lower revenue from the\nDistrict\u2019s individual income and sales taxes. Real property tax revenue in this estimate has also\nbeen lowered based on lower assessed values across almost all classes of properties. This reflects\nongoing weakness in commercial property values due to expanded remote work since the\npandemic and a recent decline in residential home prices.\n\nFebruary 2025 Revenue Estimate Compared to Previous Estimate\n                                                      Actual            Estimate                      Projections\nLocal Source, General Fund Revenue\nEstimate ($M)                                        FY 2024 FY 2025 FY 2026 FY 2027 FY 2028 FY 2029\nDecember 2024 Revenue Estimate                       10,232.2 10,701.8 10,955.6 11,255.2 11,642.0\n  February Revision to the Estimate-Local                 -8.3    -21.6  -325.0   -337.8   -363.2\nFebruary 2025 Revenue Estimate                       10,223.9 10,680.2 10,630.6 10,917.4 11,278.7 11,656.4\n\nRevenue Change From Previous Year\n Amount                                                  249.4        456.3       (49.6)        286.7          361.4   377.6\n  Year-Over-Year Percent Change                          2.5%         4.5%        -0.5%         2.7%           3.3%    3.3%\n\n\n                   John A.

Changes in the economic landscape as the\nnew administration proceeds with reductions to the federal workforce will shape revenue trends\nfor the remainder of FY 2025.\nDue to ongoing and planned federal workforce reductions, the District's economic outlook has\ndeteriorated significantly from the December forecast. Nationally, over 75,000 federal employees\nhave accepted buyouts, many probationary federal employees have been fired, and the\nadministration has instituted a hiring freeze, allowing only one replacement employee for every\nfour that leave. Federal employment in the District is projected to decline by approximately 40,000,\nor 21 percent, by the end of the financial plan period. With fewer federal employees in the region,\nspending on restaurants, retail, transportation, and other taxable goods and services is expected to\ndecline, particularly for businesses that rely on federal workers. Job losses are also anticipated for\nfederal contracting, hospitality, and transportation sectors, as reduced federal employment leads\nto lower demand in these sectors. There is a high degree of uncertainty around the forecast as some\nof the new administration's executive actions have or likely will be challenged in the courts, as\nnew ones emerge, making meaningful economic impact analysis extremely difficult.\nA variety of sources provide the basis for this estimate, including cash collection reports; federal\ndata on District population, employment, and income; private data sources on housing, commercial\nreal estate, and hotels; forecasts of the U.S. economy prepared by the Congressional Budget Office,\nand private-sector economists, including the Blue Chip consensus forecast of 50 private sector\neconomists and two private-sector firms (S&P Global and Moody\u2019s Analytics) that also prepare\nforecasts of the District\u2019s economy. In addition, comments were received from recent meetings of\nthree advisory groups of external subject-matter experts. These discussions focused on general\nbusiness and economic conditions and real estate market developments in the District and the\nneighboring jurisdictions.\n\nRevenue Highlights\nReal Property Tax\nReal property tax revenue for FY 2025 is unchanged from the December forecast. For FY 2026,\nthe revenue forecast has been revised downward by $113 million due to a 2.2 percent decline in\nthe total taxable real property assessments compared to FY 2025. These assessments reflect a\nsignificant adjustment that includes the most recent market valuations. With the reductions in\nassessments, real property tax revenue for FY 2026 is expected to decline by 3.2 percent.\nWhile the revenue forecast for FY 2027 and FY 2028 has been revised downward from previous\nestimates, the projected growth rates have been adjusted upward from the December forecast for\ntwo key reasons. First, CoStar\u2019s latest projections indicate that office market values will rise in\n2026, driven by improving vacancy rates, higher rents per square foot, and favorable market\ncapitalization rates. Second, the substantial downward adjustment to FY 2026 property\nassessments means the forecasted improvements in market valuations start from a lower base. As\na result, real property tax revenue is expected to grow by an average of 2.6 percent annually during\nthe period FY 2027 through FY 2029.\n\n\n\n\n                                             JA209\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 4-35        Filed 03/07/25      Page 18 of 31\nFebruary 2025 Revenue Estimates\nFebruary 28, 2025\nPage 3\n\nSales Tax\nThe February forecast for general sales tax revenue has been lowered significantly across the\nforecast period due to anticipated sharp reductions in federal employment and their ripple effect\non the District\u2019s economy and tax base. Downward revisions begin with a relatively modest $15\nmillion in FY 2025, escalating to nearly $80 million by FY 2028. The smaller impact in FY 2025\nis based on substantial collections for the first quarter, amounting to nearly 4 percent growth year-\nto-date. However, as District employment deteriorates, consumers are expected to spend less,\nreducing sales tax receipts.\nThe average annual growth rate of 2.9 percent for sales tax over the financial plan period is\nprimarily driven by incremental sales tax rate increases enacted under the FY 2025 Budget Support\nAct (BSA); from 6 percent in FY 2025 to 6.5 percent in FY 2026 and 7 percent in FY 2027 and\nonwards. Without these rate increases, underlying sales tax revenue growth would be notably\nweaker due to employment reductions.\nIncome Taxes\nIndividual Income Taxes\nYear-to-date individual income tax receipts have grown 6.9 percent, driven entirely by an 8.2\npercent increase in withholding tax collections compared to last year. However, withholding tax\nrevenue growth is expected to slow as the federal workforce reductions decrease the wages and\nsalaries of District residents. For FY 2025, the economic outlook for resident wages has been\nrevised only slightly, meaning the strong year-to-date collections will help offset any immediate\nimpact. The withholding tax revenue forecast for FY 2026 through FY 2029 has been revised\ndownward to reflect the full impact of the federal job cuts; by $94.7 million in FY 2026 and an\naverage reduction of $139.7 million per year for the rest of the financial plan period.\nNon-withholding income taxes are down 3.4 percent year-to-date compared to last year, primarily\ndue to higher refunds. However, January estimated payments, a key indicator of the upcoming\nApril tax filings, rose 3.8 percent. This is a notable improvement from the double-digit declines\nseen in FY 2023 and FY 2024. As a result, the FY 2025 non-withholding tax revenue forecast was\nrevised upward and is now projected to increase by 9.5 percent to reflect the improved estimated\npayments performance in January. Beyond FY 2025, the forecast for non-withholding taxes has\nbeen revised downward, reflecting expectations of weaker S&P 500 earnings as the market adjusts\nto align with its long-term average after the increases over the last two years.\nOverall individual income tax is projected to increase by 4.5 percent in FY 2025 and decline by\n0.7 percent in FY 2026. Growth is expected to average 3.2 percent for the remainder of the\nfinancial plan period.\nCorporate Franchise Tax\nYear-to-date corporation franchise tax receipts have risen 13.9 percent compared to the same\nperiod last year, driven by higher estimated and final tax payments. As a result, the FY 2025\ncorporate franchise tax revenue forecast has been revised upward by $13.4 million.\nThe forecast for the out years is slightly reduced, reflecting the lower earnings forecasts for large\npublic companies in defense and other government support service sectors. As a result, corporate\n\n\n                                             JA210\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 4-35        Filed 03/07/25       Page 19 of 31\nFebruary 2025 Revenue Estimates\nFebruary 28, 2025\nPage 4\n\nfranchise taxes are expected to decline by 1.4 percent in FY 2026 and revert to an average growth\nof 1.3 percent through the remainder of the financial plan period.\nUnincorporated Business Franchise Tax\nYear-to-date unincorporated business tax receipts have surged by 18.2 percent, a sharp reversal\nfrom the 10.4 percent decline projected in the December forecast. This growth is largely driven by\nhigher January estimated tax payments, which historically served as a key indicator for the April\ntax filing season. As a result, the FY 2025 unincorporated business tax revenue forecast has been\nrevised upward by $15.8 million, reflecting both the strong year-to-date gains and adjustments for\nthe estimated impact of previously enacted tax credits. While the previously forecasted decline in\nunincorporated business tax revenue for FY 2025 has been revised to 2.2 percent (an improvement\nfrom the earlier 10.4 percent decline), the growth rate for the remainder of the financial plan period\nis expected to remain negative, amidst continued challenges for the real estate sector, from which\nmost District unincorporated businesses derive their earnings.\nGross Receipts Tax Revenues\nYear-to-date gross receipts tax collections have increased 15.2 percent in FY 2025, driven\nprimarily by higher sports wagering and public utility tax payments compared to FY 2024. The\nextreme cold weather has likely contributed to increased public utility consumption, prompting an\nupward revision to the previous forecast. Additionally, insurance premium tax receipts, another\nkey component of gross receipts, have shown strong year-to-date gains, benefiting from the impact\nof higher inflation on insurance premium collections. As a result, the gross receipts tax revenue\nforecast has been revised upward by $18.1 million for FY 2025, and by an average of $31.8 million\nannually from FY 2026 to FY 2028.\nDeed Tax Revenues\nYear-to-date deed tax collections\u2014including deed recordation, deed transfer, and economic\ninterest taxes\u2014have increased 20 percent compared to FY 2024, driven by a higher volume and\nvalue of commercial, single-family, and vacant property sales. This growth aligns with the\nDecember forecast, and as a result, the deed taxes revenue forecast remains largely unchanged.\nNon-Tax Revenue\nThe non-tax revenue forecast for the financial plan period has been significantly reduced, primarily\ndue to downward revisions in fines and miscellaneous revenue. Recent data on the expanded\nautomated traffic enforcement units implemented last year indicate lower-than-expected ticket\nissuance rates, leading to a downward revision in fines and forfeitures revenue by an average of\n$23.1 million annually throughout the forecast period. Additionally, lower than expected\ninvestment income from reserves\u2014driven by a combination of reduced investible reserves and\nlower interest rates compared to the previous year\u2014has led to a significant reduction in the\nmiscellaneous revenue component of local fund revenue.\n\n\n\n\n                                              JA211\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 4-35         Filed 03/07/25     Page 20 of 31\nFebruary 2025 Revenue Estimates\nFebruary 28, 2025\nPage 5\n\nNational and Regional Economies\n\nNational Economy\n\nU.S. GDP grew at an annual rate of 2.3 percent in the fourth quarter, according to the Bureau of\nEconomic Analysis\u2019 (BEA) advance estimate. Final sales to private domestic purchasers, a key\nmeasure of underlying demand, rose 3.2 percent, reflecting strong momentum. For the full year\nof 2024, the economy expanded by a solid 2.8 percent, exceeding economists' expectations. The\nprimary driver of GDP growth was consumer spending, which accounted for 1.9 percent of the\nannual growth rate. Consumer spending has remained the cornerstone of economic growth in the\npost-pandemic years, supporting robust expansion despite the Federal Reserve\u2019s efforts to slow\nthe economy in its fight against inflation.\n\nInflation continued to ease in 2024, but progress toward the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2 percent target has\nslowed. For the year, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index rose by only 2.5\npercent, a significant decline from 3.8 percent in 2023. Excluding food and energy, the core PCE\nprice index increased by 2.8 percent, down from 4.1 percent the previous year. However,\ninflationary pressures picked up toward the end of the year, with the core CPI inflation rate rising\nfrom 2.4 percent in Q3 to 3.6 percent in Q4.\n\nThe labor market rebounded after a slowdown in the third quarter of 2024, demonstrating renewed\nmomentum. The January 2025 employment report showed a strong increase in payrolls, significant\nupward revisions to job growth for November and December 2024, and a drop in the\nunemployment rate to 4 percent.\n\nEmployment growth in the Washington metropolitan area continued to lag the national average in\n2024, with regional employment increasing 0.8 percent for the year compared to 1.3 percent\nnationally. Slowing job growth is likely to remain a drag on the region\u2019s economy.\n\nU.S. Recent History\n                                                       2023q4    2024q1 2024q2 2024q3 2024q4\nReal GDP (% change from prior year)                      3.2       2.9      3.0      2.7    2.5\nNominal GDP (% change from prior year)                   5.8       5.4      5.7     5.0     5.0\nNominal Personal Income (% change from prior year)       5.1       5.9      5.5     5.2     5.4\nUnemployment rate (%)                                    3.8       3.8      4.0     4.2     4.1\nCPI (% change from prior year)                            3.2        3.2     3.2     2.6     2.7\nYield on 10-Yr Treasury (%)                               4.4        4.2     4.4     4.0     4.3\nS&P 500 (avg level)                                     4,472       4,996 5,254 5,546 5,911\nSource: Bureau of Economic Analysis, Bureau of Labor Statistics, SP Global and Moody\u2019s Analytics.\n\n\n\n\n                                             JA212\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 4-35          Filed 03/07/25       Page 21 of 31\nFebruary 2025 Revenue Estimates\nFebruary 28, 2025\nPage 6\n\nU.S. Economic Outlook\n                                        FY 2024    FY 2025   FY 2026    FY 2027    FY 2028   FY 2029\n                                        (actual)    (est.)

Many analysts predict that implementing substantial import\ntariffs temporarily increases inflation in 2025, while workforce reductions may slow national\nemployment growth. However, since federal employees (excluding the U.S. Postal Service)\naccount for just over 1.4 percent of the civilian workforce, overall employment is still expected to\nexpand in the coming months.\n\nThe Federal Reserve held the federal funds rate steady at its January 2025 meeting, maintaining a\ntotal of 100 basis points in rate cuts since the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) began\nadjusting the target range in September 2024. While moderating inflation has given the Federal\nReserve room to ease monetary policy, strong job growth and a recent increase in core CPI\ninflation have reduced the urgency for further cuts. Lower rates will be welcomed by prospective\nhomebuyers, many of whom were priced out of the housing market due to previously high\nborrowing costs. Additionally, rate cuts should relieve pressure on other interest-sensitive sectors,\nproviding a boost to the broader economy, and greater stability in the job market. The Federal\nReserve is expected to pause additional rate reductions in the first half of 2025 to assess the\neconomic impact of federal policy changes.\n\nBased on insights from sources such as S&P Global and Moody's, we expect the recent strength\nin economic growth to be carried over to the first half of calendar 2025. However, growth is\nexpected to moderate in the second half of 2025 and in 2026 due to policy uncertainties and high\ninterest rates. The GDP projections, along with forecasts for other economic activities in the nation\nand the District of Columbia, depend on a combination of factors, including key economic\nindicators, global market trends, geopolitical events, and changes in monetary and fiscal policy.\nThe inherent uncertainties and complexities influencing current economic dynamics make it\ncrucial to monitor these factors closely to gain a comprehensive understanding of the evolving\neconomic landscape.\n\nDistrict Economy\n\nWhile the District\u2019s economy continues to recover from the pandemic-induced recession of 2020,\nit has consistently underperformed the national economy across most indicators. The District\nremains below pre-pandemic employment levels, with approximately 26,600 fewer jobs recorded\nin the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to early 2020 (Q1 2020). Among major industries, only the\n\n\n\n\n                                                JA213\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 4-35        Filed 03/07/25      Page 22 of 31\nFebruary 2025 Revenue Estimates\nFebruary 28, 2025\nPage 7\n\nProfessional and Management sector and the District of Columbia government had surpassed their\nearly 2020 employment levels by the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nEmployment growth in the District has accelerated this year. From the fourth quarter of 2023 to\nthe fourth quarter of 2024, total employment in the District increased by 11,200 jobs (1.4 percent\nyear-over-year), surpassing both the District\u2019s historical average and the national growth rate of\n1.2 percent.\n\nThe professional and management sector led job gains, adding 5,261 positions over the year. The\nLeisure and Hospitality sector, which suffered severe job losses during the pandemic\u2014shedding\n60 percent of its workforce in the second quarter of 2020\u2014has rebounded to 97 percent of pre-\npandemic levels. Additionally, the Other Services sector, which includes nonprofit organizations,\nrecorded a strong gain of 3,433 jobs.\n\nOther sectors, including trade, transportation and utilities, education and health, and the District\ngovernment experienced modest job growth. In contrast, employment in the federal government,\ninformation and financial services, and business services sectors, along with other private\nindustries, saw slight declines.\n\nThe District's unemployment rate averaged 5.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2024. Although still\nnear historically low levels, it increased from 4.9 percent in the same quarter of the previous year,\nand has been rising for the past two years. This trend suggests that the District's labor market is\nstruggling to absorb the new residents it continues to attract.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, the District\u2019s real gross state product (GSP) reached $149.5 billion,\ngrowing 2 percent from the second quarter. The economy is driven primarily by five key sectors\u2014\nGovernment (including Federal and D.C.) at 30 percent, Professional, Management and Business\nServices at 22 percent, Finance and Real Estate Services at 13 percent, Information Services at 9\npercent, and Other Services at 6 percent\u2014which together account for 80 percent of the District\u2019s\nGSP. Growth in the third quarter was largely concentrated in just two sectors: professional,\nmanagement and business services and information services, which accounted for 80 percent of\nthe expansion.\n\nPersonal income in the District grew by 5.1 percent in the third quarter of 2024, slightly trailing\nthe national increase of 5.2 percent during the same period. Per capita personal income in the\nDistrict has consistently exceeded that of all 50 states. In 2023, it reached $106,816, compared to\nthe national average of $69,810, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. The District\nserves as a hub for high-paying jobs, driven largely by the substantial presence of the federal\ngovernment, which offers salaries well above the national average. In the third quarter of 2024,\nthe federal government accounted for 27.6 percent of all wages in the District. Additionally,\nproximity to federal agencies attracts private contractors that provide competitive wages to skilled\nprofessionals. Despite its high-income sectors, the District also has a significant lower-income\npopulation, with 14 percent of residents living below the poverty line in 2023.\n\n\n\n\n                                             JA214\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 4-35         Filed 03/07/25      Page 23 of 31\nFebruary 2025 Revenue Estimates\nFebruary 28, 2025\nPage 8\n\n D.C.

Although personal income growth in the\nDistrict lagged the national average during the pandemic years, it experienced a strong rebound in\n2022\u20132023. As a result, by the third quarter of 2024, the District's personal income had nearly\nreturned to pace with the national trend.\n\nTourism is a vital component of the District\u2019s economy, employing approximately 10 percent of\nthe city\u2019s workforce. According to Destination DC, the city welcomed nearly 26 million visitors\nin the past year, including 24 million domestic and 1.95 million international travelers. Strong\ndemand from both consumers and businesses has driven a surge in activity at the region\u2019s major\nairports\u2014Ronald Reagan Washington National, Washington Dulles International, and\nBaltimore/Washington International\u2014with airport traffic increasing by 7 percent in the 12 months\nending September 2024 compared to the previous year. The hospitality sector has also seen gains,\nwith 3.2 percent more hotel-room-days sold in the fourth quarter of 2024 than a year ago, while\nthe average room rate rose by 4.6 percent. Additionally, weekend rail ridership on WMATA in\n2024 surpassed pre-pandemic levels, marking an 11 percent increase from 2023.\n\nHigher mortgage interest rates have slowed existing home sales both nationally and regionally\nfrom their post-pandemic highs. In the District, the number of active housing units for sale remains\nexceptionally low, with closed sales of existing homes in 2024 totaling approximately 6,900 units,\nthe lowest level in over a decade. Housing starts have also declined sharply, falling to an annual\nrate of 1,426 units in the fourth quarter. Although this represents a slight rebound from the decade-\nlow of 972 units in the third quarter, it is still below the 2,131 units recorded in the same period of\n2023. This slowdown has had a broad economic impact, reducing revenue in real estate and\nconstruction-related sectors, and likely contributing to the region\u2019s tight labor market, further\nlimiting economic expansion.\n\nHighlighting a positive trend, the District\u2019s civilian labor force and resident employment surpassed\ntheir pre-pandemic peak in the first quarter of 2024. After experiencing a significant population\ndecline in 2020, the District has recorded three consecutive years of population growth, reversing\nthe losses seen during the COVID-19 pandemic. In December 2024, the U.S. Census Bureau\nreleased updated estimates showing that the District\u2019s population grew from 687,324 to 702,250\n\n\n\n                                              JA215\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 4-35        Filed 03/07/25         Page 24 of 31\nFebruary 2025 Revenue Estimates\nFebruary 28, 2025\nPage 9\n\nbetween July 2023 and July 2024, a net increase of 14,926 residents.

The District has the most\ngovernment-centered economy in the United States, a characteristic that offers both stability and\nchallenges. Historically, the substantial presence of federal agencies helps buffer against economic\nfluctuations that may disrupt private-sector industries. During the early months of the pandemic,\nfederal employment in the District expanded as the government increased its role in crisis response,\nhiring more staff for agencies focused on health, safety, and economic recovery.\n\nThe efforts to reduce the federal workforce are expected to have a disproportionate impact on the\nDistrict\u2019s economy. While federal jobs (excluding the U.S. Postal Service) make up just 1.4\npercent of the U.S. civilian workforce, they account for close to 25 percent of total civilian\nemployment in the District. Additionally, a significant portion of the Professional and\nManagement Services sector depends on federal funding and contracts. As a result, widespread\nfederal layoffs could have major ripple effects throughout the District\u2019s economy.\n\nWe have updated our February forecast to reflect the impact of ongoing and planned federal\nworkforce reductions on the District\u2019s economy. Federal employment in the District is expected\nto drop to 150k by the end of our forecasting period, a reduction of 40,000, or 21%, compared to\nthe previous forecast. Real GDP is now projected to grow by 0.9 percent in FY 2025, trailing the\nnational growth rate of 2.4 percent. The District\u2019s economy is expected to enter a mild recession\nin FY 2026, with GDP contracting by 1.9 percent, before beginning a gradual recovery in FY 2027\nand returning to trend growth by FY 2028 and FY 2029. Employment in the District is expected\nto remain flat in FY 2025, decline by 2.6 percent in FY 2026, and decrease by 0.4 percent in FY\n2027. Other key economic indicators have also been adjusted to reflect these latest trends.\n\n\n\n\n                                             JA216\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB            Document 4-35         Filed 03/07/25       Page 25 of 31\nFebruary 2025 Revenue Estimates\nFebruary 28, 2025\nPage 10\n\nRisks to the Forecast\n\nThe current forecast carries several notable risks. As a government-driven economy, the District\nrelies heavily on federal jobs and related economic activity, making the new administration\u2019s\npolicies a key factor in shaping the city's economic outlook. The uncertainty surrounding federal\npolicies adds complexity to forecasting. While some of the administration\u2019s proposed budget and\npersonnel cuts may be curtailed by legal challenges, the economic impact on the District will be\nmore severe if more job cuts than assumed in the forecast are implemented.\n\nThe office real estate market poses a significant risk to the forecast, with the growing volume of\nvacant office space a major concern. The average vacancy rate for office buildings in the central\nbusiness district reached 18.1% in the fourth quarter of 2024. A recent study by the D.C. Office of\nRevenue Analysis revealed that between 2020 and 2023, vacant office space increased by 8.4\nmillion square feet, a 46.2% rise, primarily driven by the shift toward remote work. This trend is\nexpected to persist for at least the next few years, even with the recent return-to-office order for\nfederal employees. The assessed values of hundreds of office buildings are projected to remain\ndepressed through 2029. A sharper-than-anticipated decline in property values could pose a risk\nto commercial property and deed tax revenues.\n\nAdditionally, potential WMATA service reductions to address its budget shortfall represent\nanother risk to the forecast. Other risks include a surge in oil prices due to the escalation of regional\nconflicts and the prospect of a prolonged government shutdown, which could place significant\nstrain on the economy. Previous government shutdowns disrupted the District\u2019s economy and had\na range of impacts on revenue.\n\nThe prevailing risks and high degree of uncertainty make for a challenging forecasting\nenvironment. As such, we will continue to monitor international, national, and local economic\nactivity for any developments that would impair the forecast.\n\nIf you have any questions regarding these matters, please contact me at (202) 727-2476.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n\n\nGlen Lee\n\n\n\n\n                                               JA217\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 4-35       Filed 03/07/25        Page 26 of 31\nFebruary 2025 Revenue Estimates\nFebruary 28, 2025\nPage 11\n\n\nDISTRIBUTION LIST\nCouncilmember Anita Bonds (At-Large)\nCouncilmember Robert White (At-Large)\nCouncilmember Christina Henderson (At-Large)\nCouncilmember Kenyan McDuffie (At-Large)\nCouncilmember Brianne Nadeau (Ward 1)\nCouncilmember Brooke Pinto (Ward 2)\nCouncilmember Matthew Frumin (Ward 3)\nCouncilmember Janeese Lewis George (Ward 4)\nCouncilmember Zachary Parker (Ward 5)\nCouncilmember Charles Allen (Ward 6)\nCouncilmember Wendell Felder (Ward 7)\nKevin Donahue, City Administrator\nLindsey Parker, Chief of Staff, Executive Office of the Mayor\nJennifer Reed, Director, Mayor\u2019s Office of Budget and Performance Management\nJennifer Budoff, Budget Director, Council of the District of Columbia\nKathy Patterson, District of Columbia Auditor\n\n\n\n\n                                            JA218\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB              Document 4-35         Filed 03/07/25      Page 27 of 31\nFebruary 2025 Revenue Estimates\nFebruary 28, 2025\nPage 12\n\n\nTABLE 1: REVENUE SUMMARY TABLE\n$ in Thousands               ACTUAL                  ESTIMATE                    OUT YEAR PROJECTIONS\n                             FY2024            FY2025       FY2026        FY2027        FY2028      FY2029\nPROPERTY                       3,039,519         2,962,559    2,869,971     2,923,002     2,991,302    3,094,247\n    Real Property              2,916,752         2,840,877    2,751,103     2,803,929     2,870,687    2,972,995\n    Personal Property             83,354            82,388       80,392        79,857        81,398       82,033\n    Public Space Rental           39,413            39,294       38,477        39,216        39,217       39,218\n    Dedicated to other funds     -52,541           -33,513      -28,399       -28,913       -24,610      -25,319\nPROPERTY (NET)                 2,986,978         2,929,046    2,841,572     2,894,088     2,966,691    3,068,927\nSALES & EXCISE                 2,084,378         2,131,157    2,209,560     2,282,908     2,335,999    2,388,608\n    General Sales              2,001,987         2,050,696    2,127,033     2,201,667     2,254,202    2,312,104\n    Alcohol                        7,027             6,886        6,817         6,715         6,782        6,850\n    Cigarette                      9,763             8,770        8,673         8,578         8,484        8,391\n    Motor Vehicle                 43,823            43,282       45,884        45,163        46,097       41,179\n    Motor Fuel                    21,778            21,523       21,152        20,786        20,434       20,084\n    Dedicated to other funds    -593,709          -579,313     -573,083      -563,399      -553,477     -561,132\nSALES & EXCISE(NET)            1,490,670         1,551,844    1,636,477     1,719,509     1,782,522    1,827,475\nINCOME                         4,271,954         4,413,057    4,356,061     4,492,741     4,597,600    4,703,284\n    Individual Income          3,138,951         3,281,725    3,258,162     3,368,786     3,473,995    3,578,790\n    Corporate Franchise          932,363           935,123      922,100       954,457       951,058      958,657\n    U.B.

My name is Jeffrey Grant. I am over the age of 18 and able to provide true and accurate\n\ntestimony under oath.\n\n2.     I give this declaration based upon my personal knowledge of the facts recited.\n\n3.     I am a resident of the State of Maryland.\n\n4.     On February 28, 2025, I retired from my role as the Deputy Director for Operations in the\n\nCenter for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight (CCIIO) within the Centers for\n\nMedicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) after 41 years of federal service.\n\n5.     In my role as Deputy Director for Operations I was responsible for all external facing\n\noperations, including Healthcare.gov, and internal operations including, personnel, contracts,\n\nbudgets, and facilities for CCIIO. In this role, I was responsible for supervising eight group\n\ndirectors and a support office, who in turn oversaw CCIIO\u2019s more than 600 employees, including\n\n\n\n\n                                            JA225\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 4-36       Filed 03/07/25      Page 3 of 7\n\n\n\n82 who were initially identified as probationary employees.1\n\n6.     Beginning after January 20, 2025, the CMS Chief Human Capital Officer (CHCO) asked\n\nCMS center directors to evaluate their probationary employees and determine any that should be\n\nremoved from service.\n\n7.     Thereafter, a manager within the CMS Office of Human Capital (OHC) followed up to\n\nrequest updates on a daily basis regarding which probationary employees should be removed from\n\nservice. This was unusual because in my experience OHC had never proactively inquired about\n\nwhether particular probationary employees should be retained, and certainly not on a daily basis.\n\nOHC explained that their ongoing requests for information about probationary employees were at\n\nthe request of the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\n8.     In accordance with the direction from the CMS CHCO, I met with group directors who\n\nreported to me and communicated to them that they should identify for removal all probationary\n\nemployees with any performance issues, even those with marginal performance issues that in other\n\ncircumstances would not have resulted in their termination.\n\n9.     The group of directors uniformly assured me that none of the probationary employees in\n\nCCIIO should be removed from service because their performance uniformly met and typically\n\nexceeded the expectations and needs of the agency for probationary employees. Accordingly, I did\n\nnot identify to OHC any probationary employees at CCIIO who should be removed from service.\n\n10.    At or about 11:00 a.m. on February 14, 2025, the Deputy Chief Operating Officer of CMS\n\nconvened an emergency meeting of CMS\u2019s Strategic Planning and Management Council, which\n\nis a coordinating body for all of the non-political center directors, deputy center directors, and\n\n\n\n\n1\n Although 82 employees were initially identified as probationary employees, approximately 10\nof these employees were not ultimately determined not to be probationary.\n                                                2\n\n                                            JA226\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 4-36         Filed 03/07/25   Page 4 of 7\n\n\n\ncareer civil service officials leading offices at CMS.\n\n11.    This Strategic Planning and Management Council meeting was conducted by Zoom.\n\nDuring the meeting, Stephanie Bovell, CHCO of CMS reported that at 1:00 pm that day, all\n\nprobationary employees at CMS would begin to be terminated, effective later that afternoon, a\n\nprocess that would run between 1:00 and 4:00 pm that day. Ms. Bovell informed the meeting that\n\nthe HHS CHCO had informed her and all other HHS Agency CHCOs of the decision to terminate\n\nall probationary employees during a call the previous evening. Ms. Bovell further explained that\n\nthe HHS CHCO informed the Agency CHCOs that probationary employees would be terminated\n\nen masse via letters that would say that the employees\u2019 unsatisfactory performance was the reason\n\nfor removal. Ms. Bovell stated that she and other HHS Agency CHCOs had told the HHS CHCO\n\nduring the February 13 call that they did not believe that the proposed termination letters were a\n\nlegitimate basis for the mass terminations of probationary employees because there was no basis\n\nfor the reasons stated in the letter. Ms. Bovell stated during the meeting that although the\n\nterminations were going forward it was unclear at the time of the Strategic Planning and\n\nManagement Council meeting whether the Agency CHCOs\u2019 feedback would result in HHS\n\nchanging the reasons for termination given in the letters.\n\n12.    During a 4:00 p.m. all-managers meeting at CMS, Ms. Bovell informed CMS managers\n\nthat the termination letters had not yet been distributed to probationary employees, and it was\n\nunclear when the terminations would take place.\n\n13.    On the morning of February 15, 2025, CMS distributed near-identical form termination\n\nletters to probationary employees across CMS, including 82 employees at CCIIO.2 No CCIIO\n\n\n\n2\n  As explained above in note 1, CMS subsequently determined that approximately 10 of these\nemployees were not in fact probationary employees, and it has subsequently rescinded the\nterminations of those non-probationary employees.\n                                                 3\n\n                                             JA227\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB             Document 4-36     Filed 03/07/25      Page 5 of 7\n\n\n\nmanagers were copied on the letters that terminated the probationary employees who worked for\n\nus, including their direct line supervisors who ordinarily would be aware of any adverse personnel\n\naction taken against any direct report.\n\n14.    These termination letters purported to justify the terminations of probationary employees\n\nby saying, \u201cUnfortunately, the Agency finds that you are not fit for continued employment because\n\nyour ability, knowledge, and skills do not fit the Agency\u2019s current needs, and your performance\n\nhas not been adequate to justify further employment at the agency.\u201d The justifications written in\n\nthese termination letters were false.\n\n15.    All of the probationary employees at CCIIO who received the February 15, 2025\n\ntermination letter were hired into positions that were tailored to the agency\u2019s needs. Specifically,\n\nevery position approved during the last few years, including every position filled by one of the\n\nprobationary employees terminated on February 15, had undergone a formal review, first by me,\n\nthen by CMS\u2019s Enterprise Workforce Investment Council (EWIC), and ultimately by CMS\u2019s Chief\n\nOperating Officer (COO). My review of these positions was to ensure that they aligned with the\n\npriorities and needs of CCIIO. EWIC\u2019s review was to ensure that the positions aligned with the\n\nagency\u2019s needs. And the COO reviewed the EWIC\u2019s recommendations to ensure that the senior\n\nofficial in charge of our human capital strategy was aware of and agreed with our assessments.\n\n16.    Every one of the terminated probationary employees had the knowledge, skills, and\n\nabilities that CCIIO required to accomplish our work and that met the specific requirements of the\n\npositions for which we hired them. In selecting these individuals, we reviewed between one and\n\ntwo thousand resumes, many of which came from other fully qualified people. We chose the best\n\nfrom hundreds of very highly qualified candidates. I personally interviewed at least a third of these\n\ncandidates. I reviewed their resumes. They were truly the best of the best. They had exceptional\n\n\n\n                                                 4\n\n                                              JA228\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 4-36        Filed 03/07/25    Page 6 of 7\n\n\n\nknowledge, skills, and ability as measured against the work we asked them to perform.\n\n17.    The termination letters were also false because they were not in fact based on any\n\nevaluation of the individual probationary employees\u2019 performance. I am lucky to have witnessed\n\nthe incredible performance of some of the probationary employees who had been with us the\n\nlongest. They personally briefed me on their work. I talked about their performance with their\n\nmanagers. Many of these workers received the highest possible performance ratings, with these\n\nratings having been completed within a month of their being terminated, ostensibly for inadequate\n\nperformance. The HHS CHCO could have obtained data from the system to assess the CCIIO\n\nprobationary employees\u2019 performance, and if he had done so, he would have seen that the\n\nemployees\u2019 performance was outstanding.\n\n18.    Some of the terminated probationary employees did not have the minimum 90 days on the\n\njob that HHS\u2019s Performance Management Appraisal Program requires prior to making any formal\n\nperformance assessment, and under HHS personnel rules, management may not make a\n\nperformance-based termination prior to actually evaluating those employees\u2019 performance.\n\n19.    The mass terminations of probationary employees at CCIIO were not based on any\n\nindividualized assessment of the probationary employees. The CMS CHCO did not review the\n\npositions for suitability, never read a single person\u2019s resume, never spoke with any of the\n\nterminated probationary employees, and had no personal knowledge of their individual\n\nperformance. Having actually reviewed the knowledge, skills, and abilities of these probationary\n\nemployees and having observed their performance and having been briefed on their performance\n\nevaluations, I can state with confidence that none of the probationary employees\u2019 terminations at\n\nCCIIO were justified by the reasons stated in the termination letters.\n\n20.    In addition, the terminations of probationary employees were not justified by the fact that\n\n\n\n                                                 5\n\n                                             JA229\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB   Document 4-36   Filed 03/07/25   Page 7 of 7\n\n\n\n\n                             JA230\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB   Document 4-37   Filed 03/07/25   Page 1 of 9\n\n\n\n\n                  Exhibit HH\n\n\n\n\n                             JA231\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 4-37          Filed 03/07/25   Page 2 of 9\n\n\n\n                            UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n                            FOR THE DISTRICT OF MARYLAND\n\n\n      STATE OF MARYLAND, ET AL.,\n\n                   Plaintiffs,\n                                                                 Case No.: 1:25-cv-\n                       v.\n\n   [LEAD DEFENDANT NAME], ET AL.,\n\n                  Defendants.\n\n\n\n\n                            DECLARATION OF TRACI DIMARTINI\n\n       I, Traci DiMartini, swear under penalty of perjury,\n\n       1.      My name is Traci DiMartini and I am an adult resident of Gaithersburg, Maryland.\n\n       2.      I served as a Human Capital Officer for the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) until\n\nMarch 3, 2025, when the IRS put me on administrative leave. The IRS is the largest bureau within\n\nthe Department of Treasury (\u201cTreasury\u201d).\n\n       3.      I am a career civil servant and have worked for the federal government for over 21\n\nyears, including at the Departments of Labor, Education, Interior, and Agriculture, as well as the\n\nOffice of Personnel Management (\u201cOPM\u201d). I was sworn in as a member of the Senior Executive\n\nService in 2016 and since that time, I have served as a Chief Human Capital Officer at the Equal\n\nEmployment Opportunity Commission, Peace Corps, the General Services Administration, and the\n\nIRS, where I served as the Human Capital Officer from June 2023 to March 2025. I have worked\n\nunder both Democratic and Republican administrations.\n\n\n\n\n                                            JA232\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 4-37       Filed 03/07/25      Page 3 of 9\n\n\n\n       4.      During my time as the Human Capital Officer for the IRS, I was the Senior\n\nExecutive responsible for overseeing all Human Capital operations at the IRS.\n\n       5.      After President Trump took office on January 20, 2025, OPM issued guidance\n\ninstructing agencies to terminate probationary employees. Around the first week of February,\n\nshortly following OPM\u2019s issuance of this guidance, the Chief Human Capital Officer for Treasury,\n\nTrevor Norris, instructed my office to begin terminating probationary employees at the IRS.\n\nSpecifically, he instructed me to identify all probationary employees at the IRS and terminate all\n\nof them \u201cbased on performance.\u201d\n\n       6.      In all my decades of human resource management for the federal government, I had\n\nnever before received a directive such as this one. Typically, the decision to terminate a\n\nprobationary employee lies solely with the probationary employee\u2019s manager. Even then, the\n\ncircumstances under which you can terminate a probationary employee are limited to instances\n\nwhere: (1) the employee is failing to meet the basic requirements of the job, or (2) the employee\n\nengages in highly inappropriate conduct while on the job. In any scenario, the poor performance\n\nor conduct must be evaluated and documented.\n\n       7.      Further, I have never heard of mass probationary employee firings. Because the\n\nbasis for any probationary employee termination is a highly individualized determination,\n\nterminating probationary employees on a large scale has never been done, to my knowledge.\n\n       8.      I attended several virtual meetings with Trevor Norris and other Human Capital\n\nOfficers at Treasury agencies (which include the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the\n\nBureau of Engraving and Printing, and the U.S. Mint) during which we discussed the directive to\n\nconduct mass terminations of probationary employees. The other agency Human Capital Officers\n\n\n\n\n                                            JA233\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 4-37        Filed 03/07/25      Page 4 of 9\n\n\n\nand I asked Mr. Norris why Treasury was directing us to terminate probationary employees, and\n\nMr. Norris informed us that it was what OPM \u201cwants to do.\u201d\n\n       9.       We also asked whether the terminations were legal. Mr. Norris explained that OPM\n\nwas taking the position that the probationary period of employment was an \u201cextension of the\n\napplication process.\u201d In my experience, this is never how probationary employment has been\n\nviewed and, candidly, makes no sense.\n\n       10.      Mr. Norris informed us that Charles Ezell, the Acting Director of OPM, Amanda\n\nScales, Mr. Ezell\u2019s Chief of Staff, and Noah Peters, were the individuals spearheading the\n\ntermination of probationary employees at OPM. All three are political appointees and, as I\n\nunderstand it, they do not have civil service staff assisting them in this process. OPM was\n\ncommunicating these directives to the political appointees at Treasury, including Mr. York and\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who were passing the directives down to Mr. Norris and the\n\nother Human Capital Officers at Treasury agencies.\n\n       11.      To comply with OPM\u2019s directive to Treasury, my office pulled an initial list of\n\n17,000 probationary employees. We carved out employees from the Taxpayer Services, Taxpayer\n\nAdvocate, and IT departments, all of whom are essential personnel for tax filing season, as well as\n\nsome other categories of workers, resulting in a list of approximately 6,700 probationary\n\nemployees located around the country.\n\n       12.      Mr. Norris specifically instructed me and the other Human Capital Officers at\n\nTreasury that OPM would not allow us to exempt military veterans from the probationary\n\nterminations.\n\n       13.      My colleagues and I asked Mr. Norris what the termination letter for affected\n\nprobationary employees should consist of, and they informed me that OPM had drafted a letter,\n\n\n\n\n                                            JA234\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 4-37        Filed 03/07/25     Page 5 of 9\n\n\n\nTreasury made a few modifications, and that we were instructed to send this letter out. My office\n\nwas not permitted to make any changes to the letter. I refused to sign these termination notices, as\n\ndid Acting IRS Commissioner Doug O\u2019Donnell, so the termination notices were sent on February\n\n14, 2025 from a generic agency email to approximately 6,700 probationary employees at IRS,\n\nterminating their employment immediately.\n\n       14.     My office did not review or consider the actual job performance or conduct of any\n\nIRS probationary employee when issuing the termination notices. I also know that Treasury did\n\nnot review or consider the actual job performance or conduct of any IRS probationary employee\n\nwhen issuing the termination notices. I know this because this fact was discussed openly in\n\nmeetings. Practically speaking, it would take weeks or months to evaluate the job performance of\n\n6,700 probationary employees.\n\n       15.     Although I did not review the personnel files of any of these employees, it is a\n\nstatistical certainty in my mind that many of the nearly 6,700 probationary employees terminated\n\nby IRS had written documentation of positive performance.\n\n       16.     The OPM directive, communicated to me by Mr. York through Mr. Norris, was\n\nplainly an effort to reduce headcount and did not involve any evaluation of the job performance of\n\nprobationary employees.\n\n       17.     To me, the mass firings were clearly a Reduction in Force (\u201cRIF\u201d) without\n\nfollowing the rules for a RIF.\n\n       18.     To ensure that a RIF is conducted lawfully, an agency spends approximately 12 to\n\n18 months simply preparing for the RIF. See Exhibit 1 (Reduction in Force (RIF) Fact Sheet). An\n\nagency\u2019s Human Capital office begins by spending months verifying that personnel records are\n\ncomplete and free of errors. This is to ensure, for example, that veterans\u2019 status is correctly\n\n\n\n\n                                             JA235\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 4-37         Filed 03/07/25      Page 6 of 9\n\n\n\nannotated and that employees\u2019 service date computations are correct, among other things. The\n\nagency then typically takes months to determine the competitive area where the RIF will take\n\nplace. After these and other initial steps are taken, the agency will then try to reassign employees\n\nto other divisions or give them an opportunity to take an early retirement offer instead of separating\n\nthem in a RIF. These effort are made in close consultation with the managers in these offices. The\n\nRIF is the last step of the process, which must be done in accordance with required RIF procedures,\n\nincluding providing employees and their unions with notice. Notice to employees is critical\n\nbecause it allows them to make preparations and minimize the devastating impact of losing a job.\n\nI understand that an agency is also required to give notice to the state where an affected employee\u2019s\n\nduty station was located.\n\n       19.     On or about February 25, 2025, Acting IRS Commissioner O\u2019Donnell retired, and\n\nMelanie Krause, previously the Chief Operating Officer of the IRS, became Acting Commissioner\n\nof the IRS.\n\n       20.     On Friday, February 28, 2025, Gavin Kliger, a member of the Department of\n\nGovernment Efficiency (DOGE), arrived at the IRS around 12:30, along with Sam Cronus a new,\n\nunpaid political advisor to Tom Krause, a Treasury political appointee. Mr. Kliger demanded that\n\nMr. Cronus be issued an IRS personal identity verification card and information technology\n\nequipment immediately. I informed the Chief of Staff via email that that Mr. Kliger\u2019s request\n\nwould not be completed that day because: (1) the necessary paperwork to onboard him was not\n\nprepared because we did not have advance notice that he was starting; (2) any new IRS employee\n\nmust undergo a tax check and that can take up to 10 days to complete; and (3) Treasury is required\n\nto comply with a Temporary Restraining Order issued by the U.S. District Court for the Southern\n\n\n\n\n                                              JA236\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 4-37        Filed 03/07/25     Page 7 of 9\n\n\n\nDistrict of New York, which limits access to Treasury systems without prior approval and written\n\nagreement executed by our General Counsel.\n\n       21.     Accordingly, I scheduled Mr. Cronus\u2019 onboarding to take place as soon as possible,\n\nwhich was the next business day, Monday, March 3, 2025 at 8:00 a.m. I notified my staff that we\n\nhad a political appointee to process for onboarding and to be ready with the appropriate paperwork.\n\nI also notified our General Counsel\u2019s office to arrange for an ethics briefing and the Chief Privacy\n\nofficer to request a briefing for Mr. Cronus on the confidentiality and information security\n\nrequirements of Internal Revenue Code section 6103.\n\n       22.     On Saturday, March 1, 2025, Acting Commissioner Krause contacted me and\n\nrequested that I complete a tax check on Mr. Cronus, the DOGE employee, that day. I do not\n\npersonally conduct the tax check, and the tax checks are not performed on the weekends. I\n\ninformed Ms. Krause that we could conduct it on Monday morning. Ms. Krause stated that I was\n\nbeing uncooperative and that, in essence, I was expected to jump if DOGE told me to jump. I\n\nsimply responded that we were following established processes and protocols.\n\n       23.     On the morning of Monday, March 3, 2025, we had arranged for Mr. Cronus, the\n\nDOGE employee, to undergo the tax check at 8:00am, but he did not arrive at our offices until\n\n10:45am. That afternoon, Acting Commissioner Krause placed me on administrative leave with\n\nthe intention of terminating my employment as a career Senior Executive. Acting Commissioner\n\nKrause gave three reasons for placing me on administrative leave pending termination: (1) that I\n\ndid not effectively implement the termination of probationary employees; (2) that I did not\n\nimplement the deferred resignation program correctly; and (3) that I was insubordinate and\n\nuncooperative with the DOGE employees.\n\n\n\n\n                                             JA237\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB         Document 4-37        Filed 03/07/25     Page 8 of 9\n\n\n\n       24.    Following my meeting with Acting Commissioner Krause, security escorted me to\n\nmy office where I was asked to turn over my government ID, my government issued laptop,\n\niPhone, iPad, and parking pass. I was then escorted to my car and left the premises by 3:00 PM.\n\n\n\n\n        March 6, 2025\nDated: _______________                              Signed: ___________________________\n                                                           Traci DiMartini\n\n                                                    *A copy of the signature page bearing an\n                                                    original signature is attached hereto.\n\n\n\n\n                                           JA238\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB   Document 4-37   Filed 03/07/25   Page 9 of 9\n\n\n\n\n                             JA239\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB   Document 4-38   Filed 03/07/25   Page 1 of 3\n\n\n\n\n                  Exhibit ,,\n\n\n\n\n                             JA240\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 4-38        Filed 03/07/25      Page 2 of 3\n\n\n\n                               UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n                               FOR THE DISTRICT OF MARYLAND\n\n\n\n MARYLAND; et al.,\n\n                 Plaintiffs,\n\n         v.

LIERMAN, declare as follows:\n   1. I am a resident of the State of Maryland. I am over the age of 18 and have personal\nknowledge of all the facts stated herein, except to those matters stated upon information and belief;\nas to those matters, I believe them to be true. If called as a witness, I could and would testify\ncompetently to the matters set forth below.\n   2. I currently serve as the Comptroller of Maryland (\u201cComptroller\u201d).\n   3. The Comptroller is the chief fiscal officer of the State. My duties as Comptroller include\nthe following: having the general superintendence of the fiscal affairs of the State; digesting and\npreparing plans for the improvement and management of the revenue and for the support of the\npublic credit; preparing and reporting estimates of the revenue and expenditures of the State;\nsuperintending and enforcing the prompt collection of all taxes and revenue; adjusting and settling,\non terms prescribed by law, with delinquent collectors and receivers of taxes and State revenue;\npreserving all public accounts; and deciding on the forms of keeping and stating accounts. See MD\nConstitution, Art. 6, \u00a7 2.\n   4. Maryland\u2019s budget relies in large part on personal income tax revenue. In fiscal year 2024,\npersonal income tax revenue represented 55% of our general fund revenues.\n   5. Although unemployed individuals receiving unemployment benefits generally pay income\ntax on their benefits, the benefits paid are less than the amount the individuals earned when they\n\n\n\n\n                                              JA241\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 4-38        Filed 03/07/25      Page 3 of 3\n\n\n\nwere fully employed, and therefore the taxes paid are generally less than the taxes paid during their\nemployment.\n   6. Accordingly, any firings and layoffs causing Marylanders to become unemployed will\nnecessarily result in a significant decrease to Maryland income tax revenues.\n   7. Upon information and belief, I understand that hundreds of federal employees who reside\nin Maryland and were recently terminated by the federal government have applied for\nunemployment benefits.\n   8. Accordingly, the terminations that have occurred to date and the anticipated continuation\nof these terminations will cause significant decreases in Maryland\u2019s income tax revenues.\n   9. Approximately 250,000 federal workers reside in Maryland.\n   10. Beyond the loss of income tax revenue, the sudden and significant increase of newly\nunemployed workers will have serious negative effects on Maryland\u2019s labor market. These effects\ninclude extended periods of unemployment, downward pressure on wages, and the migration of\nresidents out of the State.\n\n\n\nExecuted on March 6, 2025, at Annapolis, Maryland.\n\n\n\n\n                                              _____________________________________\n                                              BROOKE E.

I am a resident of the State of Colorado. I am over the age of 18 and have\n\npersonal knowledge of all the facts stated herein, except to those matters stated upon information\n\nand belief; as to those matters, I believe them to be true. If called as a witness, I could and would\n\ntestify competently to the matters set forth below.\n\n       2.      I am currently employed by the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment\n\n(CDLE) as the Director of the Colorado Division of Unemployment Insurance.\n\n       3.      CDLE is responsible for connecting job seekers to great jobs; protecting\n\nworkplaces and communities with a variety of consumer protection and safety programs;\n\nassisting workers injured on the job; ensuring fair labor practices; providing accurate economic\n\ndata; and helping those who lost their jobs by providing temporary wage replacement. CDLE\n\nadministers a wide range of federally funded workforce and training programs, including but not\n\n\n\n\n                                             JA244\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 4-39       Filed 03/07/25     Page 3 of 9\n\n\n\nlimited to those authorized by the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), that are\n\nvital to Colorado\u2019s economic stability and workforce development.\n\n       4.       As Director of the Colorado Division of Unemployment Insurance, I have access\n\nto records that detail the state of Colorado\u2019s labor market, including claims for unemployment\n\nbenefits, and the allocation and distribution of funding received by CDLE.\n\n       5.       The ongoing mass-layoff of federal workers is irreparably harming Colorado in\n\nseveral ways.\n\nRapid Response Team Expenditures\n\n       6.       CDLE oversees Rapid Response, a coordinated, multiple-partner strategy to\n\nprovide immediate assistance to Coloradans subject to mass layoffs. Rapid Response is the state\n\nentity responsible for conducting outreach and providing unemployment services required by the\n\nfederal Workforce Investment Act of 1998, as amended by the federal Workforce Innovation and\n\nOpportunity Act of 2014.\n\n       7.       The purpose of Rapid Response is to reduce reliance on public benefit systems\n\nsuch as unemployment insurance; to promote economic recovery and vitality by developing an\n\nongoing, comprehensive approach to identify, plan for, and respond to layoffs and dislocations;\n\nand to prevent or minimize the impact of mass layoffs on workers, businesses, and communities.\n\n       8.       At the core of our Rapid Response team is CDLE\u2019s Dislocated Worker Unit\n\n(DSU). DSU works in close partnership with other stakeholders, such as the state\u2019s ten Local\n\nWorkforce Development Areas, which provide localized assistance to both employers and\n\nemployees across the state.\n\n       9.       When notified of a forthcoming mass layoff, Rapid Response will quickly provide\n\ninformational resources and reemployment services for workers, including but not limited to:\n\n\n\n\n                                            JA245\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 4-39          Filed 03/07/25      Page 4 of 9\n\n\n\ninformation and support for filing Unemployment Insurance (UI) claims, information on the\n\nimpacts of layoffs on health coverage or other benefits, information on and referral to career\n\nservices, reemployment-focused workshops and services, and occupational training.\n\n        10.     In addition, Rapid Response will contact affected businesses to collect, verify, and\n\ndistribute information regarding Rapid Response activities. Rapid Response will also coordinate\n\nwith state staff and local workforce area staff at the American Job Centers located in the affected\n\narea to provide support for the affected workers. The Division of Unemployment Insurance will\n\nmobilize to streamline and expedite the processing of unemployment claims.\n\n        11.     Rapid Response also facilitates connections to partner agencies and organizations\n\nto ensure their ability to provide assistance to terminated workers and their families, such as\n\nhome heating assistance, legal aid, and financial advice.\n\n        12.     I understand that, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d)(3)(A)(i), the federal\n\nGovernment is required to notify \u201cthe State or entity designated by the State to carry out rapid\n\nresponse activities under section 134(a)(2)(A) of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998\u201d of a\n\nplan for a reduction-in-force (RIF) of federal employees, generally at least 60 days in advance of\n\nany proposed RIF.\n\n        13.     The notice required by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d)(3)(A) is intended to trigger rapid\n\nresponse activities since it is explicitly to be given to the state entity required to carry out rapid\n\nresponse activities.\n\n        14.     To the best of my knowledge, neither CDLE, Rapid Response, nor any other\n\nentity in the Colorado State Government has received notice of a federal reduction in force at any\n\nfederal agency.\n\n\n\n\n                                               JA246\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 4-39        Filed 03/07/25      Page 5 of 9\n\n\n\n       15.     Yet, as detailed more below, since January 21, 2025, CDLE has already received\n\n544 claims from ex-federal workers who list a federal agency as their last employer. This is\n\ncompared to 135 claims from ex-federal workers who list a federal agency as their last employer\n\nfor the same time period one year ago. CDLE has also seen a significant uptick of new\n\nunemployment claims of ex-federal employees just in the last two weeks, with an approximate\n\nrange of 20-30 new such claims every day. CDLE has been receiving substantially more\n\nunemployment claims of ex-federal employees than in past years.\n\n       16.     Because our Rapid Response team has received no notice of federal RIFs, CDLE\n\nhas been required to dedicate significantly more staff, resources, and expenditures to fulfill our\n\nstatutory mission. In light of the increasing claims for unemployment benefits and the public\n\nreporting about ongoing and forthcoming federal layoffs, Rapid Response has been attempting to\n\ncompensate for the lack of notice and information regarding the terminations. Rapid Response\n\nhas been conducting substantial outreach across the state, including issuing revised guidance\n\ndocuments. CDLE has been conducting town halls and engaging with elected officials and other\n\nstakeholders to provide information and engage with individuals regarding the resources\n\ndescribed above. We have internally had to divert staff from other critical tasks to monitor and\n\ndevelop reporting dashboards in response to these unprecedented federal terminations. These\n\nsubstantial efforts and expenditures would not have been necessary had the federal agencies\n\nproperly provided the notice required by law.\n\nHarms Related to the Colorado Unemployment Insurance Act\n\n       17.     CDLE, through the Division of Unemployment Insurance, also manages claims\n\nfor unemployment benefits by individuals formerly employed to work in Colorado.\n\n\n\n\n                                             JA247\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 4-39        Filed 03/07/25      Page 6 of 9\n\n\n\n       18.     The statutory framework of the Colorado Unemployment Insurance Act (the Act)\n\nis primarily governed by the Colorado Employment Security Act (CESA), which is codified at\n\nTitle 8, Sections 8-70-101 through 8-82-105, C.R.S.\n\n       19.     Colorado is party to an agreement with the United States Secretary of Labor,\n\nwherein the Secretary shall pay, as an agent of the United States, Unemployment Compensation\n\nfor Federal Employees (UCFE) pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8502(a). Generally, the federal\n\nGovernment is required to reimburse Colorado for unemployment benefits provided to former\n\nfederal employees, in the same amount, on the same terms, and subject to the same conditions\n\nwhich would be payable to them under the Act. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8502(b).

The current situation involving the mass termination of probationary federal\n\nemployees is causing, and will continue to cause, significant harms to Colorado associated with\n\nthe processing of unemployment claims. Many federal employees received termination notices\n\nsuggesting that they were fired for performance reasons, for example, because their performance\n\nhas not been adequate to justify further employment at the federal agency. As a result, the\n\nDivision of Unemployment Insurance is required to investigate and make findings whether these\n\nindividuals are eligible for benefits when, as noted above, Colorado state law limits benefits to\n\nthose who are unemployed through no fault of their own. These inquiries are often resource\n\nintensive and will require the Division to make individualized determinations in each case as to\n\nthe real reasons for the termination.\n\n       28.      The resources necessary to undertake these individualized investigations for\n\nformer federal employees is a substantial burden on CDLE. It will cause the diversion of staffing\n\nto investigate these claims. This will likely cause delays and backlogs for other unemployment\n\nclaims within the state. Colorado will be required to expend these substantial additional\n\nresources with no guarantee that it will be reimbursed for these expenses by the federal\n\ngovernment.\n\n\n\n\n               Executed on March 6, 2025, at Denver, Colorado.\n\n\n\n\n                                         ____/s/*_______\n                                         Philip Spesshardt\n                                         Director, Colorado Division of Unemployment Insurance\n\n               *A copy of the signature page bearing an original signature is attached hereto.\n\n\n\n\n                                             JA250\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB   Document 4-39   Filed 03/07/25   Page 9 of 9\n\n\n\n\n                             JA251\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB   Document 33-1   Filed 03/12/25   Page 1 of 7\n\n\n\n\n                  Exhibit M\n\n\n\n\n                             JA252\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB         Document 33-1       Filed 03/12/25     Page 2 of 7\n\n\n\n                             UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n                             FOR THE DISTRICT OF MARYLAND\n\n\n       STATE OF MARYLAND, ET AL.,\n\n                    Plaintiffs,\n                                                              Case No.: 1:25-cv-\n                        v.\n\n     UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF\n         AGRICULTURE, ET AL.,\n\n                   Defendants.\n\n\n\n\n                             DECLARATION OF\n\nI,             , swear under penalty of perjury:\n\n       1.

On February 14, 2025, I received by email a notice signed by                  that\n\nHHS was terminating my employment, effective March 14, 2025. See Exhibit 1.

If I had more warning, I would have started looking for a new\n\nposition immediately.\n\n       7.       I know of many other probationary employees at HHS that received this same\n\ntermination letter. I understand that 37 probationary employees within the\n\n              were terminated on or around February 14, 2025. I also understand that 180\n\nprobationary employees across all divisions and bureaus of           were terminated on or around\n\nFebruary 14, 2025.\n\n       8.       I am now unemployed, and I have not received any severance pay following my\n\nabrupt termination. I have applied for unemployment insurance benefits with the Maryland\n\ngovernment.\n\n       9.       I can no longer afford to support the local economy in the same way. If I do not\n\nfind a job in the next few months, I will likely need to move in with my parents or other family\n\nmembers.\n\n       10.      As a resident, I pay income taxes to Maryland. Each pay period, HHS withheld\n\nand paid income taxes from my paycheck to the Maryland government.\n\n       11.      Before I was terminated, my job duties as a\n\n\n\n\n       12.

Additionally, on February 5, 2025,\n\njust nine days before I first learned that I was being terminated, my supervisor had informed me\n\nthat she had submitted paperwork to promote me from the                                   I was\n\ntold that my promotion would be effective February 23, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nDated: March 6, 2025\n\n\n                                                    *A copy of the signature page bearing an\n                                                    original signature is attached hereto.\n\n\n\n\n                                                3\n\n\n                                            JA262\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB   Document 33-2   Filed 03/12/25   Page 5 of 11\n\n\n\n\n                             JA263\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB   Document 33-2   Filed 03/12/25   Page 6 of 11\n\n\n\n\n                  EXHIBIT 1\n\n\n\n\n                             JA264\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB   Document 33-2   Filed 03/12/25   Page 7 of 11\n\n\n\n\n                              JA265\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB   Document 33-2   Filed 03/12/25   Page 8 of 11\n\n\n\n\n                             JA266\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB   Document 33-2   Filed 03/12/25   Page 9 of 11\n\n\n\n\n                  EXHIBIT 2\n\n\n\n\n                              JA267\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB               Document 33-2           Filed 03/12/25        Page 10 of 11\n\n        DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH & HUMAN SERVICES                                          Office of the Secretary\n\n\n                                                                                       Washington, D.C. 20201\n\n\n                                             February 14, 2025\n\n\n\n      MEMORANDUM FOR\n\n\n      FROM:\n\n\n\n\n      SUBJECT:                    Notification of Termination During Probationary Period\n      REFERENCES:                 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7511\n                                  5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3321(a)\n                                  5 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 315.803 and 804\n                                  5 C.F.R. \u00a7 316.304\n\n             This is to provide notification that I am removing you from your position of\n                             and federal service consistent with the above references.\n             On 2/25/2024, the agency appointed you to the position of\n                    As documented on your appointment Standard Form 50 (SF-50), your\n      appointment is subject to a probationary/trial period.

My name is               and I am an adult resident of Washington, D.C.\n\n       2.      I began working for the U.S. Agency for International Development (\u201cUSAID\u201d)\n\n                                                                                          on\n\napproximately December 2, 2024. My duty station was Washington, D.C.\n\n       3.      I am an active duty Air Force veteran. I currently serve in the Air Force Reserves.\n\n       4.      From the date of my hire, USAID classified me as a probationary employee. My\n\nprobationary period was one year, or until approximately December 1, 2025.\n\n       5.      On February 24, 2025, I received by email a memorandum signed by\n\n                                                                          that USAID was\n\nterminating my employment, effective immediately, on the basis that \u201cit is in the best interest of\n\nthe U.S. Government.\u201d See Exhibit 1. The memorandum did not identify any issue with my\n\nperformance or conduct, nor did it identify any conditions arising before my appointment to\n\njustify my termination.\n\n                                                 1\n\n\n                                             JA271\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 33-3        Filed 03/12/25      Page 3 of 9\n\n\n\n       6.      The February 24, 2025 termination notice from                       was the first I\n\nhad learned of my termination. If I had more warning, I would have started looking for a new\n\nposition immediately.\n\n       7.      I am now unemployed, aside from my periodic reservist duties. I plan to apply\n\nfor unemployment insurance benefits with the D.C. government if I am eligible.\n\n       8.      I can no longer afford to support the local economy in the same way due to the\n\nsudden termination. For example, I have canceled plans to eat out at restaurants and order\n\ndelivery, and will need to drive outside of the city to Maryland or Virginia for cheaper groceries.\n\nI will likely not renew my fitness memberships and class passes after February, and have to cut\n\ndown on all other recreational expenses, dissuading me patronizing any establishments for\n\ngatherings with my friends and community members. I also will likely have to put off upcoming\n\nhealthcare needs for my pets. Prior to my termination, I was also planning to buy property within\n\nD.C., with the help of my Veteran Affairs benefits, but am no longer searching due to the\n\nunexpected termination of my job.\n\n       9.      If I do not find a new job in the District in the next few months, I will need to\n\nrelocate out of the District, and may need to terminate my rental lease early to do so.\n\n       10.     Prior to my termination, my job duties\n\n\n\n\n                                                 2\n\n\n                                             JA272\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB         Document 33-3        Filed 03/12/25     Page 4 of 9\n\n\n\n       11.\n\n\n\n       12.    As a resident of the District of Columbia, I pay income taxes to the District. Each\n\npay period, USAID withheld and paid income taxes from my paycheck to the District\n\ngovernment.\n\n       13.    I received one midterm review during my two and a half months at USAID,\n\nduring which my supervisor and I discussed my progress on my performance plan and we both\n\nexecuted a Form AID 462-1, acknowledging we conducted this review. My supervisor gave me\n\npositive feedback regarding my performance.\n\n       14.    I am in contact with many other probationary employees at USAID that received\n\nthis same termination letter. I believe my agency terminated roughly 200 probationary employees\n\non February 24, 2025.\n\n\n\nDated: March 5, 2025\n\n\n\n\n                                               3\n\n\n                                           JA273\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB   Document 33-3   Filed 03/12/25   Page 5 of 9\n\n\n\n\n                             JA274\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB   Document 33-3   Filed 03/12/25   Page 6 of 9\n\n\n\n\n                  Exhibit 1\n\n\n\n\n                             JA275\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB   Document 33-3   Filed 03/12/25   Page 7 of 9\n\n\n\n\n                             JA276\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB        Document 33-3        Filed 03/12/25     Page 8 of 9\nProbationary Termination\nPage 2\n\n       whichever is later.

If you believe that this action is being taken against you because of reprisal for\n       whistleblowing activity, you may seek corrective action under subchapters II and III of\n       5 U.S.C. Chapter 12, by filing a complaint with the Office of Special Counsel (OSC).\n       After a complaint is filed with OSC, you may file an Individual Right of Action (IRA)\n       appeal with the MSPB.\n\n       PLEASE READ CAREFULLY BEFORE CHOOSING AN OPTION UNDER THIS SECTION:\n\n       If you choose option 3 above and first seek corrective action by filing a complaint with\n       OSC, your subsequent appeal to the MSPB will be deemed an IRA appeal. Pursuant to\n       5 C.F.R. Section 1209.2, you will be limited to the rights associated with an IRA appeal.\n       Specifically, the MSPB will only consider whether you have demonstrated that one or\n       more whistleblowing disclosures was a contributing factor in the Agency taking this\n       personnel action against you, and if so, whether the Agency has demonstrated by\n       clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken this personnel action in the\n       absence of the protected disclosure or disclosures. You may not raise affirmative\n       defenses other than reprisal for whistleblowing activities, such as claims of\n       discrimination or harmful procedural error.\n\n\n\n\n                                          JA277\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB         Document 33-3       Filed 03/12/25     Page 9 of 9\nProbationary Termination\nPage 3\n\n       If you have any questions about your appeal rights, you may contact HCTM/ELR at\nhctm.elr@usaid.gov.

My name is                and I am an adult resident of Washington, D.C.\n\n       2.      I began working for the U.S. Department of Housing & Urban Development\n\n(\u201cHUD\u201d) as\n\n                                         on approximately January 13, 2025.

My\n\nprobationary period was one year, or until approximately January 12, 2026.\n\n       4.      On February 14, 2025, I received by email a Notice of Termination from\n\n            stating that HUD was terminating my employment, effective immediately, \u201cin order\n\nto promote the efficiency of the federal service in accordance with the priorities of the\n\nAdministration.\u201d See Exhibit 1.

The February 14, 2025 Notice was the first I had learned of my termination. If I\n\nhad more warning, I would have started looking for a new position immediately.\n\n        6.     I know of many other probationary employees at HUD that received this same\n\ntermination letter. I believe HUD terminated dozens of probationary employees on or around\n\nFebruary 14, 2025.\n\n        7.     I am now unemployed. I plan to apply for unemployment insurance benefits with\n\nthe D.C. government if I am eligible. If I do not find a job soon, I may need to apply for\n\nMedicaid benefits and food stamps.\n\n        8.     I can no longer afford to support the local economy in the same way. I have\n\nstopped eating out at restaurants, going to concerts, spend less money in general because I need\n\nto save it.\n\n        9.     As a resident of the District of Columbia, I pay income taxes to the District. Each\n\npay period, HUD withheld and paid income taxes from my paycheck to the District government.\n\n        10.

Failure to return government property may result in a deduction of your\npaycheck. Any personal items left behind in your work area will be mailed to your current address of\nrecord. Please let your supervisor know if you have changed your mailing address.\n\nIf you had opted into the Deferred Resignation Program by messaging OPM prior to its closing at 7:20pm\nET on February 12, 2025, you will receive an Agreement to sign and will be allowed to resign or retire in\naccordance with the terms of the program. If you believe you opted into the program and are receiving\nthis notice in error, please contact DeferredResignationQuestions@HUD.Gov for verification. Please\nannotate Probationary Verification in the subject line.\n\nYou are advised that you do not have a right to reply to this personnel action or to grieve your termination\nunder either the administrative or negotiated grievance procedure. However, if you believe you received\nthis notice in error because you are not currently in a trial period, please send an e-mail to:\nProbationaryNotice@hud.gov with the subject \u201cVerification of Probationary Status.\u201d\n\nIf you believe that the Department discriminated against you on the basis of your race, color, religion, sex,\nnational origin, age, disability, genetic information, and/or reprisal, you may file a complaint of\ndiscrimination. In order to pursue this matter through the discrimination complaints process, you must\n\n\n\n\n                                                 JA285\n\f          Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 33-4        Filed 03/12/25      Page 8 of 8\n\n\n\ncontact a HUD EEO Counselor within 45 days of the effective date of this adverse action. A HUD EEO\nCounselor may be contacted through the HUD Office of Departmental Equal Employment Opportunity\n(ODEEO) by telephone at (202) 708-3362 or by writing to:\n\n                              Department of Housing and Urban Development\n                              Director of EEO\n                              451 7th Street, S.W., Room 2102\n                              Washington, D.C. 20410\n\nShould you elect to file a complaint of discrimination, your complaint will be processed in accordance\nwith 29 CFR \u00a7 1614.\nIf you believe this termination is being taken against you in reprisal for acts covered under the\nWhistleblower Protection Enhancement Act, you may seek corrective action by filing a complaint with\nthe Office of Special Counsel (OSC) (see www.osc.gov). If you choose to file a complaint with OSC,\nand if OSC does not take corrective action, you may then file an Individual Right of Action (IRA)\nappeal with the MSPB. In an IRA appeal, the only issues before the MSPB are those listed in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\n1221(e), i.e., whether the appellant has demonstrated that a protected disclosure or protected activity was\na contributing factor in one or more covered personnel actions and, if so, whether the agency has\ndemonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action(s) in\nthe absence of the protected disclosure(s). Other than raising an affirmative defense of reprisal for\nwhistleblowing activities, other affirmative defenses, such as claims of discrimination or harmful\nprocedural error, may not be raised. In an IRA appeal that concerns an adverse action under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\n7512, the agency need not prove its charges, nexus, or the reasonableness of the penalty.\n\nYour election of one of these avenues of review will be considered final on the date any appeal or\ncomplaint is filed.\n\n\n\n\n                                                JA286\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB   Document 33-5   Filed 03/12/25   Page 1 of 10\n\n\n\n\n                   Exhibit Q\n\n\n\n\n                              JA287\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 33-5        Filed 03/12/25      Page 2 of 10\n\n\n\n                            UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n                            FOR THE DISTRICT OF MARYLAND\n\n\n      STATE OF MARYLAND, ET AL.,\n\n                   Plaintiffs,\n                                                               Case No.: 1:25-cv-\n                       v.\n\n     UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF\n         AGRICULTURE, ET AL.,\n\n                  Defendants.\n\n\n\n\n                            DECLARATION OF\n\nI,                swear under penalty of perjury,\n\n       1.      My name is                  and I am an adult resident of Washington, D.C.\n\n       2.      I began working for the Department of the Interior (\u201cDOI\u201d) as an\n\n                                                                  on approximately May 5,\n\n2024. My duty station was Washington, D.C.\n\n       3.      From the date of my hire, DOI classified me as a probationary employee. My\n\nprobationary period was one year, or until approximately May 5, 2025.\n\n       4.      On February 14, 2025, I received by email a notice signed by                  that\n\nDOI was terminating my employment immediately. It stated: \u201cThe Department has determined\n\nthat you have failed to demonstrate fitness or qualifications for continued employment because\n\nyour subject matter knowledge, skills, and abilities do not meet the Department\u2019s current needs.\u201d\n\nSee Exhibit 1. The notice did not identify any issue with my performance or conduct, nor did it\n\nidentify any conditions arising before my appointment to justify my termination.\n\n\n\n                                                1\n\n\n                                           JA288\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 33-5        Filed 03/12/25       Page 3 of 10\n\n\n\n        5.     The February 14, 2025 termination notice from                      was the first I had\n\nlearned of my termination. If I had more warning, I would have started looking for a new\n\nposition immediately.\n\n        6.     I know of several other probationary employees at Interior that received this same\n\ntermination letter. I believe DOI terminated dozens of other probationary employees on or\n\naround February 14, 2025.\n\n        7.     I am now unemployed. I may need to apply for unemployment insurance benefits\n\nwith the D.C. government in the coming weeks if I do not find a job.\n\n        8.     I can no longer afford to support the local economy in the same way. For\n\nexample, I am spending less on groceries, not eating out at restaurants, and spending less on\n\nrecreational activities. If I do not find a new job in the next few months, I will relocate out of the\n\nDistrict.\n\n        9.     As a resident of the District of Columbia, I pay income taxes to the District. Each\n\npay period, USAID withheld and paid income taxes from my paycheck to the District\n\ngovernment.\n\n        10.    I was a\n\n        11.    As an\n\n\n\n\n        12.    In the eight months I worked at Interior, I received one performance review, in\n\nNovember 2024.

My name is                    and I am an adult resident of                   MD.\n\n     2. I began working for the Department of Labor (\u201cDOL\u201d) as an\n\n\n\n               on approximately April 22, 2024. My duty station was Washington, D.C.\n\n     3. From the date of my hire, DOL classified me as a probationary employee. My\n\n        probationary period was one year, or until approximately April 21, 2025.\n\n     4. On February 20, 2025, I received by email a Notification of Termination During\n\n        Probationary Period (\u201cTermination Notice), signed by                    stating that DOL\n\n        was terminating my employment, effective March 7, 2025. The Termination Notice\n\n        states as the reason for my termination: \u201cThe Agency finds your further employment\n\n        would not be in the public interest.\u201d See Exhibit 1. The notice did not identify any issue\n\n        with my performance or conduct, nor did it identify any conditions arising before my\n\n        appointment to justify my termination.\n\n                                                 1\n\n\n                                             JA298\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 33-6      Filed 03/12/25     Page 3 of 7\n\n\n\n   5. The February 20, 2025 Termination Notice was the first I had learned of my termination.\n\n      If I had more warning, I would have started looking for a new position immediately.\n\n   6. I know of several other probationary employees at DOL that received this same\n\n      termination letter. I believe DOL terminated around 200 probationary employees on or\n\n      around February 20, 2025.\n\n   7. I am now unemployed. I plan to apply for unemployment insurance benefits with the\n\n      D.C. government and may also apply for Medicaid and SNAP benefits.\n\n   8. I can no longer afford to support the local economy in the same way. For example, I am\n\n      disabled and used to pay someone to help me around the house a couple hours per week,\n\n      something I can now no longer do. I will also need to reduce my discretionary income,\n\n      like going to the movies or buying new household items.\n\n   9. As a resident of Maryland, I pay income taxes to the state of Maryland. Each pay period,\n\n      DOL withheld and paid income taxes from my paycheck to the state of Maryland.\n\n   10. I was a\n\n   11. Before I was terminated, my job duties as\n\n\n\n\n   12. In the ten months I worked at DOL, I received one performance review in October 2024.\n\n      My performance rating was Outstanding.\n\nDated: March 4, 2025                               Signed:\n\n\n\n\n                                               2\n\n\n                                          JA299\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB   Document 33-6    Filed 03/12/25     Page 4 of 7\n\n\n\n                                    *A copy of the signature page bearing an\n                                    original signature is attached hereto.\n\n\n\n\n                                3\n\n\n                             JA300\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB   Document 33-6   Filed 03/12/25   Page 5 of 7\n\n\n\n\n                             JA301\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB   Document 33-6   Filed 03/12/25   Page 6 of 7\n\n\n\n\n                  Exhibit 1\n\n\n\n\n                             JA302\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB   Document 33-6   Filed 03/12/25   Page 7 of 7\n\n\n\n\n                             JA303\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB   Document 33-7   Filed 03/12/25   Page 1 of 10\n\n\n\n\n                   Exhibit S\n\n\n\n\n                             JA304\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 33-7        Filed 03/12/25      Page 2 of 10\n\n\n\n                            UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n                            FOR THE DISTRICT OF MARYLAND\n\n\n      STATE OF MARYLAND, ET AL.,\n\n                   Plaintiffs,\n                                                               Case No.: 1:25-cv-\n                       v.\n\n     UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF\n         AGRICULTURE, ET AL.,\n\n                  Defendants.\n\n\n\n\n                            DECLARATION OF\n\nI,                 swear under penalty of perjury,\n\n       1.      My name is                   and I am an adult resident of Washington, D.C.\n\n       2.      I began working for the General Service Administration (\u201cGSA\u201d) as a P\n\n                                                                                  on April 7,\n\n2024.

My\n\nprobationary period was one year, or until approximately April 6, 2025.\n\n       4.      On February 14, 2025, I received by email a notice signed by                     that\n\nGSA was terminating my employment, effective March 7, 2025, on the basis that                   did\n\nnot consider it \u201cin the best interest of the U.S. government\u201d to retain me. See Exhibit 1. The\n\nemail did not identify any issue with my performance or conduct, nor did it identify any\n\nconditions arising before my appointment to justify my termination.\n\n\n\n\n                                                1\n\n\n                                            JA305\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB         Document 33-7         Filed 03/12/25     Page 3 of 10\n\n\n\n        5.     The February 13, 2025 termination notice was the first I had learned of my\n\ntermination. If I had more warning, I would have started looking for a new position\n\nimmediately.\n\n        6.     I believe many other probationary employees at GSA that received this same\n\ntermination letter. I believe my agency terminated more than 100 probationary employees the\n\nweek of February 10, 2025.\n\n        7.     I will be unemployed after my termination effective date of March 7, 2025. I plan\n\nto apply for unemployment insurance benefits with the D.C. government.\n\n        8.     Because of my termination, I will not be able to support D.C.\u2019s local economy in\n\nthe same way. My family and I have had to scale back our spending significantly, including not\n\neating out at restaurants as often and shopping for groceries outside of D.C. where groceries are\n\ncheaper. We also will likely need to cancel my children\u2019s enrollment at a summer camp in the\n\nDistrict.\n\n        9.     As a resident of the District of Columbia, I pay income taxes to the District. Each\n\npay period, GSA withheld and paid income taxes from my paycheck to the District government.\n\n        10.    Before I was terminated, my job duties as\n\n\n\n\n        11.

I plan to apply for unemployment insurance benefits with\n\nthe D.C. government. I may need to apply for Medicaid and other public assistance programs.\n\n        8.      I can no longer afford to support the local economy of D.C. or Maryland in the\n\nsame way. I commuted into the District for work and paid for parking and lunch around my\n\noffice. I also frequently went out to restaurants in the District after work. On the weekends, I\n\nwas often in the District at restaurants, bars, clubs, and museums. Because I am now\n\nunemployed, I will be in the District much less often, both because I will no longer be\n\ncommuting to work and also because I will need to scale back my spending significantly.\n\n        9.      I will also need to scale back my spending significantly in Maryland. I am in the\n\nprocess of building a new house in Maryland and if I do not find a new job soon, I may not get\n\napproved for my mortgage or be able to afford mortgage payments.\n\n        10.

I began working for the U.S. Department of the Treasury as a\n\n                                                        on approximately October 6, 2024.

From the date of my hire, my agency classified me as a probationary employee.\n\nMy probationary period was one year, or until approximately October 5, 2025.\n\n       4.     On February 21, 2025, in a virtual meeting,\n\n                                 informed me that my agency was terminating my employment,\n\neffective March 8, 2025. They informed me that the reason for my termination was based on\n\n\u201ccurrent mission needs.\u201d They informed me that my agency would send me a termination notice,\n\nwhich I did not receive until March 3, 2025.\n\n       5.     The termination notice I received on March 3, 2025 was dated February 21, 2025\n\nand confirmed that my agency was terminating my employment, effective March 8, 2025,\n\n                                                  1\n\n\n                                             JA323\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 33-9         Filed 03/12/25      Page 3 of 9\n\n\n\nbecause \u201c[b]ased on . . . guidance [from the Office of Personnel Management] and in light of\n\ncurrent mission needs, the Agency finds that your continued employment at the Agency is not in\n\nthe public interest.\u201d See Exhibit 1. The notice did not identify any issue with my performance\n\nor conduct, nor did it identify any conditions arising before my appointment to justify my\n\ntermination.\n\n       6.      The February 21, 2025 meeting was the first notice I received of my termination.\n\nIf I had more warning, I would have started looking for a new position immediately.\n\n       7.      I know other probationary employees at my agency that received similar\n\ntermination letters.\n\n       8.      As of March 8, 2025, I will be unemployed.

I will no longer be able to afford to support the local economy in the same way.\n\nFor example, I will not be able to eat out at restaurants as often, go out for coffee, buy concert\n\ntickets at local music venues, or spend the same amount on groceries. I may need to relocate out\n\nof the District if potential employment opportunities require me to do so.\n\n       10.     As a resident of the District of Columbia, I pay income taxes to the District. Each\n\npay period, my agency withheld and paid income taxes from my paycheck to the District\n\ngovernment.\n\n       11.\n\n       12.

The termination notice cited the January 20, 2025 OPM memorandum called\n\nGuidance on Probationary Periods, Administrative Leave and Details and stated that \u201c[b]ased on\n\nthat guidance, taking into account your performance, and in light of current mission needs, the\n\nAgency finds that your continued employment at the Agency is not in the public interest.\u201d See\n\n\n\n                                                1\n\n\n                                            JA332\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 33-10          Filed 03/12/25      Page 3 of 7\n\n\n\nExhibit 1. The email did not identify any issue with my performance or conduct, nor did it\n\nidentify any conditions arising before my appointment to justify my termination.\n\n       5.      The February 20, 2025 termination notice was the first I had learned of my\n\ntermination. If I had more warning, I would have started looking for a new position\n\nimmediately.\n\n       6.      I am now unemployed. I plan to apply for unemployment insurance benefits with\n\nthe D.C. government.\n\n       7.      I can no longer afford to support the local economy in the same way. For\n\nexample, I will not be able to go out to restaurants as often. If I do not find a new job in the next\n\nfew months, I may need to relocate out of the District.\n\n       8.      As a resident of the District of Columbia, I pay income taxes to the District. Each\n\npay period, the IRS withheld and paid income taxes from my paycheck to the District\n\ngovernment.\n\n       9.

My name is                  and I am an adult resident of         Virginia.\n\n       2.      I began working for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (\u201cFEMA\u201d) as a\n\n\n\n            on approximately July 14, 2024. My duty station was Washington, D.C.\n\n       3.      From the date of my hire, FEMA classified me as a probationary employee.\n\nBecause I was a Presidential Management Fellow, my probationary period was two years, or\n\nuntil approximately July 13, 2026.\n\n       4.      On February 17, 2025, I received by email a notice signed by\n\nstating that FEMA was terminating my employment, effective immediately. The notice stated,\n\n\u201c[t]he Agency finds, based on your performance, that you have not demonstrated that your\n\nfurther employment at the Agency would be in the public interest.\u201d See Exhibit 1. It did not give\n\nany other reason.

I was not aware that I would be terminated prior to February 17, 2025. If I had\n\nmore warning, I would have started looking for a new position immediately.\n\n       6.      I know of many other probationary employees at FEMA that received this same\n\ntermination letter. I believe my agency terminated around 300 probationary employees on\n\nFebruary 18, 2025.\n\n       7.      I am now unemployed. I have applied for unemployment insurance benefits with\n\nthe D.C. government.\n\n       8.      Although I am a Virginia resident I regularly travel into D.C. and participate in\n\nthe local economy, I will not be able to do so in the same way. As a commuter to D.C., I spent\n\nmoney on lunch, parking, and Metro fare in the District, and I frequently went to D.C.\n\nrestaurants and sports events, all of which I will need to scale back significantly or stop entirely.\n\nI will likely not be able to renew my membership with the Washington Canoe Club.\n\n       9.

I began working for the Environmental Protection Agency (the \u201cEPA\u201d) as an\n\n                                        in\n\n                                                 on or about December 29, 2024. My duty station\n\nwas located in Boston, Massachusetts.\n\n       3.     From the date of my hire, the EPA classified me as a probationary employee. My\n\nprobationary period was one (1) year, or until approximately December 28, 2025.\n\n       4.     On Thursday, February 6, 2025, after about five (5) weeks on the job, I was\n\nsummoned to a meeting with regional EPA staff and told that I was being placed on administrative\n\nleave indefinitely. Shortly after that meeting, I received an email, from the email address\n\nNotice1@epa.gov, similarly advising me that I was being placed on administrative leave. I was\n\n\n\n\n                                                 1\n                                             JA384\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 33-17         Filed 03/12/25      Page 3 of 11\n\n\n\nadvised that my administrative leave was effective at the end of my tour of duty that same day. Job\n\nperformance was not given as a reason for me being placed on leave.\n\n       5.      I am aware of four (4) other probationary employees on my                 team who\n\nreceived the same email on February 6, 2024, placing them on administrative leave.\n\n       6.      On Tuesday, February 18, 2025, while on administrative leave, I received an email,\n\nsent to my personal email address from the email address Notice2@epa.gov, notifying me that I\n\nwas being terminated. The email referred appeals to                     Assistant General Counsel,\n\nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of General Counsel. The email stated as the reason\n\nfor my termination that I \u201cfailed to demonstrate fully [my] qualifications for continued\n\nemployment.\u201d See Exhibit 1. The email did not identify any issues with my performance or\n\nconduct, nor did it identify any conditions arising before my appointment to justify my termination.\n\n       7.      I am aware of other probationary employees on my                    team who were\n\nterminated on or around the same time as me.\n\n       8.      The February 18, 2025 termination notice to my personal email was the first I had\n\nlearned of my termination. I work in a small, highly specialized field and finding a job often takes\n\nseveral months, if not longer.\n\n       9.      I was receiving health insurance through my job at the EPA. After I was terminated,\n\nI filed for Medicaid benefits, which in Rhode Island is administered and managed by the Executive\n\nOffice of Health and Human Services (\u201cEOHHS\u201d).\n\n       10.     Since losing my job, I can no longer afford to support the local economy in the\n\nsame way. For example, I stopped eating out at restaurants and ordering food delivery. I also cut\n\ndown on all other recreational expenses, stopped patronizing local establishments for gatherings\n\nwith my friends and community members. I was also planning to buy property in Rhode Island or\n\n\n\n\n                                                 2\n                                             JA385\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 33-17         Filed 03/12/25      Page 4 of 11\n\n\n\nMassachusetts (I live in Rhode Island but on the Massachusetts border), but stopped searching due\n\nto the unexpected termination of my job. Additionally, it is likely that I will no longer be able to\n\npursue an advanced degree at the University of Rhode Island. I had been planning on taking classes\n\nin the Masters of Environmental Science and Management program part-time beginning Fall of\n\n2025. However, without stable income, I will no longer be able to afford tuition.\n\n       11.     Because I worked in Massachusetts, I also paid nonresident income taxes to\n\nMassachusetts. Each pay period, the EPA withheld and paid income taxes from my paycheck to\n\nthe Massachusetts government.\n\n       12.     Before I was terminated, my job duties as an\n\nat            included\n\n\n\n\n       13.     I was a                and earned a salary of approximately            per year.\n\n       14.     At the time of my termination, I had not undergone any performance reviews or\n\nevaluations, and in the six (6) weeks I was employed by the EPA, no one had communicated to me\n\nthat there were any problems with my performance.\n\nDated: March 6, 2025                                 Signed:\n\n\n                                                     *A copy of the signature page bearing an\n                                                     original signature is attached hereto.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 3\n                                             JA386\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB   Document 33-17   Filed 03/12/25   Page 5 of 11\n\n\n\n\n                              JA387\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB   Document 33-17   Filed 03/12/25   Page 6 of 11\n\n\n\n\n                   Exhibit 1\n\n\n\n\n                              JA388\n\f    Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB                 Document 33-17                 Filed 03/12/25   Page 7 of 11\n\n\nFrom:\nTo:\nSubject:        Fwd: Notification of Termination During Probationary Period\nDate:           Wednesday, March 5, 2025 5:13:36 PM\n\n\n\n\n[External email: Use caution with links and attachments]\n\n\n\n---------- Forwarded message ---------\nFrom: Notice2 <Notice2@epa.gov>\nDate: Tue, Feb 18, 2025 at 11:10 AM\nSubject: Notification of Termination During Probationary Period\nTo:\n\n\n\n\n      SUBJECT:                     Notification of Termination During Probationary Period\n\n      REFERENCES:                        5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7511\n\n                                   5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3321(a)\n\n                                   5 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 315.803 and 804\n\n                                   5 C.F.R. \u00a7 316.304\n\n\n\nThis is to provide notification that the Agency is removing you from your position and federal\nservice consistent with the above references.\n\n\n\nAs documented on your appointment Standard Form 50 (SF-50), your appointment is subject\nto a probationary/trial period.

You may be represented by an attorney or other\nrepresentative of your choice. If you believe this action was taken against you for\ndiscriminatory reasons, refer to the paragraph on EEOC. If you decide to file an appeal\nwith MSPB, you should notify the Board that the agency\u2019s point of contact for this\nappeal is Ochcofrontoffice@va.gov\n\n       Office of Special Counsel (OSC): If you elect to request corrective action by the\nOSC\u2019s Complaints Examining Unit (OSC Appeal Form) (https://osc.gov/), your\ncomplaint will be limited to a determination as to whether the agency took one or more\npersonnel actions against you in violation of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b) (prohibited personnel\n\n                                                                                      EXHIBIT A\n                                       JA412\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB         Document 33-19        Filed 03/12/25      Page 8 of 9\n\npractices). This can include, but is not limited to, claims of reprisal for whistleblowing\nand/or engaging in protected activity. If you are not a supervisor and you elect to request\ncorrective action with OSC, you will have waived your right to file an appeal with\nMSPB (if eligible), regarding the same matter, except as follows. If you are making a\ncovered claim of retaliation for engaging in certain protected activities, or for making\nprotected disclosures and OSC terminates its investigation and/or has not timely notified\nyou it will seek corrective action, you may have the right to file an individual right of\naction (IRA) appeal to the MSPB. Such an appeal will be limited to an adjudication of\nwhether you proved that your protected activity or disclosure was a contributing factor in\nthe effected action (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1214; 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1221). If you are a supervisor, you may\npursue remedies from MSPB and OSC concurrently.\n\n\n\n        If you are not a supervisor, whichever option you may choose to pursue\nregarding this action (an appeal to the MSPB, a request for corrective action to OSC, or a\ndiscrimination complaint), shall be considered an election by you to proceed under that\nappeal process. However, if you are not a supervisor, you may still concurrently file a\ncorrective action to OSC and a discrimination complaint. If you are a supervisor, you\nmay elect all three remedies concurrently.\n\n\n\n        Separating VA employees are required to return their PIV card to their PIV\nissuing office and their government furnished IT equipment and peripherals to the Office\nof Information Technology (OIT) for redeployment or disposition.\n\n\n\n       GFE Equipment\n\n       You will immediately take your equipment to the closest VA medical center or\n810 Vermont Avenue to turn in your IT equipment. The local OIT staff will collect all\nassigned government furnished equipment (GFE), including peripherals such as\nmonitors, docking stations, printers, etc.\n\n\n\n      Regardless of the original issuing site, all local IT teams will accept returned\nGFE and will adhere to local procedures for equipment accountability.\n\n\n\n       A return receipt for the equipment will be issued to the employee by local IT staff\nto acknowledge receipt of the employee\u2019s GFE and peripherals.\n\n       OIT Facility Requirements\n\n         Return any non-IT equipment, office and/or card keys, and PIV card to local\nfacility.\n\n       If there is lost equipment a report of survey needs to be completed before you\n\n                                                                                    EXHIBIT A\n                                     JA413\n\f    Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB         Document 33-19       Filed 03/12/25     Page 9 of 9\n\n     separate.\n\n\n\n\n            We appreciate your service to the Agency and wish you the greatest of success in\n     your future endeavors.

HALL:    Christopher Hall from the Federal Programs\n\n 4   Branch for the defendants as well.\n\n 5               THE COURT:     Good morning.\n\n 6          Plaintiffs, which include 19 states and the District of\n\n 7   Columbia have filed suit against, by my count, 41 defendants,\n\n 8   which include cabinet agencies, secretaries, other federal\n\n 9   agencies, heads of those agencies.          All this is detailed in the\n\n10   complaint, which is docketed at ECF Number 1.\n\n11          The States challenge the Government's termination of\n\n12   probationary federal employees.         The States allege violations of\n\n13   the Administrative Procedures Act.\n\n14          Importantly, at the outset, I think it's important to\n\n15   clarify that the States challenge the Federal Government's\n\n16   action, not so much for its impact on the federal employees\n\n17   themselves, who are not parties to this action, but for its\n\n18   impact on the States as states.         The States also allege that the\n\n19   Government's actions here were ultra vires.\n\n20          And beyond the complaint itself, the State has come to the\n\n21   court seeking the issuance of a temporary restraining order, a\n\n22   TRO.    Today's hearing, held just days after this lawsuit was\n\n23   initiated, is to address the petition or the motion for\n\n24   temporary restraining order, extraordinary early relief that is\n\n25   sometimes appropriate in the first days after a case has been\n\n\n              Kassandra L. McPherson, RPR - Federal Official Court Reporter\n\n                                        JA417\n\f                                  03/12/2025 TRO Hearing                             4\n\n\n 1   filed, but there are stringent standards that, of course, must\n\n 2   be met.\n\n 3       Sometimes temporary restraining order hearings occur ex\n\n 4   parte with just the party seeking the restraint present.                  The\n\n 5   rules permit that under certain circumstances, but that's never\n\n 6   ideal in our adversarial system of justice, it's always better\n\n 7   if the party against whom such an order might be entered has\n\n 8   notice and then is given the opportunity to be present, to be\n\n 9   heard, and so forth.\n\n10       So I'm grateful that, although we are here this morning to\n\n11   consider whether the Court should issue a TRO, we will hear from\n\n12   the defendants.       In fact, the defendants accepted the Court's\n\n13   invitation to submit a brief in anticipation of the hearing.\n\n14   They submitted their brief on Monday and the Court has carefully\n\n15   reviewed it, along with the other materials accumulated in the\n\n16   record.\n\n17       My understanding is that neither side intends to present\n\n18   evidence during this hearing.           Is that right, Ms. Williamson?\n\n19                MS. WILLIAMSON:        That is right, Your Honor.\n\n20                THE COURT:     Is that right, Mr. Hamilton?\n\n21                MR. HAMILTON:     Yes, Your Honor.\n\n22                THE COURT:     Okay.     So essentially then, we're going to\n\n23   entertain legal argument.\n\n24       I don't want to forget one technical detail that I think is\n\n25   important.      As we look down the road to the Court's treatment of\n\n\n               Kassandra L. McPherson, RPR - Federal Official Court Reporter\n\n                                           JA418\n\f                                  03/12/2025 TRO Hearing                       5\n\n\n 1   the information that's in the record, the Government -- the\n\n 2   States ask that certain affidavits be sealed, but the content of\n\n 3   those would seem to be quite important to the States' theory of\n\n 4   whether they're entitled to this emergency relief.\n\n 5       So I want the State, at the conclusion of this hearing, to\n\n 6   look carefully at those exhibits and ascertain, as I think they\n\n 7   can, how to redact them in such a way as to protect privacy,\n\n 8   perhaps to some extent anonymize the public version of such\n\n 9   documents and so forth.        And then, of course, leaving the full\n\n10   unredacted document on the record, but sealed.             Also submit, for\n\n11   the Court and the public to the docket, a redacted version.\n\n12       Can you take care of that Ms. Williamson?\n\n13                MS. WILLIAMSON:      Yes, Your Honor.\n\n14                THE COURT:     Let's try to get that done by the end of\n\n15   the day.\n\n16       All right.       The plaintiffs are the ones seeking this\n\n17   relief.     I'll hear from you first.        You may proceed.\n\n18                MS. WILLIAMSON:      Your Honor, this case concerns the\n\n19   defendant's failure to comply with a mandate from Congress that\n\n20   requires them to provide notice to plaintiff states before\n\n21   conducting any reductions in force.\n\n22       In this case, the primary issue is a statute; that's 5\n\n23   U.S.C. section 3502, and that statute leaves no doubt that the\n\n24   defendant agencies are required to provide notice before RIF,\n\n25   and that that notice must include particular things, including\n\n\n               Kassandra L. McPherson, RPR - Federal Official Court Reporter\n\n                                         JA419\n\f                                  03/12/2025 TRO Hearing                           6\n\n\n 1   the number of employees --\n\n 2                THE COURT:     Let's get to that in a minute.        But let's\n\n 3   get to a fundamental question first and that is, was this even a\n\n 4   RIF?     I think your opponents contend that they didn't conduct a\n\n 5   RIF.     They evaluated 21,000, 23,000, 24,000 employees and found\n\n 6   that their performance was deficient.           And, federal law is\n\n 7   crystal clear, if a probationary employee is not performing\n\n 8   adequately, they can be summarily discharged.\n\n 9                MS. WILLIAMSON:      Your Honor --\n\n10                THE COURT:     So first of all, is that your\n\n11   understanding of where your opponents are?            And if so, what's\n\n12   wrong with that theory?\n\n13                MS. WILLIAMSON:      That is my understanding of my friend\n\n14   on the other side's arguments, Your Honor, but this was a\n\n15   reduction in force.       This was multiple reductions in force\n\n16   simultaneously by 21 agencies over the course of just a few\n\n17   weeks.     And there's plenty of evidence in the record indicating\n\n18   that, Your Honor.\n\n19          I would start with the Executive Order from the President\n\n20   indicating a desire to effectively reduce the size of the\n\n21   Federal Government.\n\n22          The guidance from the Office of -- -- from OPM, the Office\n\n23   of Personnel Management, the initial guidance seeking a list of\n\n24   probationary employees and then later guidances in February,\n\n25   February 13th meetings and February 14th guidances to\n\n\n               Kassandra L. McPherson, RPR - Federal Official Court Reporter\n\n                                         JA420\n\f                               03/12/2025 TRO Hearing                         7\n\n\n 1   effectively fire those employees.\n\n 2       I would point, Your Honor, to declarations in the record\n\n 3   from Ms. DiMartini, who worked for the Treasury Department and\n\n 4   was in the meeting with OPM where OPM instructed her, without\n\n 5   reviewing personnel files, without making individualized\n\n 6   determinations to fire probationary employees.\n\n 7       I would point to the declaration of Mr. Grant, a former\n\n 8   employee of CNS, who attested to the same behavior.           Who\n\n 9   attested to OPM coming and requiring him effectively to fire\n\n10   probationary employees without any individualized consideration.\n\n11             THE COURT:     So let's pay a little bit of attention to\n\n12   a simple factual question, and that is, is there enough time\n\n13   that has passed that's plausible that 20,000 or more employees\n\n14   received individualized reviews of their performance prior to\n\n15   their termination?\n\n16             MS. WILLIAMSON:      Your Honor, I think that would be\n\n17   quite an undertaking to review that many files over the course\n\n18   of just a few weeks.\n\n19             THE COURT:     So your answer is no.\n\n20             MS. WILLIAMSON:      My answer is no, Your Honor, yes.\n\n21             THE COURT:     So I don't think we need to spend much\n\n22   more time on that issue, because that seems clear.\n\n23       But then, let's move to a more subtle question, and that\n\n24   is, who says they have to spend any time reviewing?           Who says\n\n25   that it has to be an actual review?        I read the Government's\n\n\n            Kassandra L. McPherson, RPR - Federal Official Court Reporter\n\n                                      JA421\n\f                               03/12/2025 TRO Hearing                         8\n\n\n 1   brief to say, we said we reviewed their performance.           Said it in\n\n 2   the letter.     And that's all that the statute actually requires.\n\n 3   There's no requirement that we actually review anyone's\n\n 4   performance.     In other words, there no requirement that the\n\n 5   statement be true, it's just that it be made.\n\n 6             MS. WILLIAMSON:      Your Honor, I think that would\n\n 7   effectively render OPM limitations on firing probationary\n\n 8   employees a nullity.     There are limits on when OPM can fire a\n\n 9   probationary employee, and that includes for circumstances where\n\n10   that employee's work performance or conduct during the period\n\n11   fails to demonstrate the fitness or qualification for that\n\n12   continued employment.\n\n13       And so without a -- if the government could simply assert\n\n14   that it had done -- had done some sort of evaluation and assert\n\n15   that it was performance-based, the statute itself would\n\n16   essentially -- or rather the regulation itself would essentially\n\n17   fall away.     If there's no criteria, if there's no actual\n\n18   evaluation required by the Government to determine that anyone\n\n19   is probationary, OPM's regulations, on this point, mean nothing.\n\n20             THE COURT:     Was every employee that was discharged\n\n21   told that their performance was deficient?\n\n22             MS. WILLIAMSON:      Absolutely not, Your Honor.        In fact,\n\n23   as the declarations of individual employees show, some of these\n\n24   employees were in the process of being promoted.          Many had\n\n25   received positive performance reviews from their supervisors,\n\n\n            Kassandra L. McPherson, RPR - Federal Official Court Reporter\n\n                                      JA422\n\f                                03/12/2025 TRO Hearing                          9\n\n\n 1   some even in the days leading up to their firing.            So no, Your\n\n 2   Honor, it's strains credulity to believe that each of these\n\n 3   employees who were fired, in fact, performed -- performed in\n\n 4   such a manner that -- their firing was warranted on performance.\n\n 5               THE COURT:    So please, continue.      I interrupted you.\n\n 6               MS. WILLIAMSON:     Yes, Your Honor.\n\n 7       As I was saying, Your Honor, the statute, 5 U.S.C. 3502,\n\n 8   makes clear that notice is required.         As we've discussed, Your\n\n 9   Honor, a RIF took place here, reduction in force.            None of the\n\n10   agency defendants suggest that they provided notice as required\n\n11   by the statute and as required by OPM's regulations.            That is\n\n12   not part of, as I understand it, my friend on the other side's\n\n13   argument.    And the states are suffering real and irreparable\n\n14   harm as a result of the failure to provide notice.\n\n15       THE COURT:     So tell me about that.       Because, obviously,\n\n16   that's significant just on the substance, but it's significant\n\n17   for standing.    What -- tell me how the States are being harmed\n\n18   in a concrete way right now, today and irreparably.\n\n19               MS. WILLIAMSON:     Yes, Your Honor.     I begin with the\n\n20   injury that is sort of the central injurious case and that's an\n\n21   informational injury.      The statute itself requires that certain\n\n22   information be provided to states.         The states use that\n\n23   information.    They, in fact, require that information to perform\n\n24   certain functions, including functions that Congress requires of\n\n25   them.\n\n\n             Kassandra L. McPherson, RPR - Federal Official Court Reporter\n\n                                       JA423\n\f                                  03/12/2025 TRO Hearing                       10\n\n\n 1       State rapid response agencies across the country need\n\n 2   information about the number of employees who are going to be\n\n 3   laid off in a mass lay-off like the ones that the defendants did\n\n 4   in order to provide up information about resources for job\n\n 5   hiring, information about unemployment benefits, to essentially\n\n 6   forestall harms that could befall the state -- that will befall\n\n 7   the state absent any sort of intervention.\n\n 8       So I'd point to the informational injury as the central\n\n 9   injury.     There's injury to the rapid response services --\n\n10                THE COURT:     But information injury can be a basis,\n\n11   there's no question about that, and the case law is elaborate,\n\n12   but ultimately clear on that issue.           But you've still got to\n\n13   show that it's concrete and real in the circumstances of this\n\n14   case.     So tell me about how that informational issue is\n\n15   impacting the plaintiff states last week when you filed this,\n\n16   today, et cetera, such that there's an imperative tact.\n\n17                MS. WILLIAMSON:      Yes, Your Honor.     The harm is\n\n18   manifest and it's set out in the many declarations that we\n\n19   supplied in the many plaintiff states in this case.\n\n20       I would focus though on the declaration from Secretary of\n\n21   Labor, Secretary Wu, who attested that her department has been,\n\n22   as she put it, forced to rely on public reporting and word of\n\n23   mouth to conduct their investigations; outreach to effective\n\n24   workers.     She has set out in her declaration that, because of\n\n25   the lack of notice of these reductions in force, that she's had\n\n\n               Kassandra L. McPherson, RPR - Federal Official Court Reporter\n\n                                         JA424\n\f                               03/12/2025 TRO Hearing                       11\n\n\n 1   to conduct extensive outreach that she normally would not\n\n 2   require her agency to conduct.       That her staff has had to\n\n 3   dedicate additional resources to fight -- essentially providing\n\n 4   the workforce development services that they would normally\n\n 5   provide given the information to --\n\n 6             THE COURT:     So in the first instance, in a nutshell,\n\n 7   you're saying they're entitled to be told what's going on and\n\n 8   they weren't, so they've had to expend resources in an effort to\n\n 9   find the truth, to search for evidence, and information as to\n\n10   what was occurring.\n\n11             MS. WILLIAMSON:      That's exactly right, Your Honor.\n\n12   And I would also point to just the use of services within the\n\n13   state by newly unemployed people who are residents of the state.\n\n14   At the time that Secretary Wu filed her declaration, just as one\n\n15   State's example, 813 former federal employees had applied for\n\n16   unemployment insurance benefits with the State of Maryland as of\n\n17   January 21st of this year.      As of today, that number is more\n\n18   than a thousand.    That's -- that is a 200 person increase over\n\n19   the course of just a week.\n\n20       And the issue is the state has no way of predicting\n\n21   precisely how many applications it's going to get, has no way of\n\n22   forestalling the harm that it is suffering, and it has no way of\n\n23   getting resources to the many people who were fired without\n\n24   notice, and without notice to the states to try to sort of get\n\n25   those people in -- into an employment situation, so they aren't\n\n\n            Kassandra L.

For\n\n 9   example, the Centers for Disease Control has a program where\n\n10   imbedded public health professionals work with local and state\n\n11   agencies.    And those personnel, although some of them have since\n\n12   been reinstated, those personnel were fired without notice\n\n13   requiring those state agencies to scramble.\n\n14               THE COURT:   If things went as you say they should\n\n15   have, the most these employees would have gotten 60 days notice.\n\n16   Really how much difference is there in terms of state tax\n\n17   revenues, when we consider this case isn't about reinstating\n\n18   federal employees for the rest of tax year 2025 and the\n\n19   indefinite future, but it would seem to be, at most, for a\n\n20   couple months.\n\n21               MS. WILLIAMSON:    It's --\n\n22               THE COURT:   Especially in light of the checkered case\n\n23   law on loss of tax revenue as a real cognizable harm and basis\n\n24   for standing.\n\n25               MS. WILLIAMSON:    It's true, Your Honor, that the\n\n\n            Kassandra L. McPherson, RPR - Federal Official Court Reporter\n\n                                      JA426\n\f                               03/12/2025 TRO Hearing                         13\n\n\n 1   injuries to state finances would be for a few months, except\n\n 2   that with notice to the states, the states rapid response\n\n 3   services may intervene, leading people to employment and such so\n\n 4   that they wouldn't lose.     They would continue to be earners who\n\n 5   are earning tax revenue for the state as well.\n\n 6              THE COURT:    You contend that that's part of the\n\n 7   purpose of the statute that Congress passed in terms of how RIFs\n\n 8   are supposed to be managed?\n\n 9              MS. WILLIAMSON:     I do, Your Honor.      I think Congress\n\n10   acted intentionally in requiring notice to the states.            The\n\n11   provision there was part of the Workforce Investment Act and\n\n12   then an amended version of that Act, the Workforce Innovation\n\n13   Opportunity Act of 2014.     And the whole purpose behind that Act\n\n14   was this sort of intervention, was creating programs at the\n\n15   state level to avoid loss of work, to intervene early when\n\n16   massive layoffs happened, of the sort that happened here.\n\n17              THE COURT:    Tell me about what your experts say about\n\n18   how a RIF is actually conducted when done according to the\n\n19   statute.\n\n20       I take it, from what you've submitted, that a RIF is\n\n21   seldom, if ever, sort of just suddenly implemented on day one\n\n22   with notice given and the terminations occur on day 60.            But\n\n23   instead, there are certain preparatory steps that have to be\n\n24   taken, that themselves necessarily consume time, competitive\n\n25   areas, and so forth.     Can you talk to me about that?\n\n\n            Kassandra L. McPherson, RPR - Federal Official Court Reporter\n\n                                      JA427\n\f                               03/12/2025 TRO Hearing                             14\n\n\n 1             MS. WILLIAMSON:      That's precisely right, Your Honor.\n\n 2   In order to conduct a RIF under the law, an agency has to\n\n 3   organize its personnel, rank them based on certain preferences.\n\n 4   There are preferences in the law, for example, for veterans.\n\n 5   There are preferences -- there's sort of an organization\n\n 6   depending on how long a person has spent in federal service or\n\n 7   in service as a veteran.     There are preferences that an agency\n\n 8   has to account for.    And then, there are competing areas where\n\n 9   different personnel sort of compete to remain in their\n\n10   positions.\n\n11       There's a -- as Your Honor set out, typically, as our\n\n12   experts are attested, RIFs take 12 to 18 months at times,\n\n13   certainly not a few days or a few weeks.\n\n14             THE COURT:     Please continue.\n\n15             MS. WILLIAMSON:      Yes, Your Honor.\n\n16       Defendants, again, provided no notice to the states.               As a\n\n17   result, the states are suffering injuries as we discussed.\n\n18   These injuries flow from the Defendant's conduct here.            I\n\n19   already addressed the categories of injury here, the\n\n20   informational injury, the injury to -- to the ability to provide\n\n21   unemployment benefits, the injury to state finances, the injury\n\n22   to state programmatic -- to state programs, the injury to our\n\n23   state rapid response programming that's required by law.               And\n\n24   these harms are irreparable.      There's no way for the states\n\n25   without an injunction by the Court to receive this money back,\n\n\n            Kassandra L. McPherson, RPR - Federal Official Court Reporter\n\n                                      JA428\n\f                                 03/12/2025 TRO Hearing                         15\n\n\n 1   to mitigate the harm other than through action by the court.\n\n 2   And it's mounting every single day as more and more people apply\n\n 3   for state benefits.\n\n 4               THE COURT:     But that might be a good argument in terms\n\n 5   of the ultimate claims you've brought.           I'm not sure how strong\n\n 6   that is in favor of entering a TRO, because presumably you\n\n 7   prevail later.     Even without a TRO, everything then gets sorted\n\n 8   out, including the payment of wages and then the payment of back\n\n 9   taxes.\n\n10               MS. WILLIAMSON:      Your Honor --\n\n11               THE COURT:     So what's the urgency associated with that\n\n12   issue?\n\n13               MS. WILLIAMSON:      The urgency, Your Honor, is that the\n\n14   states are having to re-shuttle resources right now.             So the\n\n15   states have devoted resources and, for example, Secretary Wu's\n\n16   declaration outlines this.        The states have had to do things\n\n17   like put up additional websites, host new events.             The states\n\n18   have to act now because people are suddenly unemployed now.\n\n19   Because the requirement for their rapid response services\n\n20   especially that kicks in not down the line --\n\n21               THE COURT:     So your point is that if the law provides\n\n22   for a rapid response, and there isn't an immediate remedy\n\n23   ordered by the court, the capacity of the state to respond\n\n24   rapidly is lost.\n\n25               MS. WILLIAMSON:      Precisely, Your Honor.\n\n\n              Kassandra L.

WILLIAMSON:    Yes.\n\n 3               THE COURT:   Because a response that comes next June,\n\n 4   next October, whenever the litigation ended and you prevailed,\n\n 5   on the assumption that you do prevail, an assumption I make only\n\n 6   for purposes of this discussion, there wouldn't be any way to go\n\n 7   back to March and mitigate the harms that were inflicted then by\n\n 8   the illegal action that the Government took.\n\n 9               MS. WILLIAMSON:    Exactly, Your Honor.      Yes.\n\n10               THE COURT:   You may continue.\n\n11               MS. WILLIAMSON:    Yes, Your Honor.     So again, the harms\n\n12   here are irreparable.\n\n13       I want to touch briefly on two jurisdictional arguments\n\n14   that my friend on the other side has raised.          First, the issue\n\n15   of standing.     This court has standing.     The plaintiffs' states\n\n16   have suffered a host of injuries, injuries that are --\n\n17               THE COURT:   It's not really about whether this Court\n\n18   has standing, it's about whether you have standing.\n\n19               MS. WILLIAMSON:    Sorry, excuse me.      Yes.   The States\n\n20   have standing.     The States have standing, excuse me.         The Court\n\n21   has jurisdiction, the States have standing.         So the states have\n\n22   standing.    The states have suffered a host of injuries.          Those\n\n23   injuries include the many injuries that we've talked about, the\n\n24   ability to -- the injury to the ability to perform rapid\n\n25   response, the ability of the injury to state finances, the host\n\n\n            Kassandra L. McPherson, RPR - Federal Official Court Reporter\n\n                                      JA430\n\f                               03/12/2025 TRO Hearing                       17\n\n\n 1   of administrative expenses that the states are suffering as a\n\n 2   result of the need to rapidly regroup and devote its own\n\n 3   resources, new resources to trying to provide services to --\n\n 4   that are required -- that they're required to provide under law.\n\n 5       Although my friend on the other side cites chiefly United\n\n 6   States verse Texas, in suggesting that the states don't have\n\n 7   standing, that case in sort of proper context is not a case that\n\n 8   is on point here.\n\n 9       And I'd point out at least two things about the case.\n\n10   Number one, that case was a follow-on decision following and\n\n11   applying a prior decision of the Supreme Court in a case called\n\n12   Linda RS and that case held that in the criminal context, in a\n\n13   criminal enforcement context, a state -- a third party can't\n\n14   intervene saying that sort of follow-on affects of enforcement\n\n15   activity or lack of enforcement activity that they suffered,\n\n16   that won't be a cognizable harm.\n\n17       So in Linda RX -- or RS, the plaintiff there sought to rely\n\n18   on the child support payments and say there needs to be\n\n19   essentially more enforcement of child support payments, and the\n\n20   Court said that's not a space that we are going to allow a third\n\n21   party to intervene in.\n\n22       In the Texas case, the Supreme Court simply said we've\n\n23   already decided that in an enforcement type context, and this\n\n24   enforcement context in the Texas case was the immigration space.\n\n25   We're not going to say that the injuries -- those are not\n\n\n            Kassandra L. McPherson, RPR - Federal Official Court Reporter\n\n                                      JA431\n\f                               03/12/2025 TRO Hearing                          18\n\n\n 1   judicially cognizable injuries to these third parties.\n\n 2       My friends on the other side primarily rely on a footnote,\n\n 3   footnote three of that opinion.       But that footnote doesn't stand\n\n 4   for the proposition that direct injuries to the state aren't --\n\n 5   aren't injuries under understanding principles.           They are, in\n\n 6   fact, injuries understanding principles.           And we know that, in\n\n 7   part, because the very term that the Supreme Court decided the\n\n 8   Texas decision, it decided other cases upholding state standing.\n\n 9       So, for example, the Biden versus Nebraska decision.\n\n10   There, the Supreme Court said that the state of Missouri had\n\n11   standing because the instrumentality of the state could show\n\n12   that it had been harmed in the form of moneys that it would no\n\n13   longer receive under a contract if the state forgave certain\n\n14   student loans, because the state, which would service the\n\n15   contract, couldn't service the contract if loans were forgiven.\n\n16   And those injuries were recognized by the court as sufficient to\n\n17   demonstrate the state standing.       In fact, the government in that\n\n18   case didn't even contest that that was -- that financial injury\n\n19   was, in fact, a sufficient injury for standing.\n\n20       There are a host of other decisions.           Your Honor, I would\n\n21   also note for example, I think a situation that's quite\n\n22   analogous to this, in a sort of DOPA litigation, the Supreme\n\n23   Court upheld in a case that's also called United States verse\n\n24   Texas, the Supreme Court upheld a decision of Fifth Circuit that\n\n25   had held that the State of Texas had standing where the injuries\n\n\n            Kassandra L.

And the Supreme Court affirmed that decision without an\n\n 6   opinion.\n\n 7       So yes, the states have standing.          The decisions on which\n\n 8   of which my friends, on the other side, rely don't undermine\n\n 9   that point.\n\n10       On the issue of traceability, I also point out my friends\n\n11   on the other side primarily rely on the Murthy decision of the\n\n12   Supreme Court.    But Murthy is plainly distinguishable.           That\n\n13   case, yes, it involved many defendants, but the issue -- the\n\n14   court didn't take issue with, just the number of defendants in\n\n15   the case, what the court took issue with was that there was sort\n\n16   of a knot, as the court framed it; a tangle of where it was\n\n17   unclear what defendant did what to who, at what time.            It was --\n\n18   there was no ability for the court -- in fact, the court\n\n19   described itself as untangling in the opinion, to figure out,\n\n20   who had -- what the allegations were against each defendant.\n\n21       There's no such thing in this case.             In this case, it's\n\n22   quite clear what the allegations are and what each of the\n\n23   defendant agencies failed to do.        So Murthy is also not on point\n\n24   for this situation.     And the state's harms would be rejust by an\n\n25   order of the court providing an injunction, a preliminary\n\n\n             Kassandra L.

Would it be alright\n\n17   if I use the podium to my left here?\n\n18              THE COURT:     You are welcome to.\n\n19       In the 19 states and the District of Columbia, how many\n\n20   probationary employees are within the scope framed by these\n\n21   plaintiffs?    How many probationary employees has your client\n\n22   terminated?    Your clients terminated?\n\n23              MR. HAMILTON:     I can't make a representation on that\n\n24   right now.    As Your Honor knows, I have 41 clients in this\n\n25   litigation, we're at a very early phase in this case.            And right\n\n\n             Kassandra L.

HAMILTON:     We haven't taken a position at this\n\n24   stage of the litigation.\n\n25               THE COURT:     This is your time to do so.\n\n\n              Kassandra L.

HAMILTON:      I don't know, Your Honor.\n\n 8             THE COURT:     You don't know if anybody in the\n\n 9   Government knows.    Okay.    Go ahead.\n\n10             MR. HAMILTON:      Your Honor, I'll start with standing.\n\n11   Plaintiffs have not shown that they have standing to litigate\n\n12   this case.   The plaintiffs rely nearly exclusively on downstream\n\n13   incidental effects of probationary employee terminations.\n\n14       The U.S. Supreme Court considered injuries like --\n\n15             THE COURT:     So let's just jump ahead for a moment.        If\n\n16   the court were to conclude that, actually, you engaged in a RIF\n\n17   or multiple RIFs, would you concede that then, the states do\n\n18   have standing?\n\n19             MR. HAMILTON:      No, Your Honor, I don't think they\n\n20   would have standing.\n\n21             THE COURT:     Well, doesn't the statute specifically\n\n22   talk about states when it is crafting the procedures that must\n\n23   be followed with respect to RIFs?\n\n24             MR. HAMILTON:      It says that when there's a RIF, the\n\n25   states get a notice of that.      But just because a statute says\n\n\n            Kassandra L. McPherson, RPR - Federal Official Court Reporter\n\n                                      JA436\n\f                               03/12/2025 TRO Hearing                       23\n\n\n 1   that a state --\n\n 2             THE COURT:     Well, why would Congress require that the\n\n 3   states be given a notice?\n\n 4             MR. HAMILTON:     I suspect it's because they wanted the\n\n 5   states to have the notice to be able to do the rapid response\n\n 6   activities that the plaintiffs were talking about.\n\n 7             THE COURT:     To mitigate the consequences for the state\n\n 8   of the RIF.    True?\n\n 9             MR. HAMILTON:     To allow the states to participate in\n\n10   helping employees, I think, mitigate the consequences of their\n\n11   termination.\n\n12       But my bottom-line point is, that this is an informational\n\n13   injury in the end and that isn't sufficient to confer standing.\n\n14   The Trans Union case holds that an injury in law is not\n\n15   necessarily an injury in fact.       And in assessing the\n\n16   concreteness of an injury in fact, the harm has to have some\n\n17   kind of a close relationship to a harm traditionally recognized\n\n18   at common law.\n\n19       Failing to get a notice does not mean that, in the end,\n\n20   what plaintiffs are relying on are these downstream incidental\n\n21   effects of the termination of probationaries.\n\n22             THE COURT:     Well, wouldn't there be some significance\n\n23   to the particular notice that was failed to be given?           In other\n\n24   words, what's the purpose of a notice?        What's the purpose of\n\n25   the information?\n\n\n            Kassandra L. McPherson, RPR - Federal Official Court Reporter\n\n                                      JA437\n\f                               03/12/2025 TRO Hearing                         24\n\n\n 1             MR. HAMILTON:     I'm not disputing that the purpose is\n\n 2   to allow states to participate in assisting individuals in their\n\n 3   states with relocating employees, helping them find some sort of\n\n 4   a new role.   But in the end, that is a downstream effect of what\n\n 5   the plaintiffs are trying to challenge, which is this decision\n\n 6   by the Federal Government in connection with its employees to\n\n 7   separate probationary employees.\n\n 8             THE COURT:     I don't read the complaint that way.          The\n\n 9   complaint is trying to get relief for the impact on the states.\n\n10   The employees are not parties to this litigation.            They've gone\n\n11   to other courts and been told to go to the Merit System\n\n12   Protection Board.    Fair enough.     That issue is not before me.\n\n13   But the states, themselves, have their own issues, their own\n\n14   impacts, their own consequences from a RIF procedure not being\n\n15   properly executed.\n\n16       That's why I think it's a critical question at this very\n\n17   early stage as to whether or not this was a RIF.          Because if it\n\n18   was, the rest of it seems pretty clear, including standing.\n\n19             MR. HAMILTON:     Well, the -- I mean, they're talking\n\n20   about injuries like loss of tax revenue, having to enroll people\n\n21   on unemployment insurance.      They note, though, that they aren't\n\n22   actually required to pay out the unemployment insurance and that\n\n23   the Federal Government reimburses that.         So it's an\n\n24   administrative burden, one that wouldn't even be redressable by\n\n25   a temporary restraining order because we would be talking about\n\n\n            Kassandra L. McPherson, RPR - Federal Official Court Reporter\n\n                                      JA438\n\f                               03/12/2025 TRO Hearing                           25\n\n\n 1   reinstating employees, and the administrative burden of\n\n 2   enrolling someone in unemployment insurance through the state\n\n 3   system would have already happened.\n\n 4             THE COURT:     Yes, I'm less interested in that also.\n\n 5   I'm much more interested in the intent of Congress to make sure\n\n 6   that states are prepared and ready to take on the social\n\n 7   services consequences and burdens that will be inflicted upon\n\n 8   them when thousands of people lose their jobs.          And this is also\n\n 9   why this is different from United States versus Texas.            It's a\n\n10   very explicit plan, expressed in the statute, that the states be\n\n11   notified and that the states in fact do form their rapid\n\n12   response elements and get ready and mitigate the inevitable\n\n13   harms that come from a lot of people suddenly losing their jobs.\n\n14             MR. HAMILTON:     But viewing the issue through a\n\n15   standing lens, I take my friend on the other side to be saying,\n\n16   if this had happened through RIF procedures, we would be\n\n17   engaging in a rapid response right now.         But that hasn't\n\n18   happened and so there is no injury.        I don't take them to be\n\n19   saying we're very concerned that the Federal Government is going\n\n20   to bring some lawsuit against us saying that we haven't complied\n\n21   with our rapid response obligations.        There's no injury in fact.\n\n22   And it also isn't redressable by the temporary restraining order\n\n23   that they are seeking.\n\n24             THE COURT:     Well, the states not injured when some\n\n25   third party does something to them that leaves them or impairs\n\n\n            Kassandra L. McPherson, RPR - Federal Official Court Reporter\n\n                                      JA439\n\f                                  03/12/2025 TRO Hearing                           26\n\n\n 1   their capacity to perform their responsibilities; their legal\n\n 2   responsibilities to their citizens?\n\n 3                MR. HAMILTON:     Well, that's not an injury in fact\n\n 4   though.     It's, you know, they're not spending money, they\n\n 5   weren't doing anything.        It's the absence of an injury.         And I\n\n 6   also don't know what --\n\n 7                THE COURT:     But how haven't they in their affidavit\n\n 8   said that they are -- that they're diverting resources, they're\n\n 9   scrambling, that they're setting up websites that they otherwise\n\n10   wouldn't necessarily have to.         They're searching for -- they're\n\n11   deploying resources to search for information that should have\n\n12   been conveyed to them clearly, crisply, directly; here's how\n\n13   many people we're going to fire, here's when we're going to fire\n\n14   them, here are the counties that they live in, et cetera.\n\n15       Instead, they're left to deploy their workers, interns,\n\n16   whoever they can get hold of; go scour the newspapers, watch the\n\n17   television shows, see what they're announcing they're going to\n\n18   do next and try to read the tea leaves about who might actually\n\n19   get fired and who might not, as opposed to the orderly\n\n20   notifications that the statute contemplates.\n\n21                MR. HAMILTON:     So that's conduct that they're all\n\n22   choosing to undertake right now.          They're not required to do\n\n23   that because there never was a RIF in the first place.\n\n24       On standing, I also want to address my friend's comments on\n\n25   the --\n\n\n               Kassandra L.

HAMILTON:     I don't think so.      I think we're still\n\n 5   talking about downstream effects of the termination of a\n\n 6   probationary employee, which is what the plaintiffs are trying\n\n 7   to do here.    They aren't even asking the Court to order\n\n 8   defendants to provide notice of a RIF, they're seeking a\n\n 9   temporary restraining order that they say would have the effect\n\n10   of restoring tens of thousands of employees to the Federal\n\n11   Government and then they want an additional temporary\n\n12   restraining order that would prevent the Federal Government from\n\n13   terminating probationary employees in certain situations.\n\n14              THE COURT:     Well, I read it they want the RIF\n\n15   rescinded.    They want a restoration under a TRO to the status\n\n16   quo.   You executed a RIF; you didn't do it correctly.           Back up,\n\n17   start over if you want; you don't have to do anything.             But you\n\n18   can't do this RIF because you didn't execute this RIF correctly.\n\n19              MR. HAMILTON:     And that doesn't even seem to address\n\n20   their injury because they're still going to end up spending the\n\n21   same money, engaging in the same conduct in the end.            And I'd\n\n22   add also --\n\n23              THE COURT:     Well, that assumes that you're going to\n\n24   execute the same policy over again.         If you do, at least\n\n25   presumably the next time you would do it in a lawful manner,\n\n\n             Kassandra L.

And then\n\n 3   upon the passage of 60 days, when the terminations actually\n\n 4   start to occur, they're ready to shoulder the burden that falls\n\n 5   upon them when thousands of people are laid off.\n\n 6             MR. HAMILTON:     But in the end, those are downstream\n\n 7   effects of the termination of an employee.         And we read United\n\n 8   States against Texas to throw a huge doubt on the viability of\n\n 9   that downstream action by the state and the connection of the\n\n10   termination of an -- excuse me -- downstream action and the\n\n11   context of the determination of a probationer.\n\n12       On the Murthy case --\n\n13             THE COURT:     Let's go on to some other element of this.\n\n14   We're not going to get anywhere on this one.\n\n15             MR.

HAMILTON:     I wanted to respond to my friend's\n\n18   comments on the Murthy case because this really is quite similar\n\n19   to the Murthy case.    The Supreme Court called that a sprawling\n\n20   suit, dozens of Federal Government defendants were sued.               This\n\n21   is similar; 41 federal agencies and agency head defendants.\n\n22       And Your Honor, I'd note that this suit is so\n\n23   extraordinarily large that plaintiffs already struggling to\n\n24   manage its huge breadth.     They submitted 19 declarations of\n\n25   individuals, who they say were terminated as probationary\n\n\n            Kassandra L.

Two declarations are from employees and they haven't\n\n 2   even sued the agencies that those employees work at; FEMA and\n\n 3   NOAA.   That's Exhibits W and AA.\n\n 4       They submitted a declaration of someone who admitted he\n\n 5   doesn't even live in any of the plaintiff states.            That's\n\n 6   Exhibit W, who lives in Virginia.\n\n 7       They also sued five agencies without identifying anyone\n\n 8   terminated by them; DOD, Commerce, DHS, NARA and SVA.            They even\n\n 9   admit in their complaint that the Department of Defense has not\n\n10   terminated a probationary employee, leaving us to wonder what\n\n11   the agency action could conceivably be for the Department of\n\n12   Defense and these other defendants.\n\n13       Plaintiffs are framing the agency actions at issue as OPM\n\n14   memos, which have since been revised.         They were revised after\n\n15   the District Court in California entered a very narrow TRO just\n\n16   directed at OPM.     And then they conceptualized these, what they\n\n17   say are tens of thousands of probationary employee terminations\n\n18   as each independent agency actions and ultra vires acts of the\n\n19   government.\n\n20       Looking ahead in this case, it seems likely plaintiffs will\n\n21   be filing amended complaints any time a new agency announces the\n\n22   termination of probationary employees.         There are hundreds of\n\n23   federal agencies.     So far, plaintiffs have made 21 defendants\n\n24   here.   This is not the kind of lawsuit that -- excuse me -- this\n\n25   is not the sort of dispute that is designed for adjudication in\n\n\n             Kassandra L.

Instead, we note the court lacks jurisdiction\n\n 2   because a Civil Service Reform Act created a scheme to resolve\n\n 3   disputes over a federal employee's termination by the Federal\n\n 4   Government.      Those are litigated in the Merit Service Protection\n\n 5   Board.\n\n 6                THE COURT:     So the states would have standing before\n\n 7   the Merit System Protection Board to go in and litigate their\n\n 8   interests?\n\n 9                MR. HAMILTON:     States do not have --\n\n10                THE COURT:     Of course they don't.      So where do the\n\n11   states go?\n\n12                MR. HAMILTON:     Well, their injuries are not of the\n\n13   sort that --\n\n14                THE COURT:     If they did have injuries, where would\n\n15   they go?\n\n16                MR. HAMILTON:     If they did have injuries?\n\n17                THE COURT:     Yeah.   If they had cognizable injuries, in\n\n18   what form do they seek their redress?           I can answer that for\n\n19   you.     That's in the United States District Court.\n\n20                MR.

I'm not going to\n\n\n               Kassandra L.

But\n\n 2   are you suggesting that because of Thunder Basin they don't have\n\n 3   the right to pursue a particular remedy even though they are not\n\n 4   the employees?    They're not the parties that the Thunder Basin\n\n 5   criteria would seem to apply to.\n\n 6             MR. HAMILTON:     I'll say this.     They don't have the\n\n 7   right to the remedy they're seeking today, which is a temporary\n\n 8   restraining order reinstating what they say are tens of\n\n 9   thousands of probationary employees.\n\n10       Again, they aren't asking today for --\n\n11             THE COURT:     How about a lesser order that simply\n\n12   orders the recission of the RIF?\n\n13             MR. HAMILTON:     That -- at least if construed to result\n\n14   in restoring individuals to federal employment, I don't see how\n\n15   that is distinguishable.\n\n16             THE COURT:     So even though they're entitled to a\n\n17   rescission of the RIF, because it was done illegally, if that\n\n18   has the consequence of reinstating employees, something that\n\n19   employees themselves can only seek before the MSPB, then the\n\n20   Court can't order that.\n\n21             MR. HAMILTON:     Because it is --\n\n22             THE COURT:     But the MSPB owns that remedy and then no\n\n23   court can order it, even if it is remedying some completely\n\n24   different harm.\n\n25             MR.

HAMILTON:     I mean, there's federal circuit\n\n 4   precedent recognizing and -- you know, the MSPB's work in this\n\n 5   space.    And the Thunder Basin Doctrine exists to determine what\n\n 6   sort of claims are channeled exclusively to the MSPB and other\n\n 7   civil service bodies.\n\n 8               THE COURT:     But how do you apply Thunder Basin to say\n\n 9   the state's claims trying to remedy their unique harms, not as\n\n10   federal employees, as states bound by federal law and state law,\n\n11   to provide certain services on a rapid or emergency basis, are\n\n12   barred from seeking, as you say four times in your brief, the\n\n13   only remedy that could possibly resolve this:             Reinstatement.\n\n14       How does that hold?\n\n15               MR. HAMILTON:     Well, so I think it's notable that they\n\n16   aren't even seeking to get notice from the Federal Government.\n\n17   They're, at least at this stage of the case, they're just\n\n18   focusing on reinstating these employees.             They haven't asked the\n\n19   court to enter any sort of order on the actual statute that\n\n20   touches them, which is that requirement when there's a RIF to\n\n21   give notice to the states.\n\n22       One more point on Thunder Basin, Your Honor.              I think the\n\n23   thrust of the plaintiff's argument here is they don't seem to\n\n24   disagree that individual employees cannot bring an argument in\n\n25   an Article III Court to get their probationary termination\n\n\n              Kassandra L.

Instead, it seems to be that under their view,\n\n 2   Congress created this scheme, recognizing the questions about\n\n 3   federal employment and whether an employee should be restored to\n\n 4   federal service should go to this Merit Service Protection\n\n 5   Board, but if some party, like a state, a third party to that\n\n 6   employment relationship can identify some incidental way that a\n\n 7   federal employment termination affects them, then they can bring\n\n 8   a lawsuit in an Article III Court, and seek here, according to\n\n 9   plaintiffs, the restoration of tens of thousands of employees\n\n10   into Federal Government service, compelling them, compelling the\n\n11   executive branch to employ them, to pay their salaries.            Your\n\n12   Honor, that makes no sense of the statute that Congress has\n\n13   enacted, and I'd note that this is something that now two courts\n\n14   --\n\n15             THE COURT:     Why does that make no sense?\n\n16             MR. HAMILTON:     Well, it makes no sense because --\n\n17             THE COURT:     Because your argument is couched whether\n\n18   explicitly or implicitly in a notion that states in this case\n\n19   are functionally kind of like the unions, I guess, before Judge\n\n20   Shutkin, that they are surrogates for the employees.\n\n21        The Government isn't responding to the core contention that\n\n22   is operating in this space in this case.           That is the states\n\n23   have their own interests, their own harms that when a large\n\n24   employer, like the Federal Government, suddenly lays off\n\n25   thousands of people, that there's a burden that falls on other\n\n\n            Kassandra L.

In this case State Government.        That's\n\n 2   its own issue.\n\n 3                MR. HAMILTON:     Sure.    But the missing link is why\n\n 4   would restoring tens of thousands of workers into the Federal\n\n 5   Government be the remedy for that?\n\n 6                THE COURT:     Because those people, once back in\n\n 7   employment, don't need the rapid emergency services this weekend\n\n 8   that the state is otherwise bound to provide to them.              And had\n\n 9   they been given 60 days, would have been better prepared to\n\n10   provide to them.\n\n11                MR. HAMILTON:     But in the end, it's a notice that the\n\n12   state -- that the statute requires the Federal Government to\n\n13   give the states and that's only when there's a RIF and there\n\n14   hasn't been a RIF here.\n\n15       I can move to our merits arguments.\n\n16                THE COURT:     Why don't you.     I think we've exhausted\n\n17   this part of it.       So tell me why it's not a RIF and tell my what\n\n18   it was.\n\n19                MR. HAMILTON:     So, Your Honor, these were terminations\n\n20   of probationary employees.         And the OPM regulations, as well as\n\n21   statutes, give Federal Government employers substantial\n\n22   discretion in separating probationary employees.\n\n23                THE COURT:     See if you agree with this proposition.\n\n24   Studying the law, as I have over the last few days, it seems to\n\n25   me that there's basically three ways that you can terminate a\n\n\n               Kassandra L.

It was erroneous; it was made on\n\n 9   a faulty premise, you're fired.\n\n10       Second avenue would be if the employee is not performing.\n\n11   They're in their probationary period and they're not fully\n\n12   successful at performing the job that they were hired to do.\n\n13   And on that basis, while the employee is still on probation,\n\n14   they can be pretty summarily terminated.\n\n15       And the third avenue would be, we don't have any complaint\n\n16   with you in particular, and you didn't -- you weren't deceptive\n\n17   and you didn't mislead us about your qualifications and so\n\n18   forth, but the government has decided to move into a different\n\n19   direction, broadly speaking, and we are going to have a major\n\n20   course correction.    We're going to substantially diminish the\n\n21   size of the department of government.        We're going to pursue\n\n22   different policies, perhaps because there was an election and\n\n23   new leadership has come into the government and we have decided,\n\n24   pursuant to the authority that's implicit in that process, to\n\n25   take the government in a different direction.

Am I\n\n 6   missing the fourth or fifth category?\n\n 7                MR. HAMILTON:     I don't have anything to supplement\n\n 8   that with right now.        There may be additional provisions of the\n\n 9   Title 5 that allow for termination of employees.\n\n10                THE COURT:     So the government contends in this case\n\n11   that, well, this was not a reduction in force.             You don't know\n\n12   how many employees were terminated.           There's evidence in this\n\n13   record suggesting that it was in the thousands, perhaps in the\n\n14   tens of thousands of probationary employees who were dismissed.\n\n15   So it's not the third option in your view; it wasn't a RIF.\n\n16   What was it?\n\n17                MR. HAMILTON:     It was the termination of probationary\n\n18   employees.      And plaintiffs have put forward 19 documents under\n\n19   seal right now that contain the different agencies terminations\n\n20   to separate probationary employees.           Those documents vary in\n\n21   different ways.       They don't all follow a single template.            And\n\n22   all of them are consistent with the OPM regulations for the\n\n23   separation of an individual who is still in the probationary\n\n24   period.\n\n25       The probationary employee bears the burden of establishing\n\n\n               Kassandra L.

And\n\n 3   the standard is pretty simple in the OPM regulation.           It says\n\n 4   that the agency has a duty to determine the fitness of the\n\n 5   employee.    And I think there are a number of different ways to\n\n 6   measure that.\n\n 7               THE COURT:    So let's take an employee that got their\n\n 8   performance appraisal a couple weeks ago and it was exemplary.\n\n 9   And yet, nonetheless, they receive a notice terminating them\n\n10   during the probationary period.        I take it that that wasn't\n\n11   because something was discovered that was deceptive about their\n\n12   application, so we're really just in that second pathway, which\n\n13   is their performance is not satisfactory; they're not fully\n\n14   successful in the job.\n\n15               MR. HAMILTON:     Well, a few points, Your Honor.          One --\n\n16   one point would be that one evaluator's evaluation of an\n\n17   individual employee might not be the same evaluation that\n\n18   someone else in the agency would give to that same employee.\n\n19               THE COURT:    But at least under your hypothetical, they\n\n20   were re-evaluated.       So all of these people, whether it's 50\n\n21   people, you've conceded it's probably not less than 50, the\n\n22   suggestion of the plaintiff is it's in tens of thousands; they\n\n23   were re-evaluated, each of them.         They were re-evaluated and\n\n24   their performance was found to be substandard, inefficient, not\n\n25   fully successful and that's why they were terminated.\n\n\n            Kassandra L.

HAMILTON:     Well, we only have documents from 19\n\n 2   employees in the record.      And what those documents say is that\n\n 3   the agency made a determination under the Probationary Employee\n\n 4   Regulations that OPM has put out, that they were not fit for\n\n 5   employment.   And --\n\n 6              THE COURT:    Can the Court make a determination as a\n\n 7   finding of fact in support of a request for a TRO that the\n\n 8   notion that tens of thousands of probationary employees were\n\n 9   evaluated or re-evaluated, their performance was found to be\n\n10   substandard and were terminated on that basis?            Can the Court,\n\n11   just from the bald facts, conclude that that's just implausible?\n\n12              MR. HAMILTON:     No, Your Honor.        To start, we don't\n\n13   have facts about the number of employees at issue, which were\n\n14   involved with the agencies that our defendants.            Plaintiffs are\n\n15   generally relying on newspaper articles and things like that for\n\n16   their assertions about the quantity of the employees at issue.\n\n17       And instead, the documents that are in the record for\n\n18   actual Federal Government employees who were terminated, shows\n\n19   that there was ant RIF and that these agencies made judgments\n\n20   that the probationers were not fit for Federal Government\n\n21   service.\n\n22       And the notice requirement that the OPM regulations state\n\n23   is -- is it doesn't require much.        I mean, it says that the\n\n24   employees have to be notified that they were terminated.

It has to be.\n\n 4             THE COURT:     So what do I make of statements like this?\n\n 5   The purpose of this notice is to notify you of the decision to\n\n 6   terminate your employment with the U.S. Department of Housing\n\n 7   and Urban Development, HUD, during your trial period in order to\n\n 8   promote the efficiency of the federal service in accordance with\n\n 9   the priorities of the administration.\n\n10       It doesn't sound like that has anything to do with this\n\n11   employee's performance.\n\n12             MR. HAMILTON:     Well, there's a note about efficiency\n\n13   there and that -- not sure about this specific employee, but\n\n14   that could reference the employee's efficiency.          But I would\n\n15   also note that the government's vision for a particular role is\n\n16   necessarily a part of any sort of fitness determination that an\n\n17   employee in the agency is going to make about a probationer.\n\n18   It's not possible to determine the fitness of an employee\n\n19   without asking fit for what, which would be the role, and\n\n20   whatever the federal government's expectations are for the role\n\n21   in question.\n\n22             THE COURT:     Well, wouldn't the most logical approach\n\n23   to all of this be that if there is a broad determination like\n\n24   that, which is that a whole category of employees are no longer\n\n25   valuable to the government because of new objectives, new\n\n\n            Kassandra L. McPherson, RPR - Federal Official Court Reporter\n\n                                      JA453\n\f                                 03/12/2025 TRO Hearing                       40\n\n\n 1   directions, a new course, et cetera, then the most logical\n\n 2   interpretation of that situation is that we are terminating\n\n 3   employees as a group in order to achieve a broader objective?\n\n 4   Isn't that what the RIF process is obviously designed to\n\n 5   address?    And that really what we're trying to do is cram a\n\n 6   square peg into a round hole in trying to convince this court\n\n 7   that oh, no, all of these people were reviewed for their\n\n 8   specific capacities and their personal performance in their\n\n 9   jobs, and on the basis of their less than satisfactory or fully\n\n10   successful performance, they were terminated.\n\n11               MR. HAMILTON:     Well, Your Honor, two important\n\n12   distinctions about the termination of probationary employees\n\n13   from RIF.    One, the RIF is not going to involve a judgment about\n\n14   an individual's performance on the job.\n\n15               THE COURT:     Exactly.    And isn't that exactly what the\n\n16   agencies have done in this case?         They've decided that they're\n\n17   going to go in a different direction.          There was an election.\n\n18   There's a new administration.         There's a whole new perspective\n\n19   at the top of the Executive Branch of Government in terms of how\n\n20   government should operate, how many people should work for the\n\n21   government, the work that the government should do across the\n\n22   board.\n\n23       And accordingly, in alignment with that realignment, they\n\n24   decided to shift thousands of persons out of federal employment.\n\n25   Which may well be their prerogative, that's not an issue that's\n\n\n              Kassandra L. McPherson, RPR - Federal Official Court Reporter\n\n                                        JA454\n\f                                  03/12/2025 TRO Hearing                        41\n\n\n 1   before the court.       This case isn't about whether or not the\n\n 2   government can terminate people, it's about if they decide to\n\n 3   terminate people how they must do it.\n\n 4       Move fast and break things.           Move fast, fine.      Break\n\n 5   things?     If that involves breaking the law, then that becomes\n\n 6   problematic.      Isn't that really at the heart of what's going on\n\n 7   here?\n\n 8                MR. HAMILTON:     I don't think so, Your Honor.         The\n\n 9   guidance document that OPM put out noted the Agency's authority.\n\n10   Well, really their obligation to be constantly assessing\n\n11   individuals who were in their probationary period for their\n\n12   fitness for Federal Government service.            And that is what the\n\n13   documents that plaintiffs have submitted show that the agencies\n\n14   did here.\n\n15       The President signed an executive order directing some\n\n16   agencies to start making plans for a reduction in force, but\n\n17   that -- you know, the timeline for that doesn't match up with\n\n18   what happened here, where OPM put out a guidance document on the\n\n19   first day of the new administration.           And the reductions in\n\n20   force were slated to happen later in time.\n\n21       Another important distinction between a reduction in force\n\n22   and the termination of a probationary employee is that with a\n\n23   reduction in force a role is eliminated, but with the\n\n24   termination of a probationer, it remains a possibility that that\n\n25   role can be filled.       And there is a hiring freeze right now, but\n\n\n               Kassandra L. McPherson, RPR - Federal Official Court Reporter\n\n                                         JA455\n\f                               03/12/2025 TRO Hearing                              42\n\n\n 1   there are exceptions to the hiring freeze.         And so agencies that\n\n 2   are not covered by the hiring freeze may be in a position to\n\n 3   fill roles from individuals who were separated as probationers.\n\n 4   And right now that hiring freeze is slated to end next month.\n\n 5   So there may be well be additional agencies that are able to\n\n 6   fill roles that were vacated by terminated probationers.               That\n\n 7   isn't something that would happen if there were a RIF.\n\n 8       Another RIF authority I want to cite is 5 CFR 351.204,\n\n 9   which says that RIF procedures take effect when the agency\n\n10   determines that a reduction in force is necessary.           That hasn't\n\n11   happened here.   The documents that the plaintiffs have submitted\n\n12   instead are termination documents of probationary employees\n\n13   during their probationary terms, consistent with the significant\n\n14   discretion that Congress has allowed Federal Government\n\n15   departments and agencies to exercise during this probationary\n\n16   term of Federal Government employees.\n\n17       Finally, Your Honor, I just note that plaintiffs have not\n\n18   made the required showing on the remaining elements of a\n\n19   temporary restraining order, which are irreparable harm,\n\n20   especially true for the you nope the financial injuries that\n\n21   they are alleging.    Really our arguments here are really similar\n\n22   to our standing arguments.\n\n23       And a very important consideration in weighing the balance\n\n24   of the equities and the public interest is the enormous\n\n25   destruction that would happen for the Federal Government if a\n\n\n            Kassandra L.

What's the disruption?       Is the\n\n 5   disruption the continuation of the people in their jobs; jobs\n\n 6   they were in as recently as a few weeks ago?           Or is the\n\n 7   disruption their sudden terminations from those jobs?              I mean,\n\n 8   the job of the court in the context of the TRO is if found -- if\n\n 9   the other bases are satisfied, is to restore the status quo.\n\n10   What's the -- isn't the status quo the way things were before\n\n11   the action that arguably was unlawful was taken?           You following\n\n12   me?\n\n13              MR. HAMILTON:     I think so, Your Honor.       But also it is\n\n14   a temporary restraining order, not a preliminary injunction.\n\n15   And so to the extent plaintiffs are trying to restore people\n\n16   into Federal Government service, that isn't a restraint on any\n\n17   of the defendants, instead that looks much more like a mandatory\n\n18   injunction and not -- not a restraint.\n\n19         On the balance of the equities though, and the public\n\n20   interest, the effect on the government is relevant.            The effect\n\n21   on the government is so much more substantial than the effect on\n\n22   the plaintiffs.     The defendants would presumably be required to\n\n23   pay salaries out to these employees, which would far exceed\n\n24   whatever injuries the plaintiffs can identify.           And the Federal\n\n25   Government, it seems would also be required to employ people who\n\n\n             Kassandra L. McPherson, RPR - Federal Official Court Reporter\n\n                                       JA457\n\f                               03/12/2025 TRO Hearing                        44\n\n\n 1   it has determine ready not fit for Federal Government service.\n\n 2             THE COURT:     But if the Court were to find as a matter\n\n 3   of fact that what actually happened here was nothing about their\n\n 4   performance and their fitness but was a RIF, it's just that you\n\n 5   didn't execute the RIF properly, according to law, isn't the\n\n 6   status quo to have the federal employees remain in employment\n\n 7   until you redo the RIF, which seems to be your client's\n\n 8   inclination, and, you know, execute properly; give all the\n\n 9   notices, allow the states to get ready to face the burden of\n\n10   discharged employees, et cetera.\n\n11             MR. HAMILTON:     I'm not so sure that the status quo is\n\n12   measured all the way back to January 20th, or it wouldn't be at\n\n13   the time that the Court is entering its order.\n\n14             THE COURT:     But if the Court finds that the Government\n\n15   attempted a RIF, but was unsuccessful in doing so; you never\n\n16   actually properly executed the RIF.        People effectively haven't\n\n17   been lawfully terminated, at least on a temporary basis, that's\n\n18   the conclusion.\n\n19       Why isn't the imperative to, you know, restore the order\n\n20   and the state of things that existed before the Government's\n\n21   attempted mass discharge that was apparently unlawful?            Why\n\n22   would we allow the new circumstance, not the status quo, to\n\n23   persist until ultimate resolution of the case?\n\n24             MR. HAMILTON:     Because this is just for the purpose of\n\n25   at most preserving the status quo, as it stands today.            This is\n\n\n            Kassandra L. McPherson, RPR - Federal Official Court Reporter\n\n                                      JA458\n\f                                  03/12/2025 TRO Hearing                       45\n\n\n 1   a 14-day remedy on short briefing, short time.             And it wouldn't\n\n 2   be consistent with the restraint order in the temporary\n\n 3   restraining order for there to be this extraordinary remedy of\n\n 4   compelling the defendants to take back into federal service a\n\n 5   substantial number of individuals who it has determined are not\n\n 6   fit for government service.\n\n 7       You know, looking forward --\n\n 8                THE COURT:     But if this was an was an attempt at a\n\n 9   RIF, but the RIF was not successfully accomplished, were the\n\n10   people actually ever discharged from federal service?\n\n11                MR. HAMILTON:     They were.     I mean plaintiffs have\n\n12   submitted evidence of 19 individuals who received statements\n\n13   that they were being terminated.          Some of them, I would note,\n\n14   allowed a period of time during which those individuals would\n\n15   continue to draw down salaries after receiving their termination\n\n16   notice.     One allowed three weeks or something like that.\n\n17       So, again, I think if --\n\n18                THE COURT:     You're saying treat those discharge\n\n19   letters as operable, even if they were unlawful.\n\n20                MR. HAMILTON:     Well, my arguments -- I mean, if we're\n\n21   just talking about these elements, you know, of well, I suppose\n\n22   really what is the status quo.          I took Your Honor's question to\n\n23   be about where is the status quo.\n\n24                THE COURT:     That is the -- that is the question.\n\n25                MR. HAMILTON:     So if we're talking about kind of where\n\n\n               Kassandra L.

And ordering\n\n 2   defendants to take back into the Federal Government tens of\n\n 3   thousands of employees is not preserving the status quo, it's\n\n 4   going back to the status quo that existed at a time that\n\n 5   plaintiffs have chosen, which is January 20th of 2025.            And you\n\n 6   know, also a significant time ago a number of documents that\n\n 7   plaintiffs have submitted don't even involve very recent\n\n 8   terminations.   They're terminations about a month ago.\n\n 9             THE COURT:     You keep saying take back.       You may have\n\n10   removed them from their offices, you may have stopped paying\n\n11   them, you may have sent them a letter that at least under this\n\n12   hypothetical was inoperable because it was unlawful.           I mean, it\n\n13   starts to get sort of metaphysical.        But what is their status?\n\n14   If that's where the court concludes things likely are, legally,\n\n15   then they're still federal employees.\n\n16             MR. HAMILTON:     That isn't -- that isn't how I\n\n17   understand the Federal Government to be treating them though.               I\n\n18   mean, I'm only going off of what the plaintiffs have put in the\n\n19   record which is these 19 letters, and those say that individuals\n\n20   are being separated from the Federal Government.          And so to\n\n21   order them to -- or rather order defendants to treat them as\n\n22   though those letters had not happened would be changing not\n\n23   preserving the status quo right now.\n\n24             THE COURT:     Well, it's all how you look at it.\n\n25       Go ahead.

HAMILTON:     Thank you, Your Honor.\n\n 6             THE COURT:     I appreciate your advocacy.\n\n 7       Ms. Williamson, any rebuttal from movant?\n\n 8             MS. WILLIAMSON:      Yes, Your Honor.     I have just four\n\n 9   points and I'll try to be quick.\n\n10       Point number one, Your Honor, is that my friends on the\n\n11   other side seem to be taking issue with the fact that the\n\n12   plaintiff states have very little information at the moment.\n\n13   They've criticized the presentation to say that we haven't\n\n14   provided enough declarations from defendant agencies.           The\n\n15   states are at an information disadvantage as a result of the\n\n16   defendant's failure to notice.\n\n17       In this case, we relied not only on those individual\n\n18   declarations, which are illustrative not exclusive, but public\n\n19   reporting, the OPM memo, the Executive Order, a variety of other\n\n20   indicators that RIFs occurred here.\n\n21       Your Honor made the point about the terms under which a\n\n22   probationary employee can be fired.        That's -- Your Honor is\n\n23   correct, that there are only three routes.         And I just wanted to\n\n24   also point out that the law requires an honest assessment after\n\n25   a fair trial.   So this isn't just that someone -- someone in the\n\n\n            Kassandra L. McPherson, RPR - Federal Official Court Reporter\n\n                                      JA461\n\f                                  03/12/2025 TRO Hearing                          48\n\n\n 1   government can claim to have fired someone just because they\n\n 2   want to.     It has to be an honest assessment after fair trial.\n\n 3       My third point, Your Honor, is on what the issue of status\n\n 4   quo is.     We cited this in our filing and I would point the Court\n\n 5   to League of Women Voters of North Carolina verse North\n\n 6   Carolina, a Fourth Circuit decision from 2014.             And it says that\n\n 7   the status quo to be preserved by injunctive relief is the\n\n 8   quote, \"Last uncontested status between the parties which\n\n 9   proceeded the controversy.\"\n\n10       So in this case, that would be before the unlawful RIFs\n\n11   that the defendants conducted.\n\n12       Finally, Your Honor, I just want to very briefly touch on\n\n13   Thunder Basin.      There isn't a route for relief if this Court is\n\n14   not that route.       There is no administrative body that could hear\n\n15   the claims of the states here.          Thunder Basin largely focuses,\n\n16   though not exclusively, on the idea of there being a forum to\n\n17   hear a complaint.       And if defendants' arguments are accepted,\n\n18   the states have no route to even seek any form of relief for the\n\n19   injuries they've suffered here.\n\n20       Your Honor, we would ask if the Court has no more questions\n\n21   that the Court enter a temporary restraining order here.\n\n22       Thank you.\n\n23                THE COURT:     Thank you, counsel.

SUMMARY\n\n        When the federal government terminates large numbers of its employees, including those\n\nstill on probation because they were recently hired or promoted, it must follow certain rules. Some\n\nof those rules are intended to help states manage the consequences of sudden, mass layoffs.\n\nWorkers who unexpectedly lose their jobs often need immediate assistance-in applying for\n\nunemployment, in searching for new jobs, and in obtaining essential social services-and\n\nCongress and the government itself recognized as much when they crafted rules meant to give\n\nstates advance notice of big layoffs. Without advance notice and the opportunity to plan, organize,\n\nand reprogram necessary resources, states are harmed.\n\n        In this case, the government conducted massive layoffs, but it gave no advance notice. It\n\nclaims it wasn' t required to because, it says, it dismissed each one of these thousands of\n\nprobationary employees for \"performance\" or other individualized reasons. On the record before\n\nthe Court, this isn' t true. There were no individualized assessments of employees. They were all\n\njust fired. Collectively. Accordingly, in the language of relevant laws, these big government\n\nlayoffs were actually \"Reductions in Force,\" or \"RIFs.\" And, because these were \"RIFs,\" they\n\nhad to be preceded by notice to the states that would be impacted.\n\n       Lacking the notice to which they were entitled, the States weren ' t ready for the impact of\n\nso many unemployed people. They are still scrambling to catch up. They remain impaired in their\n\ncapacities to meet their legal obligations to their citizens.\n\n        Because the federal government' s recent discharge of thousands of probationary\n\nemployees was not executed in compliance with rules intended to ensure that states are ready to\n\nbear the load cast upon them when mass layoffs occur, and because the Plaintiff States are not yet\n\n\n\n\n                                               JA477\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB         Document 43        Filed 03/13/25     Page 4 of 56\n\n\nin fact so prepared, and this because of the violations, the recent directives of various federal\n\nagencies terminating probationary employees must be stayed.\n\n       In the accompanying Temporary Restraining Order, the illegal RIFs are stayed for fourteen\n\ndays, during which the Court will likely consider an application for a preliminary or longer-term\n\ninjunction. The Temporary Restraining Order restores the status quo. Employees purportedly\n\nterminated under the RJFs are returned to the Government' s employ, i.e. , they resume the status\n\nthey enjoyed before the Government acted.\n\n\n\n                                         *      *       *\n\n\n\nII.    INTRODUCTION\n\n       Plaintiffs, which include nineteen states and the District of Columbia (\"the States\"), have\n\nfiled suit against forty-one Defendants, which include cabinet agencies and their secretaries, and\n\nother federal agencies and their heads (\"the Government\"). (See generally ECF No. l .) The States\n\nchallenge the Government's termination of probationary federal employees. Plaintiffs have filed\n\na Motion for Temporary Restraining Order (\"TRO\"). (ECF No. 4.) The parties have filed briefing\n\nand evidence in relation to the Motion. (ECF Nos. 4, 5, 19, 20, 33.) The Court held a Hearing on\n\nthe Motion on March 12, 2025. The Motion will be granted, and a TRO will issue.\n\nID.    BACKGROUND\n\n       A.     Requirements for Terminating Probationary Employees\n\n       In the federal civil service, most employees are considered to be under probationary status\n\nin the first year or two of their employment.       See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 332l(a), 7511 (a)(l)(A)(ji),\n\n75 l l(a)(l )(C)(ii); 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.80 l.

If a probationary employee is\n\ntermjnated because his performance or conduct fails to demonstrate that he is fit for continued\n\nemployment, the agency \"shall terminate his services by notifying him in writing as to why he is\n\nbeing separated and the effective date of the action.

Otherwise, a probationary\n\nemployee may be terminated as part of a reduction in force (\"RJF\"). The parties have not identified\n\nany other method by which a probationary employee may be terminated.\n\n       With respect to a RIF, federal statutes and regulations set forth detailed procedures that\n\nfederal agencies must follow. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502; 5 C.F.R. Part 35 1. The relevant regulations\n\nprovide that \"[eJach agency shall follow this part when it releases a competing employee from hls\n\nor her competitive level by ... separation ... , when the release is required because of lack of\n\nwork; shortage of funds; insufficient personnel ceiling; reorganization; the exercise of\n\nreemployment rights or restoration rights; or reclassification of an employee's position die [sic] to\n\nerosion of duties when such action will take effect after an agency has formally announced a\n\nreduction in force in the employee's competitive area and when the reduction in force will take\n\neffect within 180 days.\" 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.20 l (a)(2).\n\n       When conducting a RIF, an agency must fo llow certain retention preferences, as laid out\n\nm the statute and regulations.

These rapid-response services are designed to cushion the blow of sudden\n\nmass unemployment. See, e.g. , 20 C.F .R. \u00a7 682. l 00 (providing that the Workplace Innovation and\n\nOpportunity Act (\"WIOA'') designates \"both required and allowable activities\"); id. \u00a7 682.200\n\n(identifying \" [r]equired statewide . .. activities,\" including \"rapid response activities\"); id.\n\n\u00a7 682.300(a) (defining \"rapid response\" as \"encompass[ing] the strategies and activities necessary\n\nto,\" among other things, \"[d]eliver services to enable dislocated workers to transition to new\n\nemployment as quickly as possible\"). These federal duties stand alongside the States' own,\n\njurisdiction-specific requirements related to mass unemployment events. See, e.g., Md. Code\n\nAnn. , Lab. & Empl. \u00a7\u00a7 11- 303 to - 04 (setting out Maryland's \"quick response program,\" whose\n\nduties include \"monitor[ing] layoff and employment patterns and payments of unemployment\n\ncompensation contributions to identify employers that are likely to experience large losses in\n\nemployment or a reduction in operations\"); N.J.

Finally, the States also hold background obligations to provide\n\nunemployment and similar benefits. See generally, e.g., Md. Code Ann., Lab. & Empl. \u00a7\u00a7 8- 101\n\nto - 1608; N.J. Stat. Ann.\u00a7\u00a7 43:21- 1 to - 71.\n\n       B.      The Government's Alleged Actions\n\n       On February 11 , 2025, President Trump issued Executive Order 14210, \"Implementing the\n\nPresident's 'Department of Government Efficiency' Workforce Optimization Initiative.\" It set out\n\nas its purpose, \"[b]y eliminating waste, bloat, and insularity, my Administration will empower\n\n\n\n                                                 6\n\n                                             JA482\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 43        Filed 03/13/25      Page 9 of 56\n\n\nAmerican families, workers, taxpayers, and our system of Government itself.\" It provides, inter\n\nalia, that \"Agency Heads shall promptly undertake preparations to initiate large-scale reductions\n\nin force (RIFs), consistent with applicable law, and to separate from Federal service temporary\n\nemployees and reemployed annuitants working in areas that will likely be subject to the RIFs.\"\n\n       On February 11 and 12, various agencies terminated large numbers of probationary\n\nemployees. (ECF No. 1 ,r,r 107- 109.)\n\n       The States allege that, on February 13, \"OPM officials met with agency officials\n\nthroughout the federal government and ordered agencies to lay off nearly all of the federal\n\ngovernment's approximately 220,000 probationary employees.\" (Id. ,r 110.) And, in a February\n\n14 email, Plaintiffs allege that OPM explained to agencies that \"[w]e have asked that you separate\n\nprobationary employees that you have not identified as mission critical no later than the end of the\n\nday Monday, 2/27. We have attached a template letter. The separation date should be as soon as\n\npossible that is consistent with applicable agency policies (including those in CBAs).\" (Id. ,r 11 2.)\n\n       This was followed by several more agencies terminating large numbers of probationary\n\nemployees on February 13 through March 3. (Id. ,r,r 115- 137.)\n\n       All told, the States allege that the Government has terminated at least 24,000 probationary\n\nemployees. (Id. ii 139.) The States were not provided any notice of such terminations from the\n\nrelevant agencies. (Id. 1 148.)\n\n       C.      The States' Alleged Harms\n\n       The States allege several injuries resulting from the Government s failure to follow the RIF\n\nprocedures. They situate these injuries within five distinct categories of harm: ( 1) harms to the\n\nStates' rapid-response protocols, which both federal and state law require the States to develop,\n\n(see ECF No. 4-1 at 21- 22, 33-34; ECF No. 19 at 2-3); (2) harms to the States' administration of\n\n\n\n                                                  7\n\n                                              JA483\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB            Document 43        Filed 03/13/25       Page 10 of 56\n\n\nunemployment benefits, (see ECFNo. 4-1 at 21-22, 34-35; ECF No. 19 at 2- 3); (3) harms to State\n\nprograms that rely on embedded federal workers, (see ECF No. 4-1 at 36-37; ECF No. 19 at 3);\n\n(4) harms to the States' finances, namely, the States' tax bases and various social-services\n\nprograms, including public health insurance, (see ECF No. 4-1 at 23, 37- 38; ECF No. 19 at 4- 5);\n\nand (5) an informational harm that attends the fact of not having received the statutorily required\n\nnotice, (see ECF No. 4-1 at 23, 24; ECF No. 19 at 5-6).\n\n       First, the States allege harms to their rapid-response efforts by virtue of having to \"divert\u25a1\n\nor . .. prepar[e] to divert staff from critical state-funded matters.\" (ECF No. 19 at 2.) They also\n\nallege harms in the form of \"administrative burdens [flowing from] the need to affirmatively\n\ncontact federal agencies, monitor public reporting, and conduct mass outreach to identify impacted\n\nworkers,\" (id. at 2- 3 ( citations omitted)), as well as to \"determine if additional firings will occm\"\n\nand \"attempt to provide services to those employees,\" (ECF No. 4-1 at 22 (collecting affidavits\n\nfrom State labor officials)). For example, the State of Maryland \"created a new website, requiring\n\nsignificant time and expense,\" in order to provide resources to recently terminated federal\n\nemployees. (ECF No.4-5129.) ln the States' telling, these recent costs exceed those they would\n\nhave incurred with proper notice under the RIF statute. (See, e.g., ECF No. 4-5 11 21-22\n\n(Maryland Secretary of Labor asserting that \"[r]eacting after a layoff is far more resource-intensive\n\nthan the advance planning and assistance process required by law,\" and that \"(b]ecause the [State]\n\nhas received no notice of federal RIFs, despite extensive outreach, [it is] dedicating significantly\n\nmore staff, resources, and expenditures to fulfill [its] statutory obligation\").)\n\n       Second, the States allege harms to their unemployment-benefits systems as a direct result\n\nof a surge in the number of claims brought by former federal employees. (See ECF No. 4-1 at 21-\n\n22; 32- 38.) The States offer the following numbers, among others:\n\n\n\n                                                   8\n\n                                              JA484\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 43        Filed 03/13/25      Page 11 of 56\n\n\n       \u2022   Between January 21 and March 3, 2025, Maryland received claims from 813 former\n           federal employees, up 330 percent from the 189 such claims it received during the same\n           period the prior year. (See ECF No. 4-5 11 50, 52.) In \"the last few weeks,\" the State\n           has received 30 to 60 new claims per day. (Id. 1 18.)\n       \u2022   Between February I and March 4, 2025, California received claims from 1,621 fo rmer\n           federal employees, up 149 percent from the 650 such claims it received during the same\n           period the prior year. (See ECF No. 4-7130.)\n       \u2022   Between January 19 and March l , 2025, Illinois received claims from 446 former\n           federal employees, just seven fewer than the 453 such claims it received during the\n           entire 2024 calendar year. (See ECF 4-8 11 15- 16.)\n       \u2022   Between January 21 and February 26, 2025, New Jersey received claims from 388\n           former federal employees, up 273 percent from the 104 such claims it received during\n           the same period the prior year. (See ECF No. 4-11 11 14-15.)\n       \u2022   Between January 2 1 and February 27, 2025, New York received claims from 550\n           former federal employees, a \"significant increase\" from prior numbers. (See ECF No.\n           4-1 31 4.)\n       \u2022   In February 2025, Massachusetts received claims from 251 former federal employees,\n           with a \"significant uptick\" in the latter weeks of that period, including 32 claims on\n           February 24 alone. (ECF No. 4-91116- 17.)\n\nBecause of these increases in claims, the States say they \"are experiencing administrative burdens\n\nand costs,\" including costs related to the processing of numerous additional claims. (ECF No. 19\n\nat 3 (citing ECF No. 4-5 1il 37- 38, 73- 74 (describing how, in Maryland, state money makes up\n\nfor any federal shortfalls in unemployment-related funding)); see also ECF No. 4-5 11 59, 70\n\n(identifying Maryland's added costs not only in processing claims, but in verifying them, especially\n\ngiven scant information about the firings).) And the States fear \"[t]his surge is only beginning,\"\n\ngiven that \"the effective dates for some terminations have not yet passed\" and \" there will [also] be\n\na delay between when individuals are fired and when they likely apply for benefits.\" (See ECF\n\nNo. 4-1 at 21.)\n\n       Beyond the increased burdens on unemployment-benefits services and the ability to fulfill\n\ntheir rapid-response duties, the States separately \"anticipate increased costs to the agencies that\n\nenroll new participants in Medicaid and other health-benefits programs.\" (ECF No. 4-1 at 36.) In\n\nthat context, the expected harms stem from circumstances substantially similar to those described\n\n\n                                                 9\n\n                                             JA485\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 43        Filed 03/13/25      Page 12 of 56\n\n\nabove: a bevy of new and otherwise avoidable administrative tasks, including \"[fJielding questions\n\nfrom terminated employees, processing an unexpected influx of applications, and providing other\n\nhealth-benefits services.\" (See id)\n\n       Third, \"[s]ome Plaintiff States have also lost the benefit of services provided by federal\n\nemployees embedded within state agencies, without any time to prepare.\" (ECF No. I ,r 6.) 1n\n\nNew Jersey and Rhode lsland, for example, federal employees working in the Centers for Disease\n\nControl and Prevention (\"CDC\")'s Public Health Associate Program (\"PHAP\") are embedded in\n\nstate health agencies. (See ECF No. 4-12 ,r 5; ECF No. 4-15 ,r 7.) In New Jersey, three PHAP\n\nassociates, all of whom working on infectious disease tracing, were terminated. (ECF No. 4-12\n\n,r 11.) CDC later reinstated the associates, but one of the three elected not to return. (Id.) New\nJersey was \"unable to prepare for the sudden loss of labor it was relying on to perform crucial\n\npublic health services,'' and, because the associates ' caseloads had to be transferred without any\n\nnotice to staffers who already had full caseloads, there were \"administrative inefficiencies,\n\nduplicative work, and most importantly, delayed notifications to persons exposed to syphilis, HIV,\n\nand TB, which in tum increased the risk of spreading disease in New Jersey.\" (id. ,r 13.) Plaintiffs\n\nprovide similar evidence for Rhode Island, where two PHAP associates were tenninated but then\n\nreinstated. (See generally ECF No. 4-15.)\n\n       Fourth, the States allege that the Government' s actions \"will continue to cause irreparable\n\nharm to Plaintiff States' tax base.\" (ECF No. 4-1 at 37.) According to the Comptroller of\n\nMaryland, for example, \" [a]lthough unemployed individuals receiving unemployment benefits\n\ngenerally pay income tax on their benefits, the benefits paid are less than the amount the\n\nindividuals earned when they were fully employed, and therefore the taxes paid are generally less\n\nthan the taxes paid during their employment.\" (ECF No. 4-38 ,r 5.) She further attests that\n\n\n\n\n                                             JA486\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 43       Filed 03/13/25        Page 13 of 56\n\n\n''hundreds\" of Maryland federal employees have been recently terminated and applied for\n\nunemployment benefits, which will ultimately result in \"significant decreases in Maryland 's\n\nincome tax revenues.\" (Id. ,r,r 7- 8.) Plaintiffs also rely on the analysis of Terry Clower, a public\n\npolicy professor at George Mason University. (ECF No. 4-35.) Dr. Clower estimates that \"the\n\ntermination of 1,000 federal workers in the District [of Columbia] would, over a period of 60 days,\n\nreduce the District's income tax revenues by $320,914 and sales tax revenues by $57,942.\" (Id. ,r\n\n9.) lf the number of terminated employees was 50,000, then the reductions in income and sales\n\ntax    revenues   would    be   approximately     $16   million   and    just   under   $3   million,\n\nrespectively. (id.) Moreover, Dr. Clower estimates that, if fired workers are given the opportunity\n\nto find alternative employment, the tax losses to the District would be significantly lower, (id. ,r\n\n12); the States contend that this analysis shows that \"[h]ad the District received the notice required\n\nby law, these losses would likely have been mitigated, including because some employees would\n\nhave been able to obtain alternative employment prior to their termination.\" (ECF No. 4-1 at 37-\n\n38.)\n\n        Fifth, the States allege a ' textbook informational injury\" because of the Government's\n\nfailure to provide information about RJFs as required by law. (ECF No. 19 at 5.) The States\n\nassert- and the Government does not deny- that the Government did not provide any advance\n\nnotice that it was conducting RIFs, nor did it provide \"information as to the location and\n\ncircumstances of future RIFs\" as required under federal law. (Id.

REVIEW ABILITY\n\n       The Court first examines whether it may review the actions at issue. [t concludes that the\n\nStates--or at least some subset of them- have standing, that there were reviewable final agency\n\nactions, and that Thunder Basin does not preclude review.\n\n       A.      Justiciability\n\n       Article III of the Constitution limits the judicial power of the federal courts to the resolution\n\nof\"Cases\" and \"Controversies.\" U.S. Const., art. III, \u00a7 2, cl. 1. The law has long understood this\n\nlanguage to limit the judiciary to settling \"genuine, live dispute[s] between adverse parties, thereby\n\npreventing the federal courts from issuing advisory opinions.\" Lau.fer v. Naranda Hotels, LLC, 60\n\nF.4th 156, 161 (4th Cir. 2023) (quoting Carney v. Adams, 592 U.S. 53 58 (2020)). When a dispute\n\ndoes not fit that description, it is considered nonjusticiable, see Babbitt v. United Farm Workers\n\nNat 'I Union, 442 U.S. 289, 297 ( 1979), and the federal courts lack subject-matter jurisdiction to\n\ndecide it. See Hamilton v. Pallozzi, 848 F.3d 614, 620-21 (4th Cir. 2017) (citation omitted).\n\n       An \"essential and unchanging part\" of the case-or-controversy limitation is the requirement\n\nof standing. Lujan v. Deft. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992). The standing inquiry is often\n\ncast as asking \"whether the plaintiff is the proper party to bring th[e] suit.\" Raines v. Byrd, 521\n\nU.S. 811 , 818 ( 1997). By ensuring, among other things, that plaintiffs seek relief from only those\n\nacts that affect them in a definite and distinct way, the standing doctrine \"ensures that federa l\n\ncourts decide only 'the rights of individuals,\"' Trans Union LLC v. Ramirez, 594 U.S. 413, 424\n\n(202 1) (quoting Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. 137, 170 (1803)), and therefore exercise only \"their\n\nproper function in a limited and separated government,\" id. (citation omitted). \"Such scrutiny is\n\nnecessary to filter the truly afflicted from the abstractly distressed.\" Friends of the Earth, Inc. v.\n\nGaston Copper Recycling Corp. , 204 F.3d 149, 154 (4th Cir. 2000).\n\n\n\n                                                  12\n\n                                              JA488\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB              Document 43        Filed 03/13/25      Page 15 of 56\n\n\n           To establish standing, a plaintiff must show ( 1) a \"concrete, particularized, and actual or\n\nimminent\" injury in fact; (2) that the injury \"was likely caused by the defendant\"; and (3) that the\n\ninjury \"would likely be redressed by judicial relief.\" TransUnion, 594 U.S. at 423 (citing Lujan,\n\n504 U.S. at 56~ l ). \"If the plaintiff does not claim to have suffered an injury that the defendant\n\ncaused and the court can remedy, there is no case or controversy for the federal court to resolve.\"\n\nId. (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Casillas v. Madison Ave. Assocs., Inc., 926 F.3d\n\n329, 333 (7th Cir. 2019) (Barrett, J.)).\n\n           Here, the States have demonstrated each of the fundamental elements of standing, such that\n\nthey are entitled to invoke federal jurisdiction over their claims. The Court addresses each element\n\nin turn.\n\n                   1.     Injury in Fact\n\n           The States assert five categories of injury: ( I) increased administrative costs associated\n\nwith the hasty roll out of rapid-response protocols, (2) increased administrative costs related to the\n\nburden the dismissals have placed on their unemployment-benefits programs, (3) the loss of the\n\nservices of embedded federal employees, (4) financial harms by way of decreased tax revenue and\n\nincreased public health insurance payouts, and (5) informational harms in the form of not receiving\n\nnotice they had a strong interest in receiving (an argument supported by the foregoing, allegedly\n\navoidable harms). See supra Section LC.\n\n           As an initial matter, for analytical purposes, the Court views these injuries differently than\n\nthe States do. As the States themselves observed at the TRO hearing, the \"central injury\" in this\n\ncase is fundan1entally informational: the States were not given statutorily required notice of the\n\nGovernment's RIFs. For that reason, the other four categories of harm are most naturally\n\nunderstood not as standalone injuries, but as harms flowing from the lack of notice. After all, had\n\n\n\n                                                     13\n\n                                                 JA489\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 43         Filed 03/13/25      Page 16 of 56\n\n\nnotice been provided, those other injuries- at least as the States describe them- would not have\n\nmaterialized. Accordingly, the Court considers the States to assert just one injury, not five.\n\n       That does not mean, however, that the other categories of injury are irrelevant- far from\n\nit. This is because of what is required to establish an informational injury under Article III.\n\n       Informational injury has long been recognized as a valid injury in fact. See, e.g. , Lau.fer.\n\nLLC, 60 F.4th at 163 (collecting cases). And while courts have, from time to time, enforced limits\n\non the justiciability of claims arising from informational banns-often in the context of whether\n\nsuch harms were sufficiently \"concrete,\" see, e.g. , Trans Union, 594 U.S. at 441-42; Fernandez v.\n\nRentGrow, Inc., 116 F.4th 288,300 (4th Cir. 2024)-they have always been open to plaintiffs who\n\n(I) did not receive information they were legally entitled to receive and, as a result~ (2) experienced\n\n\"a ' real' harm with an adverse effect.\" See Dreher v. Experian Info. Sols. , Inc., 856 F.3d 337, 345\n\n(4th Cir. 2017) (quoting Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 578 U.S. 330, 340 (2016)); see also TransUnion,\n\n594 U.S. at 442 (observing that there must be \"'downstream consequences' from failing to\n\nreceive ... required information\" (citation omitted)).\n\n       The States' asserted informational injury satisfies these requirements. First, the plain text\n\nof the relevant statutes and regulations makes clear that the States were legally entitled to notice\n\nof an imminent RIF. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d)(3)(A); 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 35 I.803(b). Not only that, but the\n\nnotice had to contain certain information. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d)(3)(B); 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.803(c).\n\nNowhere does the Government dispute the States' interest on this score-not in its briefing, nor\n\nduring the TRO hearing.\n\n       Second, the States have incurred substantial follow-on harms as a result of the\n\nGovernment's failure to provide the required RlF notice. Chief among these are the increased\n\nburdens associated with the States' flat-footed rollout of rapid-response and unemployment-\n\n\n\n                                                  14\n\n                                              JA490\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB             Document 43      Filed 03/13/25      Page 17 of 56\n\n\nbenefits programs. (See, e.g. , ECF No. 4-51~ 27, 58 (describing costs and delays associated with\n\ndiverting Maryland personnel); ECF No. 4-8124 (similar, but for Illinois).) To fulfill their legal\n\nobligation to provide these services, the States have had to divert money and human resources\n\nfrom existing purposes to new ones- and, because of the lack of notice, have done so less\n\nefficiently than they would otherwise have. That is enough for standing. After all, even on their\n\nown, monetary losses are \"obvious\" concrete harms, see, e.g., TransUnion, 594 U.S. 413 at 425,\n\nsuch that they are also undeniably \"real\" for purposes of informational injury. The same must be\n\ntrue of the diversion and/or loss of various employees' services, whether this stems from internal\n\nemployees being reassigned or embedded ones disappearing; the Court presumes employees are\n\nhired for and placed according to the value they provide- and, accordi11gly, that departure or\n\nplacement into another role, even temporarily, constitutes (at least) a financial loss.\n\n       The Court reaches the same conclusion, albeit on somewhat shakier ground, with respect\n\nto the increased costs associated with a surge in payouts of unemployment claims and other various\n\npublic benefits. The question for these harms is not, of course, whether they are \"concrete\"; they\n\nare, for the same reasons as the financial and labor harms inflicted upon the States' capacity to run\n\ntheir rapid-response and unemployment-benefits programs. The question, rather, is whether they\n\nare sufficiently \"actual or imminent.\"\n\n       On balance, the Court believes they are. Future harm is enough for standing when \"the\n\nthreatened injury is certainly impending, or there is a substantial risk that the harm will occur.\"\n\nDep 't ofCom. v. New York, 588 U.S. 752, 767 (20 19) (quoting Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus,\n\n573 U.S. 149 158 (20 14)). And here, the analysis is straightforward: mass layoffs lead to large\n\nnumbers of unemployed people, and large nun1bers of unemployed people lead to an increase in\n\nthe number of unemployment claims. At this early stage, that is enough, even in view of the fact\n\n\n\n                                                  15\n\n                                              JA491\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 43        Filed 03/13/25      Page 18 of 56\n\n\nthat not every terminated employee will file for unemployment, and that not every employee who\n\ndoes so will be successful. After all, the States have already shown an increase in the number of\n\nbenefits claims coming from former federal employees. And the courts have repeatedly endorsed\n\nsimilar theories of future injury. See, e.g., Dep 't ofCom., 588 U.S. at 766-67 (approving standing\n\ntheory based on ' diminishment of political representation, loss of federal funds, degradation of\n\ncensus data, and diversion ofresources\" due to expected nonresponses to modified census); Texas\n\nv. United States, 809 F.3d 134, 155 (5th Cir. 2015) (holding a State to have standing to challenge\n\na federal immigration law based on the costs of issuing a greater number of driver's licenses), aff'd\n\nby an equally divided court, 579 U.S. 547(2016); State v. Eiden, IO F.4th 538, 547 (5th Cir. 202 I)\n\n(holding a State to have standing because it \"incurs a cost every time it inquires into whether\n\n[someone] satisfies the requirements for a license\" (emphasis in original)). Even so, the Court\n\nnotes the infirmity inherent in all theories of future injury, particularly those that rely on the\n\nanticipated behavior of third parties. See, e.g., Clapper v. Amnesty Int 'f USA , 568 U.S. 398, 414\n\n(2013) (expressing \"reluctance to endorse standing theories that rest on speculation about the\n\ndecisions of independent actors\").\n\n       The only injury the States assert that does not readily present an \"actual or imminent\"\n\ndownstream harm is the loss of tax revenue. The question of when a state or municipality has\n\nstanding to sue on the grounds that a challenged federal action will reduce its tax revenue is a\n\nsomewhat unsettled one. On the one hand, it has long been held that a State cannot establish\n\nstanding by positing a chain of events flowing from the Government's actions that could eventually\n\nlead to decreased tax revenue flowing into the general treasury. See Florida v. Mellon, 273 U.S.\n\n12, 17- 18 (I 927) (rejecting as \"purely speculative, and, at most, only remote and indirect\" the\n\nclaim that a challenged act \"will have the result of inducing potential taxpayers to withdraw\n\n\n\n                                                 16\n\n                                             JA492\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 43        Filed 03/13/25      Page 19 of 56\n\n\nproperty from the state, thereby diminishing the subjects upon which the state power of taxation\n\nmay operate\"). On the other, a State may be able to establish standing when a challenged action\n\nwill cause a \"direct injury in the form of a loss of specific tax revenues.\" Wyoming v. Oklahoma,\n\n502 U.S. 437, 448 ( 1992). The Courts of Appeals are split as to how broadly Wyoming should be\n\nread, compare Sierra Club v. Trump, 977 F.3d 853, 870-----71 (9th Cir. 2020),judgment vacated on\n\nother grounds sub nom. Eiden v. Sierra Club, 142 S. Ct. 56 (202 1), with El Paso County v. Trump,\n\n982 F.3d 332, 339-41 (5th Cir. 2020), and it does not appear that the Fourth Circuit has opined on\n\nthe matter.\n\n       Here, reasonable minds could differ as to whether the States' position places it closer to\n\nthe plaintiff in Florida or in Wyoming. The States' fears of a general \"significant decline in tax\n\nreceipts\" as a result of economic pressures engendered by the terminations is likely too diffuse of\n\nan injury to be cognizable. (ECF No. 19 at 4-5.) The States come closer to the mark, however, in\n\npresenting evidence that the State of Maryland will likely suffer significant lost income tax revenue\n\nas a result of the Government's tem1inations, because individuals receiving unemployment\n\nbenefits pay lower income taxes than those who are fully employed. (ECF No. 4-38 (Declaration\n\nof the Comptroller of Maryland).) But whether this loss is sufficiently directly tied to the RIFs is\n\nunclear.\n\n       Weaknesses in certain theories aside, the Court is satisfied that the States have shown an\n\ninjury in fact based on infom1ational harm. The States have already incurred appreciable financial\n\nand labor costs as a direct result of not receiving notice they were owed, and they will certainly\n\nincur additional costs in the future related to the increased payout of public benefits. And the Court\n\nis unpersuaded by the Government' s argument, reiterated throughout the TRO hearing, that each\n\nof these costs is \"downstream\" and therefore not cognizable under Article III. As the Supreme\n\n\n\n                                                  17\n\n                                             JA493\n\f        Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB                Document 43            Filed 03/13/25          Page 20 of 56\n\n\nCourt has made clear, a ' real,\" downstream harm is a critical component of an informational\n\ninjury- hardly a circumstance that destroys one. See, e.g. , Trans Union, 594 U.S. at 442; see also\n\nDreher, 856 F.3d at 345 (citing Spokeo, 578 U.S. at 340). For that reason, particularly in this\n\nexpedited posture, the Court need not say definiti vely which theories of injury ought not survive\n\nfor the duration of the litigation; at least one valid theory is enough. 3\n\n         The Court is also unmoved by the Government' s appeal to what it calls \"the extraordinary\n\nbreadth of the States' suit,\" an argument the Government appears to raise in support of its view\n\nthat the States have not identified a particularized injury. (See ECF No. 20 at 13- 14.)\n\n         To buttress this argument, the Government likens this action to Murthy v. Missouri, in\n\nwhich several plaintiff states- all of which had sought a preliminary injunction barring federal\n\nofficials from pressuring social media platforms to suppress free speech- were held to lack\n\nstanding. 603 U.S. 43 (2024). True, this case, like Murthy, is a \"sprawling\" suit in which \"dozens\n\nof Executive Branch officials and agencies\" have been sued. Id. at 49, 61 . But while massive and\n\nunusual suits may legitimately invite closer judicial scrutiny than more run-of-the-mill ones, there\n\nis of course no per se rule that such actions are impermissible.\n\n         And besides, the scale of the two suits is where the similarities between this case and\n\nMurthy end. In Murthy, the crux of the standing problem was twofold: First, the plaintiffs could\n\nnot establish that any harm- suppression of free speech protected by the First Amendment- was\n\nfairly traceable to the governmental defendants, rather than to the (nonparty) social media\n\nplatforms who actually made the decision to restrict their speech. 603 U.S. at 62- 68. Second, in\n\n\n\n\n3 For similar reasons, and in light of the fact that the Court would order nationwide relief even if just a single State\n\nhad standing to press these claims, see inji-a Section lV.B, the Court need not detennine which States, if any, do not\nhave standing to go the distance in this action. For the limited purposes of this TRO, it is enough for one State to be\nable to invoke the jurisdiction of this Court. The Court is satisfied that at least some subset of the States- namely,\nMaryland- has done so.\n\n                                                          18\n\n                                                      JA494\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 43        Filed 03/13/25      Page 21 of 56\n\n\nMurthy the plaintiffs sought prospective relief against future alleged suppression campaigns, but\n\nthere was no evidence that the government was continuing its alleged pressure campaign or was\n\nlikely to do so in the future. Id. at 68- 72. This case is completely different. First, w1like in\n\nMurthy, where only prospective relief was sought and it was doubtful that plaintiffs would suffer\n\nany future injuries, here the harm is happening right now, and can only be remedied by immediate\n\ninjw1ctive relief. More fundamentally, unlike in Murthy, the alleged chain of causation does not\n\ndepend upon the actions of third parties not before the Court. Instead, the allegations are simply\n\nthat the Government failed to provide the States information to which they are statutorily entitled,\n\nand that because of this failure States have been forced to expend resources that they would not\n\notherwise have had to expend. This distinction also goes to redressability. In Murthy, it was not\n\nclear how a favorable court order would redress the injuries claimed, as nothing in the order would\n\nprevent the nonparty social media platforms from continuing to suppress the plaintiffs' speech. Id.\n\nat 73- 74 (\" [T]he platforms remain free to enforce, or not to enforce, those policies-even those\n\ntainted by initial governmental coercion. The platforms are not parties to the suit, and there is no\n\nreason they should be obliged to honor an incidental legal determination the suit produced.\"\n\n(cleaned up)). Such concerns are simply not at issue here.\n\n               2.      Causation\n\n       To start, it is plain that at least some of the harms the States have experienced- namely,\n\nthe increase in the cost of administering certain state programs, irrespective of what those programs\n\nwill be required to pay out- are direct and foreseeable results of the agencies' failures to provide\n\nRIF notices. The Government does not argue otherwise. (See ECF No. 20 at 12- 17.) Accordingly,\n\non that basis alone, the Court is confident there is no causation defect that would wholly defeat the\n\nStates' standing.\n\n\n\n                                                 19\n\n                                             JA495\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 43       Filed 03/13/25       Page 22 of 56\n\n\n\n        As for the harms based on the expected increase in public benefits awards and future lost\n\ntax revenues, the Government argued during the TRO hearing that these harms were self-inflicted.\n\nThe Court disagrees. Costs that States incur in the satisfaction of a mandatory legal duty, even\n\none arising under state law, are not self-inflicted. See, e.g. , Texas, 809 F.3d at 155. And here,\n\nlegal duties arise under both federal and state law. See, e.g. , 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 682.100- .300 (providing\n\ncertain duties under the Workplace Innovation and Opportunity Act); Md. Code Ann. , Lab. &\n\nEmpl. \u00a7\u00a7 11- 303 to - 04 (setting out Maryland' s \"quick response program\" with respect to mass\n\nunemployment events); N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 34:21-5 (similar, but for New Jersey).\n\n        Causation is also not defeated by certain theories' reliance on the anticipated behavior of\n\nthird parties. This element is satisfied when \"third parties will likely react in predictable ways to\n\nthe\" conduct at issue. See Dep 't ofCom. , 588 U.S. at 768. For much the same reason the States'\n\nappeal to future increased benefits payouts was \"actual or imminent\" for purposes of injury in fact,\n\nthat harm is traceable to the Government's terminations: mass layoffs mean more unemployed\n\npeople, more unemployed people means more unemployment claims.                     That is textbook\n\npredictability.\n\n                  3.   Redressability\n\n        Finally, the States have shown their harms to be redressable by the relief sought. To satisfy\n\nthis element, \"it must be 'likely,' as opposed to merely 'speculative/ that the injury will be\n\n'redressed by a favorable decision.'\" Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561 (quoting Simon v. Eastern Ky. Welfare\n\nRights Org. , 426 U.S. 26, 38, 43 (1976)).\n\n        As established above, the States' injuries were caused by the lack of RIF notice. That\n\ncircumstance, standing alone, might lead one to conclude that the appropriate remedy- and, for\n\nthat matter, the only one the States would have standing to seek- is notice, albeit overdue.\n\n\n\n                                                 20\n\n                                             JA496\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 43         Filed 03/13/25      Page 23 of 56\n\n\n       But this ignores the nature of the States injuries. While the initial harm was caused by a\n\nlack of notice, the States' informational harm includes at least some of the serious downstream\n\nharms the States assert. Thus, those downstream injuries must be considered in the redressability\n\nanalysis.\n\n       The remedy the States seek is to set aside the Government's allegedly unlawful RIFs-a\n\nremedy which, in effect, would require the reinstatement of the terminated employees. (See ECF\n\nNo. I 11242-43.) The Government appears to agree. (See, e.g., ECF No. 20 at 14 (\" [T]he States'\n\nasserted injuries could only be conceivably redressed by their reinstatement.\" (emphasis in\n\noriginal).) So, too, does the Court. After all, the States' injuries are the result of the increasing\n\npressure on States' rapid-response, unemployment, and other public programs.               Were the\n\nterminated employees to be reinstated, that pressure would abate. That is enough for redressability.\n\n       B.      Jurisdiction\n\n               I.      Final Agency Action\n\n       The Court begins by clarifying the conduct at issue in this case, at least for purposes of the\n\npending TRO request. The States challenge two distinct federal actions: first, the OPM directives\n\nthat allegedly directed other federal agencies to dismiss probationary employees en masse; and\n\nsecond, the actual, agency-level dismissals of those employees without notice. (ECF No. 4-1 at\n\n24-25.) But the nub of this lawsuit is the lack of notice the States received with respect to the RJF\n\nprovisions. (See, e.g., ECF No. 19 at 3 (\"The strain on Plaintiffs' rapid response systems is directly\n\ntraceable to Defendants' unlawful RlFs, conducted without the required advanced notice.\")). And\n\nthe agency actions that are most proximate to that harm are the dismissals without notice, not the\n\nOPM directives, for one simple reason: under the RIF regulations, notice must come from the\n\ndismissing agencies, not from OPM, except as it concerns OPM's dismissals of its own\n\n\n\n                                                 21\n\n                                              JA497\n\f        Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB                Document 43            Filed 03/13/25         Page 24 of 56\n\n\nemployees. See 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351 .803(b). For that reason, this Memorandum focuses on the\n\nunnoticed dismissals, though the Court makes no final determination at present as to which actions\n\nare appropriately reviewed in this litigation.\n\n         \"Judicial review under the (Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\")] is limited to review of\n\n'final agency action.\"' NAACP v. Bureau of the Census, 945 F.3d 183, 189 (4th Cir. 2019)\n\n(quoting 5 U. S.C. \u00a7 704). But, as explained below, the unnoticed dismissals fall squarely within\n\nthat category. Accordingly the APA poses no jurisdictional obstacle to this Court's review of the\n\nStates' claims. 4\n\n         To start, \"agency action\" is a capacious term, \"cover[ing] comprehensively every manner\n\nin which an agency may exercise its power.\" Whitman v. Am. Trucking Ass 'ns, 53 1 U.S. 457, 478\n\n(200 l ) (citation omitted). And while the Government refers to the acts at issue as \"alleged final\n\nagency actions,\" (ECF No. 20 at 14, 23), it does not otherwise dispute that the dismissals are\n\n\"agency actions ' within the meaning of the APA's review provision. Nor could it. See, e.g. ,\n\nBurdue v. FAA , 774 F.3d 1076, 1080 (6th Cir. 20 14) (\"[An agency employee's] tennination is ...\n\nagency action for purposes of the [APA].\").\n\n         As for \"finality,\" an action is \"final\" whenever two conditions are satisfied: (1) the action\n\nis the \"consummation of the agency's decisionmaking process,\" and (2) the action is one \"by which\n\nrights or obligations have been detem1ined or from which legal consequences will flow.'' NAACP,\n\n945 F.3d at 189 (ultimately quoting Bennett v. Sp ear, 520 U.S. 154, 177- 78 (1997)). The firings\n\nwithout notice undeniably meet this standard, as any agency's decision to dismi ss an employee\n\n\n\n4\n Notably, the requirement of\"final agency action\" applies only to the States's two A PA claims, not their ultra vires\nclaim . This is because the right of action for an ultra vires claim flows from the federal courts' equity jurisdiction,\nnot from the APA. See, e.g., PFLAG, Inc. v. Trump, Civ. No. BAH-25-337, 2025 WL 685 124, at *9 & n.26 (D. Md.\nMar. 4, 2025) (citing Trudeau v. FTC, 456 F.3d 178, 187 (D.C. Cir. 2006)). That said, for purposes of the pend ing\nTRO request, the Court addresses the merits only of the States' APA claim s, not their more unusual ultra vires claim,\ndespite jurisdiction to consider each. See infra Secti on Ill.A.\n\n                                                          22\n\n                                                      JA498\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB            Document 43         Filed 03/13/25      Page 25 of 56\n\n\neffects self-evident legal consequences for both parties and plainly marks the end of the agency's\n\ndecisionmaking with respect to the employee involved. See, e.g., Burdue, 774 F.3d at 1080; cf\n\nAm. Fed 'n ofGov 't Emps., AFL-C/O v. OPM, Civ. No. WHA-25-1780, 2025 WL 660053, at *5\n\n(N.D. Cal. Feb. 28, 2025) (\"OPM' s direction to the other agencies [to dismiss probationary\n\nemployees] constituted a final agency action for the purposes of the APA.\").\n\n        The Court therefore bas jurisdiction to review each of the States' claims, at least insofar as\n\nthey concern dismissals without notice.\n\n                2.      Claim Channeling\n\n        The Government argues that the Court has no jurisdiction to hear the States' claims because\n\nof an alternative administrative review structure set up by Congress.\n\n        ln Thunder Basin Coal Co. v. Reich, 5 l O U.S. 200 (1994), the Supreme Court articulated\n\na two-step analytical framework to assess whether Congress impliedly divested the district courts\n\nof jurisdiction to hear challenges to an agency action.\n\n        First, a reviewing comt asks whether some statute, either explicitly or implicitly, channels\n\ncertain claims about agency action away from the courts and into an administrative agency. See\n\nAxon Enter., Inc. v. FTC, 598 U.S. 175, 185 (2023); Bennell v. SEC, 844 F.3d 174, 181 (4th Cir.\n\n20 I 6). This inquiry \"involves examining the statute's text, structure, and purpose.\" Bennett, 844\n\nF.3d at 181 (citing Elgin v. Dep 't of Treasury, 567 U.S. l, 10 (2012)).\n\n       Second, if the reviewing court determines that a statute does channel certain claims away\n\nfrom the courts, it then considers whether the specific claims at issue fall within that category. See\n\nAxon, 598 U.S. at 185- 86; see also id. at 186 (\"The ultimate question is how best to understand\n\nwhat Congress has done-whether the statutory review scheme, though exclusive where it applies,\n\nreaches the claim in question.\"). In essence, the court's task is \"to decide if a claim is 'of the type'\n\n\n\n                                                  23\n\n                                               JA499\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB            Document 43        Filed 03/13/25      Page 26 of 56\n\n\nCongress thought belonged within a statutory scheme.\" Id. at 188- 89 (quoting Thunder Basin,\n\n510 U.S. at 212). Only in \"limited circumstances\" is a claim not \"of th[at] type,\" Arch Coal, Inc.\n\nv. Acosta, 888 F.3d 493, 500 (D.C. Cir. 20 18), given that procedures \"designed to permit agency\n\nexpertise to be brought to bear on particular problems\" ought ordinarily to be understood as\n\nexclusive. See Free Enter. Fund v. Pub. Co. Acct. Oversight Bd , 561 U.S. 477, 489 (20 10)\n\n(quoting Whitney Nat '/ Bankv. Bank ofNew Orleans & Trust Co., 379 U.S. 411,420 (1965)).\n\n       To assess whether such \"limited circumstances\" are present in an individual case, courts\n\napply the three so-called Thunder Basin factors: ( l ) whether precluding district court jurisdiction\n\nwould \"foreclose all meaningful judicial review\" of the claims, (2) whether the claims are \"wholly\n\ncollateral to [the] statute' s review provisions,\" and (3) whether the claims are \"outside the agency's\n\nexpertise.\" Axon, 598 U.S. at 186 (alteration in original) (quoting Thunder Basin, 510 U.S. at 2 12-\n\n13). \"When the answer to all three questions is yes, ' [the court] presume[s] that Congress does\n\nnot intend to limit jurisdiction,\"' id. (quoting Free Enter. Fund, 561 U.S. at 489), though a claim\n\nmay be judicially reviewable even if the factors \" point in different directions,\" id.\n\n       As both the States and the Government observe, Congress has provided for the exclusive\n\nadministrative review of most employment claims brought by federal employees, thus satisfying\n\nthe first step of the two-step framework. Two statutory review schemes are relevant here. The\n\nfirst is set out in the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (\"FSMLRS\"), itself set\n\nout in Title VII of the Civil Service Reform Act (\"CSRA\"), Pub. L. No. 95-454, \u00a7 70 1, 92 Stat.\n\n1111, 11 91-2 16 (1978) (codified at 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7101- 35). As the District of D.C. recently\n\nexplained in a similar context, the FSMLRS\n\n       governs labor relations between the executive branch and its employees. It \"grants\n       federal employees the right to organize and bargain collectively, and it requires that\n       unions and federal agencies negotiate in good faith over certain matters.\" Am.\n       Fed'n o/Gov 't Emps., AFL-CJO v. Trump , 929 F.3d 748, 752 (D.C. Cir. 201 9). The\n\n\n                                                 24\n\n                                              JA500\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 43        Filed 03/13/25    Page 27 of 56\n\n\n       [FSMLRS] further \"establishes a scheme of administrative and judicial\n       review.\" Id. Under that scheme, the Federal Labor Relations Authority (\"FLRA\"),\n       a three-member agency charged with adjudicating federal labor disputes, reviews\n       matters including \"negotiability\" and \"unfair labor practice\" disputes. See 5 U.S.C.\n       \u00a7 7105(a). When reviewing unfair labor practice complaints, \"the FLRA resolves\n       whether an agency must bargain over a subject, violated the duty to bargain in good\n       faith, or otherwise failed to comply with the Statute.\" Trump, 929 F.3d at 752\n       (citing 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7105(a)(2)(G), 7116(a), 7118).\n\n       Direct review of the FLRA' s decisions is available in the courts of appeals. 5\n       U.S.C. \u00a7 7 l 23(a). The D.C. Circuit has repeatedly held that this scheme \"provides\n       the exclusive procedures by which federal employees and their bargaining\n       representatives may assert federal labor-management relations claims.\" Trump,\n       929 F.3d at 755 (quoting AFG\u00a3 v. Secy of the Air Force, 716 F.3d 633, 636 (D.C.\n       Cir. 2013)).\n\nNat 'I Treasury Emps. Union v. Trump, Civ. No. CRC-25-420, 2025 WL 561080, at *4 (D.D.C.\n\nFeb. 20, 2025).\n\n       The second statutory review scheme is set out elsewhere in the CSRA, which separately\n\n\"established a comprehensive system for reviewing personnel action taken against federal\n\nemployees.\" See Elgin, 567 U.S. at 5 (citation omitted). Under those provisions,\n\n       [i]f an agency takes a final adverse action against an employee- removal,\n       suspension for more than [fourteen] days, reduction in grade or pay, or furlough for\n       [thirty] days or less, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7512- the employee may appeal to the Merit\n       Systems Protection Board (\"MSPB\"). 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513(d). The MSPB may order\n       relief to prevailing employees, including reinstatement, backpay, and attorney's\n       fees. Id. \u00a7\u00a7 l 204(a)(2), 770 1(g). Probationary employees, however, generally do\n       not enjoy a right to appeal to the MSPB. Id.\u00a7 751 l(a)( l). Employees may appeal\n       final MSPB decisions to the Federal Circuit, which has \"exclusive jurisdiction\"\n       over such appeals. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(9). This statutory review scheme, too, is\n       \"exclusive, even for employees who bring constitutional challenges to federal\n       statutes.\" Elgin, 567 U.S. at 13.\n\nNat 'I Treaswy Emps. Union, 2025 WL 561080, at *5.\n\n        Notwithstanding the existence of two exclusive statutory review schemes, the Court\n\nconcludes that, under the three Thunder Basin factors, those schemes do not foreclose district-\n\ncourtjurisdiction over the States' claims in this case.\n\n\n\n                                                 25\n\n                                              JA501\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 43        Filed 03/13/25      Page 28 of 56\n\n\n\n       On the first factor, foreclosure of meaningful judicial review, it is clear the States\n\nprevail. The Government argues that \"any affected party\" may challenge the RIF dismissals\n\n\"within the administrative scheme\" Congress has provided. (ECF No. 20 at 19.) But that\n\nargument is defeated by the plain text of the statutory scheme the Government cites, which\n\nforecloses any possibility of the States bringing their claims before an administrative agency. In\n\nrelevant part, the FLRA has the authority to \"conduct hearings and resolve complaints of unfair\n\nlabor practices,'' 5 U .S.C. \u00a7 7105(a)(2)(G), charges of which may be brought \" by any person,\" id.\n\n\u00a7 7118(a)(l); see also id. \u00a7 712l(g)(3)-(4) (referring to the ability of \"a person\" to appeal to the\n\nMSPB, among other remedies). Yet the labor-management relations chapter of the CSRA defines\n\na \"person\" as \"an individual, labor organization, or agency\"- not a State.                5 U.S.C.\n\n\u00a7 7103(a)(l). Similarly, the MSPB may hear appeals from \"[a]n employee, or applicant for\n\nemployment,' id. \u00a7 7701; see also id. \u00a7 7513(d) (permitting appeals by 'employee[s]\")-again,\n\ncategories that could not plausibly include States. Cf id. \u00a7 7103(a)(2) (defining \"employee,\" for\n\npurposes of the labor-management chapter, as either an individual \"employed in an agency\" or an\n\nindividual whose employment \"has ceased because of any unfair labor practice,'' as described\n\nelsewhere in the statute).\n\n       Beyond being unable to seek review by any agencies, the States are also foreclosed from\n\nseeking judicial review of agency decisions. While the Government is correct that the Federal\n\nCircuit has exclusive jurisdiction over challenges to the final decisions of the MSPB, (see ECF\n\nNo. 20 at 19 (citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(9))), the MSPB 's own statute shows thatjudicial review\n\nis available only for \" employee[s] or applicant[s]for employment affected or aggrieved\" by the\n\nMSPB 's decisions, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(a)( I) (emphasis added). Likewise, although the Courts of\n\n\n\n\n                                                26\n\n                                             JA502\n\f        Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB                  Document 43            Filed 03/13/25           Page 29 of 56\n\n\nAppeals have exclusive jurisdiction over review of most final orders of the FLRA, such review is,\n\nagain, available only for \"[a]ny person aggrieved\" by such orders. Id. \u00a7 7123(a).\n\n         [n short, the Government supplies no authority for the proposition that a State would be\n\nable to seek review in any relevant setting- and, indeed, conceded during the TRO hearing that\n\nnone could. 5 This shortcoming alone is arguably fatal to the Government's position, given that\n\n' meaningful judicial review is the most important factor in the Thunder Basin analysis.\" Bennett,\n\n844 F.3d at 183 n.7 (collecting cases). If the Government were correct, then Congress would have\n\ncreated a statutory entitlement for States to be provided notice under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d)(3)(A)(i),\n\nbut provided no judicial review to vindicate that entitlement, a conclusion contrary to the \"strong\n\npresumption that Congress intends judicial review ofadministrative action.\" Bowen v. Mich. A cad.\n\nofFam. Physicians, 476 U.S. 667,670 (1986).\n\n         The second factor, claims' collaterality to the statutory review provisions, likewise favors\n\nthe States. For its part, the Government argues the States seek to \"interject themselves into the\n\nemployment relationship between the United States and government workers.\" (ECF No. 20 at\n\n3.) But that ignores that the States have suffered unique harms, peculiar to their status as states,\n\nirrespective of those harms' connection with the agency-employee relationship. See 5 U.S.C.\n\n\u00a7 3502(d); 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.803 ; see also supra Sections I.A, .C. For that reason, the Government's\n\nreference to parallel proceedings before the MSPB and Office of Special Counsel (\"OSC\"), (see\n\n\n5\n  Likewise, the Government supplies no authority for the related (but equally dubious) proposition that the CSRA\nwholly divests the district courts ofjurisdiction to offer reinstatement as a remedy, (see, e.g., ECF No. 20 at 14), rather\nthan the more limited view that the CSRA divests the courts ofjurisdiction to offer that remedy to specific parties. This\nlatter view is the better interpretation of the CSRA ' s preclusive scope. See, e.g., Elgin, 567 U.S. at 13 (explaining that\nthe CSRA ' s review is exclusive as it concerns federal employees, w ithout any indication that it is exclusive as to\nreinstatement); (see also ECF No. 20 at 14 n.6 (conceding that the district courts do have jurisdiction over Title VII\nclaims, which may lead to reinstatement)). Perhaps that is why, when making hay of the fact that two other courts\nrecognized a lack of jurisdiction to entertain certain claims for reinstatement, (see ECF No. 20 at 3 (first citing Nat '/\nTreasury Emps. Union, 2025 WL 56 I 080; and then citing Am. Fed'n of Gov 't Emps., 2025 WL 660053)), the\nGovernment completely elides the fact that those claims were brought by fundamentally different parties -namely,\nemployees and their unions.\n\n                                                            27\n\n                                                        JA503\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 43         Filed 03/13/25       Page 30 of 56\n\n\nECF No. 20 at 10), is unavailing. As the Supreme Court has explained, \"decid[ing] when a\n\nparticular claim is ' of the type' to fall outside a statutory review scheme .. . requires considering\n\nthe nature of the claim, not the status (pending or not) of an agency proceeding.\" Axon, 598 U.S.\n\nat 194 (emphasis added) (quoting Thunder Basin, 510 U.S. at 212). Indeed, Thunder Basin\n\n\"contemplates ... that even when a proceeding is pending, an occasional claim may get immediate\n\nreview- in part because it involves something discrete.\" Id. What's more, Axon pennitted\n\njudicial review of claims directed at ongoing proceedings involving the very parties seeking\n\njudicial review, see id. at 193- 94-in other words, claims much closer (and therefore less\n\ncollateral) to an administrative proceeding than are the States' claims in this case, particularly\n\ngiven that the States have no administrative remedy available to them.\n\n       The third and final factor, the agencies' expertise, is a closer call, but likely also breaks for\n\nthe States. Again, there is no mechanism for the States to obtain administrative review before the\n\nMSPB, the FLRA, or the OSC. There is thus little reason to think those agencies hold special\n\nexpertise over the States' claims. On the contrary, the States' claims \" raise 'standard questions of\n\nadministrative' . .. law, detached from ' considerations of agency policy.\"' Axon, 598 at 194\n\n(quoting Free Enter. Fund, 561 U.S. at 491). And while the MSPB, FLRA, and OSC \"know[] a\n\ngood deal about\" unlawful dismissal of federal employees, they know \"nothing special about\" the\n\ncentral problem the States have asserted: a fai lure to provide proper notice under the RIF\n\nstatute. Cf id. And as the Court has by now made clear, that the States' problem connects with\n\nunlawful dismissals hardly means those dismissals are the subject of this suit.\n\n       The Government argues, unpersuasively, that the fact someone can seek review of similar\n\nclaims is enough to disclaim jurisdiction over the States' action. (See ECF No. 20 at 21 (\"[T]he\n\nCSRA and FSL-MRS schemes provide for meaningful judicial review over the very claims\n\n\n\n                                                  28\n\n                                              JA504\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB            Document 43        Filed 03/13/25       Page 31 of 56\n\n\nasserted by the States, even if the States themselves are not the proper parties to assert them.\").)\n\nThere are multiple problems with this theory. First, as explained above, while certain facts are\n\ncommon to the States' action and any administrative actions that might be brought by terminated\n\nemployees, the States' interests remain substantially different from the employees' , as evinced by\n\nthe presence of harms that only states qua states can experience. Second, it is hard to swallow that\n\nthe States, to redress their harms, must simply hope and wait for scores of terminated federal\n\nemployees to pursue administrative relief. For one, the States are suffering precisely the sort of\n\n\"here-and-now injury\" that favors prompt judicial review. See Axon, 598 U. S. at 191 (quoting\n\nSeila Law LLC v. CFPB, 591 U.S. 197, 212 (2020)). For another, it is highly doubtful that solo\n\nemployees or their unions would or could adequately represent the States' peculiar interests in an\n\nadministrative setting. For the States' harms to be fully redressed in that manner, it would seem\n\nto require every employee who was dismissed without notice to pursue (and win) administrative\n\nrelief, either individually or collectively, such that the pressure on state unemployment programs\n\nwould eventually, and in piecemeal fashion, be alleviated. The Court is not prepared to accept that\n\ntheory as reality.\n\n        In sum, the CSRA does not preclude this Court's jurisdiction over the States' claims. Time\n\nand again, the courts have been firm: \"Congress rarely allows claims about agency action to escape\n\neffective judicial review.\" Axon, 598 U.S. at 186 (citing Bowen, 476 U.S. at 670); accord Abbott\n\nLab ys v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 140 (1967) (collecting cases, and observing that \"judicial review\n\nof a final agency action . . . will not be cut off unless there is persuasive reason to believe that such\n\nwas the purpose of Congress\"); see also 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702 (\"A person suffering legal wrong because\n\nof agency action . . . is entitled to judicial review thereof.\"). Here, remarkably, the Government\n\nargues that not only is there no judicial review for the States, there is no review of any kind. That\n\n\n\n                                                   29\n\n                                               JA505\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 43         Filed 03/13/25      Page 32 of 56\n\n\nis a startling state of affairs indeed-and one that basic principles of administrative law require\n\nthis Court to reject.\n\nV.      TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER\n\n        Having determined that the Court has jurisdiction to hear this case, the Court turns to the\n\nfactors necessary for issuance of a TRO.\n\n        \"The standard for a temporary restraining order is the same as a preliminary injunction.\"\n\nMaages Auditorium v. Prince George 's County, 4 F. Supp. 3d 752, 760 n.1 (D. Md. 2014), aff'd,\n\n681 F. App' x 256 (4th Cir. 2017). The party seeking a temporary restraining order \"must establish\n\nthat he is likely to succeed on the merits, that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence\n\nof preliminary relief, that the balance of equities tips in his favor, and that an injunction is in the\n\npublic interest.\" Winter v. Nat. Res. Def Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008). Although Plaintiffs\n\n\"need not establish a 'certainty of success,\"' they must \"make a clear showing that (they are] likely\n\nto succeed at trial.\" Di Biase v. SPX Corp., 872 F.3d 224, 230 (4th Cir. 2017) (quoting Pashby v.\n\nDelia, 709 F.3d 307, 321 (4th Cir. 2013)). A TRO is \"an extraordinary remedy that may only be\n\nawarded upon a clear showing that the plaintiff is entitled to such relief.\" Winter, 555 U.S. at 22.\n\n        The Court concludes that the States have established all four factors, and that a TRO is\n\nwarranted.\n\n        A.      Likelihood of Success on the Merits\n\n        The States are very likely to succeed on the merits of (at least) their APA contrary-to-law\n\nclaim. Under the APA, a court shall \"hold unlawful and set aside agency action ... found to be . ..\n\narbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\" 5 U.S.C.\n\n\u00a7 706(2)(A). For purposes of a contrary-to-law claim, the legal standards against which the federal\n\ngovernment's conduct is assessed are supplied not by the APA itself, but by a separate statute-in\n\n\n\n                                                  30\n\n                                              JA506\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB             Document 43      Filed 03/13/25       Page 33 of 56\n\n\nthis case, the RlF statute, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502. The Court concludes that the States are highly likely\n\nto show that they are within the zone of interests of the RJF statute, that the Government conducted\n\nRlFs, and that, when doing so, it wholly failed to comply with the statutory and regulatory demand\n\nthat notice be provided to the States.\n\n               1.      Zone of Interests\n\n       In general, statutory protections \"extend \u25a1 only to plaintiffs whose interests 'fall within the\n\nzone of interests protected by the law invoked,\" ' whether or not a statute is invoked under the\n\nAP A. Lexmark Int 'l, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc. , 572 U.S. 118, 129 (2014) (quoting\n\nAllen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 751 (1984)). Nevertheless, \"in the APA context, that ... test is not\n\n' especially demanding.\"' Id. at 130 (quoting Match- E-Be- Nash-She- Wish Band of Pottawatomi\n\nIndians v. Patchak, 567 U.S. 209, 225 (20 12)). All it requires is that a plaintiffs interest be\n\n\"arguably within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated'' by the underlying\n\nstatute. Match- E- Be- Nash-She- Wish Band, 567 U.S. at 224 (emphasis added) (quoting Ass 'n of\n\nData Processing Serv. Orgs., Inc. v. Camp, 357 U.S. 150, 153 (1970)). Indeed, \"[t]he test\n\nforecloses suit only when a plaintiffs ' interests are so marginally related to or inconsistent with\n\nthe purposes implicit in the statute that it cannot reasonably be assumed that Congress intended to\n\npennit the suit. ' \" Id. at 225 (quoting Clarke v. Sec. Indus. Ass 'n, 497 U.S. 388, 399 (1987)).\n\n       Far beyond merely coming within the legal \"zone of interests,\" the States' interests in this\n\ncase strike at the very heart of the RIF provisions.\n\n       For one, the statute expressly identifies States and the notice they are due. See 5 U.S.C.\n\n\u00a7 3502(d)(3)(A)(i) (\"Notice ... shall be given to ... the State or entity designated by the State to\n\ncarry out rapid response activities under ... the [Workplace Innovation and Opportunity Act\n\n(\"WIOA\")].\"); see also 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.803(b) (similar). It also describes precisely what must be\n\n\n\n                                                 31\n\n                                              JA507\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 43        Filed 03/13/25      Page 34 of 56\n\n\nshared with the States. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d)(3)(B) (requiring notice of \"the nwnber of\n\nemployees to be separated from service\" due to a RIF, \" broken down by geographic area or on\n\nsuch other basis as may be required by\" other regulations; \"when those separations will occur\";\n\nand \"any other matter which might facilitate the delivery of rapid response assistance or other\n\nservices under ... the [WIOA]\"); see also 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 35 l .803(c) (similar). Based on the text of\n\nthe statute alone, Congress clearly envisioned for the States an important role in the RIF process.\n\n       Beyond occupying a place of prominence in the RIF statutory text, the States also hold\n\nlegal duties under the WIOA and its implementing regulations to offer rapid-response services to\n\nalleviate the societal stresses brought on by sudden mass unemployment. As the Court has\n\ndiscussed above, see supra Section I.A, the States are required by federal law to respond to assist\n\nworkers in finding new employment. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 682.200. The States have their own binding\n\nrequirements regarding rapid-response activities. See. e.g. , Md. Code Ann., Lab. & Empl. \u00a7\u00a7 11-\n\n303 to -04. And the States provide unemployment and similar benefits to their own citizens. See\n\ngenerally, e.g. , Md. Code Ann., Lab. & Empl. \u00a7\u00a7 8- 101 to - 1608; N.J. Stat. Ann.\u00a7\u00a7 43:2 1- 1 to-\n\n71.\n\n       All of this underscores the general proposition that the States have important- indeed,\n\nmandatory- uses for RIF notice from the Government, and therefore strong interests in such notice\n\nbeing provided on time and in full. It would defy common sense to say these are not among those\n\ninterests 'arguably\" protected by the RIF provisions. See Malch- E- Be- Nash-She- Wish Band,\n\n567 U.S. at 224.\n\n               2.     The Agencies Conducted RIFs\n\n       Having determined that the States may bring this action under the APA, the Court turns to\n\nthe substantive core of this case-whether the States are likely to succeed in showing that the\n\n\n\n                                                32\n\n                                            JA508\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 43        Filed 03/13/25      Page 35 of 56\n\n\nGovernment's mass terminations, without providing notice to the States, were unlawful. The\n\nGovernment makes essentially two arguments in support of its contention that it has not acted\n\ncontrary to law. (See ECF No. 20 at 23- 25.) First, it argues that it had the discretion to terminate\n\nthe probationary employees in the manner that it did. (See id. at 23 (\"The States fundamentally\n\nmisunderstand Defendants' discretion to terminate probationers.\").) Second, it argues that it did\n\nnot conduct a RlF. (See id. at 24-25 (\" [Tihe States ignore fundamental differences between a RlF\n\nand the termination of a probationer. The actions they challenge here are the latter, not the\n\nformer.\").) These arguments are unavailing.\n\n       Agencies are, of course, permitted to terminate probationary employees. That is not what\n\nthis case is about. Indeed, agencies are directed to \"utilize the probationary period as fully as\n\npossible to determine the fitness of the employee and shall terminate his or her services during this\n\nperiod if the employee fai ls to demonstrate fully his or her qualifications for continued\n\nemployment.\" 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 3 15.803(a). However, agencies are permitted to terminate probationary\n\nemployees under only three circumstances: ( l) due to conditions arising prior to their employment,\n\n5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.805; (2) due to unsatisfactory performance or conduct, 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.804(a); and\n\n(3) pursuant to a RIF. Neither the Court nor the parties has identified any other permissible reason\n\nto tem1inate a probationary employee. Indeed, the Government was invited at the TRO hearing to\n\nidentify any other permissible ways to terminate probationary employees, and it could not do so.\n\n       Here, the terminated probationary employees were plainly not terminated for cause. The\n\nsheer number of employees that were terminated in a matter of days belies any argument that these\n\nterminations were due to the employees' individual unsatisfactory performance or conduct. As\n\n\n\n\n                                                 33\n\n                                             JA509\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB              Document 43           Filed 03/13/25        Page 36 of 56\n\n\nPlaintiffs allege, the Government has terminated at least 24,000 probationary employees.6 (ECF\n\nNo. l , 139 (\" Defendants have not published official counts and locations of the employees they\n\nhave terminated, but based on publicly reported numbers and firsthand accounts from affected\n\nemployees, it appears that Defendants have terminated at least 24,000 probationary employees as\n\nof the date of this Complaint.\").) It is simply not conceivable that the Government could have\n\nconducted individualized assessments of the relevant employees in the relevant timeframe. (See,\n\ne.g., ECF No. 4-37, 14 (\"Practically speaking, it would take weeks or months to evaluate the job\n\nperformance of 6,-700 probationary employees.\").)\n\n        The States also provided affidavits from individuals who worked at certain Defendant\n\nAgencies, reflecting that the termination decisions were not based upon individualized assessments\n\nof the relevant employees. (ECF No. 4-36 ,, 4, 19 (former \"Deputy Director for Operations in the\n\nCenter for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight (CCIIO) within the Centers for\n\nMedicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)\" explaining that \" [t]he mass terminations of probationary\n\nemployees at CCIIO were not based on any individualized assessment of the probationary\n\nemployees. The CMS [chief human resources officer] did not review the positions for suitability,\n\nnever read a single person' s resume, never spoke with any of the terminated probationary\n\nemployees and had no personal knowledge of their individual perfom1ance.\"); ECF No. 4-37, 14\n\n(fonner \"Human Capital Officer for the Internal Revenue Service (' IRS ')\" explaining that\n\n\"Treasury did not review or consider the actual job performance or conduct of any IRS\n\nprobationary employee when issuing the termination notices. I know this because this fact was\n\ndiscussed openly in meetings. ').)\n\n\n\n6\n At the TRO hearing, the Government was unable to supply the Court with the number of probationary employees\nwho, to date, have been terminated from the relevant agencies. The Government likewise provided the Court with no\nevidence to suggest that the States' estimate was inaccurate.\n\n                                                       34\n\n                                                   JA510\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB                Document 43          Filed 03/13/25          Page 37 of 56\n\n\n        The Government offers no contrary evidence, yet it insists that these were for-cause\n\nterminations and that the notices provided to individual employees were not defective because \" [a]\n\nstatement that a probationer has been terminated because of his or her performance during the\n\nprobationary period is sufficient.\" (ECF No. 20 at 24.)\n\n        The Court does not render any conclusions regarding what precise language a termination\n\nfor cause must contain; however, the law is clear that when dismissing an employee due to\n\nunsatisfactory performance, \"[t]he employer . . . must honestly be dissatisfied with the\n\nprobationer' s conduct or performance after giving him a fair trial on the job.\" McGuffin v. Soc.\n\nSec. Admin. , 942 F.3d 1099, 1102 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (emphasis added) (citation and internal\n\nquotation marks omitted). The affidavits filed by terminated probationary employees reflect that\n\nthey received boilerplate termination notices explaining that their performance was inadequate,\n\nbut that they had all received either formal or informal positive feedback from their supervisors.\n\n(E.g. , ECF No. 33-1 (affidavit and termination letter from former U.S. Department of\n\nTransportation probationary employee); ECF No. 33-2 (affidavit and termination letter from\n\nformer U.S. Department of Health and Human Services probationary employee); ECF No. 33-5\n\n(affidavit and termination letter from former U.S. Department of the Interior probationary\n\nemployee); ECF No. 33-10 (affidavit and termination letter from former Internal Revenue Service7\n\nprobationary employee); ECF No. 33-11 (affidavit and termination letter from former Federal\n\nEmergency Management Agency 8 probationary employee); ECF No. 33-14 (affidavit and\n\ntermination letter from former Consumer Financial Protection Bureau probationary employee);\n\nECF No. 33-15 (affidavit and termination letter from former National Oceanic and Atmospheric\n\n\n7 Although the IRS is not named as a Defendant, it sits within the Department of the Treasury, which is named .\n\n\n8 Although the Federal Emergency Management Agency is not named as a Defendant, it sits within the Department\n\nof Homeland Security, which is named.\n\n                                                        35\n\n                                                    JA511\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB               Document 43          Filed 03/13/25         Page 38 of 56\n\n\n\nAdministration probationary9 employee); ECF No. 33-16 (affidavit and termination letter from\n\nformer U.S. Department of Agriculture probationary employee); ECF No. 33-17 (affidavit and\n\ntermination letter from former Environmental Protection Agency probationary employee); ECF\n\nNo. 33-18 (affidavit and termination letter from former Small Business Administration\n\nprobationary employee); ECF No. 33-19 (affidavit and termination letter from former U.S.\n\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs probationary employee).)\n\n        Further underscoring the Court's conclusion that these terminations were not based upon\n\nqualifications or performance is that many notices to employees did not even cursorily identify\n\nany issues with the individual's performance, but rather explained that their terminations were in\n\nthe public interest or due to the priorities of the current administration, or else provided no reason\n\nat all. (E.g. , ECF No. 33-3 at 7 (U.S. Agency for International Development termination letter\n\nindicating that \" I am terminating you on the basis that it is in the best interest of the U.S.\n\nGovernment\"); ECF No. 33-4 at 7 (U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development\n\ntermination letter indicating that \"this notice is to notify you of the decision to terminate your\n\nemployment ... in order to promote the efficiency of the federal service in accordance with the\n\npriorities of the Administration\"); ECF No. 33-6 at 7 (U.S. Department of Labor termination letter\n\nindicating that \" [t]he Agency finds your further employment would not be in the public interest\");\n\nECF No. 33-7 at 8 (General Services Administration termination letter indicating \" I do not\n\nconsider it in the best interest of the government to retain you in the Federal service and have\n\ndecided to terminate your appointment during your probationary period.\"); ECF No. 33-8 at 7\n\n(U.S. Department of Education termination letter indicating that \"I regrettably inform you that I\n\nam removing you from your position of [redacted] with the agency and the federal civil service\n\n\n9\n Although the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is not named as a Defendant, it sits within the U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce, which is named.\n\n                                                       36\n\n                                                   JA512\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB            Document 43         Filed 03/13/25      Page 39 of 56\n\n\neffective today, February 12, 2025.\"); ECF No. 33-9 at 7 (U.S. Department of the Treasury\n\ntermination letter stating that \"[b ]ased on [OPM] guidance and in light of current mission needs,\n\nthe Agency finds that your continued employment at the Agency is not in the public interest\");\n\nECF No. 33-12 at 7 (U.S. Department of Energy termination letter stating \"[p]er OPM instructions,\n\nDOE finds that your further employment would not be in the public interest\"); ECF No. 33-13 at\n\n8 (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation termination letter stating that \"the FDIC finds that you\n\nhave not demonstrated that your further employment at the FDIC would be in the public interest\").)\n\n       In short, the record reflects that these probationary employees were not terminated for\n\ncause. Cf Roe v. Dep 't of Defense, 947 F.3d 207, 222 (4th Cir. 2020) (holding that the Air Force\n\ndid not perform \"individualized determination[s]\" when the \"the Air Force discharge memoranda\n\ncontain identical language briefly stating that each servicemember' s HIV-positive status ' renders\n\nhim ineligible for deployment'\"). The Government's contention to the contrary borders on the\n\nfrivolous . Moreover, to the extent that the Government counsel tries to justify these terminations\n\nas for cause after the fact, such an attempt must fail , as \"the post hoc rationalizations of the agency\n\nor the parties to this litigation cannot serve as a sufficient predicate for agency action.\" Am. Textile\n\nMfrs. Inst., Inc. v. Donovan, 452 U.S. 490, 539 (1981). And, as the Government conceded at the\n\nhearing, probationary employees may only be terminated for cause (either due to qualifications\n\nand performance, or for issues arising prior to employment) or through a RIF.\n\n       The actions of the Government reflect that these terminations were RIFs. The relevant\n\nregulations provide that \"[e]ach agency shall follow this part when it releases a competing\n\nemployee from his or her competitive level by .. . separation ... , when the release is required\n\nbecause of lack of work; shortage of funds; insufficient personnel ceiling; reorganization; the\n\nexercise of reemployment rights or restoration rights; or reclassification of an employee' s position\n\n\n\n                                                  37\n\n                                               JA513\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 43        Filed 03/13/25      Page 40 of 56\n\n\n[due] to erosion of duties when such action will talce effect after an agency has formally announced\n\na reduction in force in the employee's competitive area and when the reduction in force will talce\n\neffect within 180 days.\" 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 35 1.20 l (a)(2); see also U.S. Off. of Pers. Mgmt., Worliforce\n\nReshaping Operations Handbook, 25- 26 (20 17) (explaining that \"(a] personnel action must be\n\neffected under R1F procedures when both the action to be taken and the reason for the action are\n\ncovered by the RIF regulations\"; including, under \"actions to be talcen,\" an employee' s separation;\n\nand including, under \"reason for the action,\" a \"lack of work,\" \"shortage of funds,\" \"insufficient\n\npersonnel ceiling,\" and/or ' reorganization\"). The wholesale dismissal of employees due to their\n\nstatus as probationary employees appears to be some form of reorganization, even if the\n\nGovernment does not refer to it as such.\n\n       That these terminations were RlFs is evident from the sheer number of employees fired in\n\nsuch a short timespan. Further, the Secretary of Labor for the Maryland Department of Labor\n\nreported that, in response to queries from her office, federal agencies have reported, as reasons for\n\nthe terminations, a \"permanent lack of work due to a change in Presidential administration,\" and\n\nhave also noted that the employees were \"laid off due to a reduction in force. \" (ECF No. 4-5\n\n1161-62.) On this point, the Court again observes that several employee termination notices\n\nevince that the terminations were plainly not due to any individual employee' s performance, but\n\nrather reflected a reorganization within the relevant federal agencies. For instance, a termination\n\nletter issued by the Department of the Treasury states the following: \"In its January 20, 2025,\n\nmemorandum entitled Guidance on Probationary Periods, Administrative Leave and Details,\n\nOPM advised that ' [p]robationary periods are an essential tool for agencies to assess employee\n\nperformance and manage staffing levels.' Based on that guidance and in light of current mission\n\nneeds, the Agency finds that your continued employment at the Agency is not in the public\n\n\n\n                                                 38\n\n                                             JA514\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 43         Filed 03/13/25      Page 41 of 56\n\n\ninterest.\" (ECF No. 33-9 at 7 (alterations in original).) On top of that, the tenninations came on\n\nthe heels of an Executive Order directing agency heads to conduct RIFs.\n\n        The States have not carried their burden, however, of showing a likelihood of success on\n\nthe merits with respect to three Defendant Agencies- the Department of Defense (\"Defense\"), the\n\nNational Archives and Records Administration (\"Archives\"), and OPM. With respect to these\n\nthree named agencies only the States have not provided any affidavits from, for example, fom1er\n\nemployees attesting to their terminations, or to the presence of widespread terminations of\n\nprobationary employees. (See generally ECF No. 33 (affidavits attesting to terminations at all\n\nDefendant Agencies except for Defense, Archives, and OPM).) While the Court does not rely\n\nsolely on these affidavits and termination letters in reaching its above conclusion, those records\n\nprovide an important link between the individual Defendant Agencies and the broader allegations\n\nabout the number of employees terminated and the general statements, discussed above, that these\n\nactions constituted RIFs. So, although it is a close call, at this early stage, and given that a TRO\n\nis \"an extraordinary remedy that may only be awarded upon a clear showing that the plaintiff is\n\nentitled to such relief,\" Winter, 555 U.S. at 22 (citation omitted), there is insufficient basis in the\n\nrecord for the Court to conclude that RIFs likely occurred at these three agencies. This conclusion\n\nis without prejudice to the presentation of additional evidence with respect to these three agencies.\n\n               3.      The Agencies' Actions Were Contrary to Statutory RIF Requirements\n\n       Thus, the Court turns to whether the Government followed requisite RIF procedures. If\n\nemployees are terminated as part of a RIF, there are legal requirements the agencies must follow.\n\nSee generally 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502; 5 C.F.R. Part 351. And it is undisputed- and indisputable- that\n\nthese requirements apply to probationary employees. See 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 35 1.S0l (a)-(b). One such\n\n\n\n\n                                                  39\n\n                                              JA515\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB                 Document 43            Filed 03/13/25          Page 42 of 56\n\n\n\nrequirement is that, whenever a RJF involves at least fifty employees within a competitive area, 10\n\nthe agency must provide notice to \" [t]he State or the entity designated by the State to carry out\n\nrapid response activities under [the WIOA].\" 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.803(a). That notice must include ( 1)\n\n\"[t]he number of employees to be separated from the agency by reduction in force (broken down\n\nby geographic area or other basis specified by OPM)\"; (2) \"[t]he effective date of the separations\";\n\nand (3) \" [a]ny other information specified by OPM, including information needs identified from\n\nconsultation between OPM and the Department of Labor to facilitate delivery of placement and\n\nrelated services.\" Id. \u00a7 351.803(c).\n\n        The Government did not follow the requisite notice procedures, and it does not attempt to\n\nargue that it did. Indeed, the Government's substantive arguments are aimed only at its view that\n\nit did not conduct RIFs. And the consequence of the Government's failure to follow the requisite\n\nnotice procedures is clear: if an agency fails to provide notice, an employee \"may not be released \u25a1\n\ndue to a reduction in force.\" 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d).\n\n         Because the States have shown that the Government' s actions were highly likely \"not in\n\naccordance with law,\" 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706, they are likely to prevail on the merits of their APA claims. 11\n\n\n10 Although the Court is focused on the lack of requisite notice, there is no evidence that the Government fo llowed\n\nany of the requisite RJF procedures, including defining the competitive area. But \" [a] competitive area may consist\nof all or part of an agency,\" 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.402, and g iven the sheer number of terminated employees, it is im plausible\nthat the fifty-person threshold necessary to trigger this requirement has not been met. (See, e.g. , ECF No. 4-5 1 17\n(declaration by the Maryland Secretary of Labor explaining that \"the Maryland Department of Labor has already\nreceived at least 8 13 claims by ex-federal employees for unemployment benefits\" and that it \" is also aware of public\nannouncement of significant layoffs at Maryland and D.C.-located federal agencies\"); ECF No.4-71 30 (Declaration\nby the Director of the California Employment Development Department explaining that her office has received \" 1,621\nclaims by former federal employees for unemployment benefits since February I, 2025\"); ECF No. 4-8 1 15\n(Declaration by the Deputy Director, Service Delivery of the Illinois Department of Employment Security, explaining\nthat her office has received 446 claims for unemployment insurance by forme r federal employees); ECF No. 4-13 1 4\n(\"From January 21 - February 20, [the New York Department of Labor] received 178 new unemployment claims from\nfederal employees. From February 2 1 - February 27, the most recently available data set, [that office] logged an\nadditional 372 new unemployment claims from federal employees.\").)\n           Ln any event, the Government cannot be permitted to skirt RJF notice requirements by simply not defining\nthe competitive area as required, then claim ing the preconditions for RJF notice have not been met.\n\n11 Having resolved the matter on the basis of the APA, the Court makes no findings as to the States'       likelihood of\nsuccess on their ultra vires claim.\n\n                                                          40\n\n                                                      JA516\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 43        Filed 03/13/25      Page 43 of 56\n\n\n       B.

The damages incurred by the States are difficult to ascertain, and an\n\ninjunction is necessary to mitigate the chaos caused by the Government.\n\n\n\n                                                41\n\n                                             JA517\n\f         Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB       Document 43        Filed 03/13/25      Page 44 of 56\n\n\n         The States' diversion of resources as a result of the lack of notice also constitutes an\n\nirreparable harm. See HIAS, Inc. v. Trump, 985 F.3d 309, 326 (4th Cir. 2021) (recognizing the\n\n\"diversion of resources away from . . . core missions\" as irreparable); see also District ofColumbia\n\nv. US.

Supp. 3d 1, 42 (O.O.C. 2020) (explaining that \"the forced diversion\n\nof resources\" has been \"recognized as irreparable harm in other suits\" (collecting cases).)\n\n         In addition, the notice provision contemplates providing notice sixty days before a RIF.\n\nThe information to be provided is therefore time sensitive, and the harm itself is temporal and\n\nimmediate. This likewise weighs in favor of finding that the harm is irreparable. Cf Heritage\n\nFound. v. US. Dep \u00b7, ofState, Civ. No. TJK-24-2862, 2024 WL 4607501 , at* 10 (O.O.C. Oct. 29,\n\n2024).\n\n         C.     Balance of the Equities & the Public Interest\n\n         The fmal two factors-balance of the equities and weighing the public interest-\"merge\n\nwhen the Government is the opposing party.\" Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009). The\n\nCourt is mindful that it may not collapse this inquiry with the first Winter factor. See USA Farm\n\nLab., Inc. v. Micone, No. 23-2108, 2025 WL 586339, at *4 (4th Cir. Feb. 24, 2025) (explaining\n\nthat it is \"circular reasoning\" to argue that a government \"program is against the public interest\n\nbecause it is unlawful\" and that such argument \"is nothing more than a restatement of their\n\nlikelihood of success argument\").\n\n         In cases such as this, \"the public undoubtedly has an interest in seeing its governmental\n\ninstitutions follow the law.\" Roe, 947 F.3d at 230- 31 (internal quotation marks and citation\n\nomitted). But the public interest goes beyond that. As discussed above, these mass terminations\n\nconducted without appropriate notice have placed enormous strain on the States. And the public\n\nhas a great interest in the States not unnecessarily diverting resources from other functions. (See,\n\n\n\n                                                42\n\n                                             JA518\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 43        Filed 03/13/25     Page 45 of 56\n\n\ne.g., ECF No. 4-5 ,r 27 (Declaration from the Maryland Secretary of Labor that Maryland\n\nDepartment of Labor personnel \"have been diverted from state-funded workforce development\n\nprojects, including the Employment Advancement Right Now (' EARN') program, which is a . ..\n\nworkforce development grant initiative serving over 5,000 constituents annually\"); id. ,r 26\n\n(explaining that state matters that have been affected by the diversion of resources includes\n\n\"occupational and professional licensing oversight, financial regulation, [and] state workforce\n\ndevelopment programs\"); id. ,r 58 (explaining that the diversion will also \"impede the timely\n\nprocessing of regular [unemployment claims], creating significant backlogs and delays\"); ECF No.\n\n4-8 ,r 24 (declaration from the Deputy Director, Service Delivery of the Illinois Department of\n\nEmployment Security providing that \"the diversion of personnel to handle [Unemployment\n\nCompensation for Federal Employees] claims will impede the timely processing of regular\n\nunemployment insurance claims, creating backlogs and delays\").) It is in the public interest to\n\nprovide immediate relief to the States so as to alleviate the extreme burdens placed upon them by\n\nthe Government.     The Court also recognizes that there exists an interest in a presidential\n\nadministration carrying out its priorities, which may take the form of mass terminations. However,\n\nthe Court concludes that the public's interest in governmental institutions following the law, and\n\nin reducing burdens on the States is greater. These harms to the States- and to the public-will\n\nbe further exacerbated if emergency relief is not granted.\n\n       The Government argues that a TRO would \"impose significant and unrecoverable costs on\n\nDefendants.\" (ECF No. 20 at 27.) The Court does not discount this reality. However, by the\n\nGovernment' s own admission, reinstatement of the probationary employees is the only relief that\n\nwill provide redress to the States. (See ECF No. 20 at 14 (\" [T)he States' asserted injuries could\n\nonly be conceivably redressed by (the employees'] reinstatement.''); id. at 17 (\"To prevent or stem\n\n\n\n                                                43\n\n                                             JA519\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB            Document 43        Filed 03/13/25       Page 46 of 56\n\n\nthe diversion of state assistance resources, the Court again would have to order reinstatement of\n\nthe removed probationers into their former agency jobs.\").) The Court recognizes the breadth of\n\nthe relief it will grant, but the Court cannot allow the Government to benefit from chaos of its own\n\nmaking.\n\n       For instance, in HIAS, 985 F.3d, the Fourth Circuit upheld the district court's entry of a\n\npreliminary injunction barring the Government from enforcing an Executive Order concerning\n\nrefugee resettlement that was found to be likely violative of the federal Refugee Act, 8 U.S.C.\n\n\u00a7 1522. As the Fourth Circuit explained, \" [t]he resettlement agencies face enormous burdens to\n\ncomply with the Order and Notice, as well as the likelihood of affiliates closing entirely in\n\njurisdictions that refuse consent. In contrast, under the district court's injunction, the government\n\nmust continue to implement the refugee resettlement program according to the Act's well-\n\nestablished processes refined over several decades.\" Id. at 326. So too here, the States are faced\n\nwith enormous burdens in the face of the Government's failure to provide notice, and under an\n\norder reinstating employees and enjoining the Government from further illegal action, the\n\nGovernment must simply act according to well-established law.\n\n       On balance, the Court finds that the public interest and the equities weigh in favor of\n\ngranting a TRO.\n\nVI.    SCOPE OF RELIEF\n\n       A.      TRO Purpose & Limitations\n\n       Before turning to the specific relief that will be ordered in this case, it is necessary to review\n\nfundamental principles about the nature of a TRO and the kinds of relief that are available at the\n\nTRO stage.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  44\n\n                                              JA520\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB            Document 43         Filed 03/13/25       Page 47 of 56\n\n\n       The purpose of a preliminary injunction is to preserve the status quo until there is a trial on\n\nthe merits. Univ. of Tex. v. Camenisch, 451 U.S. 390, 395 (1981). The purpose of a TRO is to\n\npreserve the status quo until the Court is able to hold a preliminary injunction hearing. Hoechst\n\nDia/oil Co. v. Nan Ya Plastics Corp., 174 F.3d 411,422 (4th Cir. 1999). Each \"aim[s] to maintain\n\nthe status quo and prevent irreparable harm while a lawsuit remains pending.\" League of Women\n\nVoters ofNC. v. North Carolina, 769 F.3d 224, 236 (4th Cir. 2014) (citation omitted).\n\n       The Government argues that an order reinstating fired workers would not be a proper\n\ninvocation of the Court's authority to \"restrain \u25a1\", but would rather be an impermissible\n\n\"mandatory injunction.\" (ECF No. 20 at 25 n.9.) The Government is mistaken. A mandatory\n\ninjunction, which is \"disfavored\" and issued in onJy the ''most extraordinary circumstances,\" is\n\none that changes the status quo. Pierce v. NC State Bd. of Elections, 97 F.4th 194,209 (4th Cir.\n\n2024). A prohibitory injunction, by contrast, is one that maintains the status quo. League of\n\nWomen Voters, 769 F.3d at 236. Critically, the \"status quo,\" for purposes of injunctive relief, \"is\n\nnot the circumstances existing at the moment the lawsuit or injunction request was actually filed,\n\nbut the last uncontested status between the parties which preceded the controversy.\" Aggarao v.\n\nMOL Ship Mgmt. Co., 675 F.3d 355, 378 (4th Cir. 2012) (citation and internal quotation marks\n\nomitted). As the Fourth Circuit has recognized, \"it is sometimes necessary to require a party who\n\nhas recently disturbed the status quo to reverse its actions, but such an injunction restores, rather\n\nthan disturbs, the status quo ante.\" League a/Women Voters, 769 F.3d at 236 (cleaned up) (quoting\n\nAggarao, 675 F.3d at 378). As the Second Circuit has explained:\n\n       The \"status quo\" in preliminary-injunction parlance is really a \"status quo ante.\"\n       See Holt v. Cont '/ Grp., Inc., 708 F.2d 87, 90 (2d Cir. 1983) (referring to\n       reinstatement of benefits as \"restoration of the status quo ante\"); accord O Centro\n       Espirita Beneficiente Uniao Do Vegetal v. Ashcroft, 389 F.3d 973, 1013 (10th Cir.\n       2004) (en bane) (per curiam) (\"requir[ing] a party who has recently disturbed the\n       status quo to reverse its actions ... restores, rather than disturbs, the status quo ante,\n\n                                                  45\n\n                                               JA521\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB                 Document 43           Filed 03/13/25          Page 48 of 56\n\n\n\n         and is thus not an exception\" to the ordinary standard for preliminary injunctions).\n         This special \"ante\" formulation of the status quo in the realm of equities shuts out\n         defendants seeking shelter under a current \"status quo\" precipitated by their\n         wrongdoing.\nN. Am. Soccer League, LLC v. US. Soccer Fed'n, Inc. , 883 F.3d 32, 37 n.5 (2d Cir. 2018).\n\n         It is in the context of the broader conceptual distinction between a prohibitory and\n\nmandatory injunction that Rule 65 's use of the word \"restraining\" must be understood. See Warner\n\nBros. Inc. v. Dae Rim Trading, Inc., 877 F.2d 1120, 1124 (2d Cir. 1989) (stating that a TRO, \"by\n\nthe very word ' restraining[,'] should issue only for the purpose of preserving the status quo and\n\npreventing irreparable harm and for just so long as is necessary to hold a hearing\"). This is not a\n\ncase in which the Court is asked, at the TRO stage, to order a defendant to take on new burdens or\n\nobligations that it had previously not shouldered. Cf, e.g., Sosa v. Lantz, 660 F. Supp. 2d 283,\n\n290 (D. Conn. 2009) (declining to issue a TRO that would have required a state prison to move an\n\ninmate to a larger cell, on the grounds that such an order \"would provide [the inmate] with\n\naffirmative relief changing the status quo\" (emphasis in original)). Instead, the Court is asked to\n\norder the Government to preserve the situation that existed before it embarked on the likely illegal\n\nmass terminations without providing requisite notice to the States. Although such an order will\n\ninevitably require the Government to take affirmative steps to comply, it nevertheless fits\n\ncomfortably within the scope of the Court's TRO authority. See 1 lA Charles Alan Wright &\n\nArthur R. Miller, Federal Practice & Procedure \u00a7 2951 (3d ed. 2024) (\" [A]lthough they are rare,\n\ntemporary restraining orders can be framed to require affirmative action on the part of the\n\n' restrained' party.\"). 12\n\n\n\n\n12 Alternatively, as discussed in more detail below, the Court has statutory authority to order appropriate preliminary\n\nrelief under the APA. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 705 .\n\n                                                         46\n\n                                                     JA522\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 43         Filed 03/13/25      Page 49 of 56\n\n\n        B.        Geographic Scope\n\n        The Court must determine the appropriate scope of any injunctive relief. This task \"is an\n\nexercise of discretion and judgment, often dependent as much on the equities of a given case as\n\nthe substance of the legal issues it presents.\" Trump v. Int '! Refugee Assistance Project, 582 U.S.\n\n571 , 579 (2017) (citations omitted). As the Fourth Circuit has explained:\n\n        District courts have broad discretion to craft remedies based on the circumstances\n        of a case, but likewise must ensure that \"a preliminary injunction is no more\n        burdensome to the defendant than necessary to provide complete relief to the\n        plaintiffs.\" Roe v. Dep 't of Def, 947 F.3d 207, 231 (4th Cir. 2020) (citations and\n        internal quotation marks omitted). A district court may issue a nationwide\n        injunction so long as the court \"mold(s] its decree to meet the exigencies of the\n        particular case.\" Id (quoting Trump v. Int '! Refugee Assistance Project, (582 U.S.\n        571, 580) (2017)). And a nationwide injunction may be appropriate when the\n        government relies on a \"categorical policy,\" and when the facts would not require\n        different relief for others similarly situated to the plaintiffs. Id. at 232- 33.\n\nHIAS, 985 F.3d at 326 (first alteration in original).\n\n        In HIAS, the Fourth Circuit upheld the district court's entry of a preliminary injunction\n\nbarring the Government from enforcing an Executive Order concerning refugee resettlement that\n\nwas found to be likely violative of the federal Refugee Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1522. 985 F.3d at 316-18.\n\nThe Court held that the district court did not abuse its discretion in enjoining the application of the\n\nexecutive order nationwide, rather than limiting the relief to the three plaintiff resettlement\n\nagencies. As the panel explained:\n\n        The refugee resettlement program by its nature impacts refugees assigned to all\n        nine resettlement agencies, which place refugees throughout the country. Enjoining\n        the Order and Notice only as to the plaintiff resettlement agencies would cause\n        inequitable treatment of refugees and undermine the very national consistency that\n        the Refugee Act is designed to protect.\nId. at 326- 27.\n\n        Much like how the program challenged in HIAS \"impacts refugees assigned to all nine\n\nresettlement agencies, which place refugees throughout the country,\" here, the challenged\n\n\n                                                  47\n\n                                              JA523\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB            Document 43        Filed 03/13/25       Page 50 of 56\n\n\nclismissals without notice apply to federa l workers spread throughout the United States. When, as\n\nis likely the case here, the Government' s policy is violative of the law across the board, it is\n\nappropriate for injunctive relief to be nationwide in scope, rather than limited to specific plaintiffs.\n\nSee Califano v.

HIAS, 985 F.3d at 326. Moreover, any attempt to disaggregate federal\n\ngovernment- wide employment policy on a state-by-state-level is bound to be unworkable, as it\n\nwould functionally create two separate, drastically different regimes with respect to probationary\n\nemployees in each affected agency. In these circumstances, a nationwide injunction- rather than\n\none tied only to these specific States- is warranted. See CASA, Inc. v. Trump, No. 25-1153, 2025\n\nWL 654902 at * 1 (4th Cir. Feb. 28, 2025) (upholding the district court's grant of a nationwide\n\npreliminary injunction when \"the facts would not require different relief for others similarly\n\nsituated\" (cleaned up) (quoting HJAS, 985 F.3d at 326-27)).\n\n\n\n\n                                                  48\n\n                                              JA524\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 43         Filed 03/13/25      Page 51 of 56\n\n\n\n       C.

May 18, 2023).\n\nFurthermore, it is well established that the Court \"may craft declaratory and injunctive relief\n\ndesigned to preclude a federal agency from acting in contravention of its statutory and regulatory\n\nauthority,\" and that it \" may require an agency to modify its current or future practices in order to\n\naccount for past violations of its statutes or regulations.\" Coal. for Gov 't Procurement v. Fed.\n\nPrison Indus., Inc. , 365 F.3d 435,460 (6th Cir. 2004) (citations omitted).\n\n       The ordinary remedy for unlawful agency actions is vacatur. See FCC v. Next Wave Pers.\n\nCommc'ns Inc., 537 U.S. 293,300 (2003) (\"The [APA] requires federal courts to set aside federal\n\nagency action that is ' not in accordance with law' ....\" (quoting 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A))); Sierra\n\nClub v.

Cir. 1998) (\"When a reviewing\n\ncourt detennines that agency regulations are unlawful, the ordinary result is that the rules are\n\nvacated- not that their application to the individual petitioners is proscribed. ' (cleaned up)).\n\nAlthough some courts have occasionally endorsed a practice of remanding an agency action to the\n\nagency for further consideration without vacatur, see Allied-Signal, Inc. v. U.S. Nuclear Reg\n\nComm 'n, 988 F.2d 146, 150-51 (D.C. Cir. 1993), the Fourth Circuit \"has never formally embraced\n\nthe Allied-Signal remand-without-vacatur approach.\" Sierra Club v.

Even assuming that remand without vacatur may be appropriate\n\nin some instances, such a remedy is warranted only when \"there is at least a serious possibility that\n\nthe [agency] will be able to substantiate its decision on remand. ' i d. (quoting Allied-Signal, 988\n\nF.2d at 150-51 (alteration in original)). Here, however, it is likely that the Government's actions\n\nwere plainly contrary to law, and there is no plausible scenario in which the Government's\n\nprocedures for terminating probationary employees could be adequately justified on remand to the\n\nagencies. In such instances, the likely final remedy is that the Government' s actions must be\n\nvacated in their entirety. See id. (holding that vacatur was required when the challenged actions\n\nwere \"legally deficient\" such that there was no realistic possibility of the actions being justified\n\nupon agency reconsideration).\n\n       Here, the Court finds that- just as vacatur would likely be the appropriate remedy at the\n\nfinal judgment stage under the AP A, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706-the proper provisional remedy under Rule\n\n65 and\u00a7 705 is a stay of the Government's efforts to terminate probationary employees en masse\n\nand without notice to the States. Cf Career Coils. & Schs. ofTex. v. U.S. Dep 't of Educ. , 98 F.4th\n\n220, 255 (5th Cir. 2024) (\"[W]e conclude that the scope of preliminary relief under Section 705\n\naligns with the scope of ultimate relief under Section 706, which is not party-restricted and allows\n\na court to 'set aside' an unlawful agency action.\"), cert. granted in part, _ S.

Supp. 3d 1, 49\n\n(D.D.C. 2020) (\"Nationwide preliminary injunctive relief guarantees that a rule shown likely to be\n\nproven unlawful does not become effective, providing complete relief to the plaintiffs while the\n\nrule's legality is finally adjudicated.\"); see generally Gomez v. Trump, 485 F. Supp. 3d 145, 202-\n\n04 (D.D.C. 2020) (explaining the relationship between vacatur under \u00a7 706 and enjoining a likely\n\nunlawful agency action under \u00a7 705).\n\n\n\n                                                 50\n\n                                             JA526\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB            Document 43        Filed 03/13/25      Page 53 of 56\n\n\n\n        Only an order staying the Government's likely unlawful RIF process can prevent the States\n\nfrom suffering irreparable injury in the form of the disruption and costs imposed by the mass\n\nterminations. Indeed, the Government admits as much. (ECF No. 20 at 14 (\" [T]he States' asserted\n\ninjuries could only be conceivably redressed by their reinstatement.\" (emphasis omitted).) Were\n\nthe Court to withhold from granting such interim relief, it would likely be impossible adequately\n\nto remedy the States' injuries at the final judgment stage, which may be many months if not years\n\naway. Given the complexity and unprecedented nature of the terminations, it would be difficult,\n\nif not impossible, to retrospectively assign a dollar amount to the burdens incurred by the States\n\nfrom the Government's likely unlawful terminations-and in any event, money damages are likely\n\ncategorically unavailable in a suit of this type, as discussed above, see supra Section III.B .\n\n        As a practical matter, a stay of the Government's terminations of probationary employees\n\nmeans that the Government must reinstate all affected employees working for the Defendant\n\nAgencies. Then, if the Government wishes to continue pursuing its RIF agenda, the Government\n\nmust start from square one, acting in compliance with federal law. Only by following the\n\nprocedures set forth in federal law can the Court ensure that the States receive the notice to which\n\nthey are statutorily entitled. The Court is not blind to the practical reality that the relief being\n\nordered today will have far-reaching impacts on the federal workforce and will require the\n\nGovernment to expend considerable resources in an effort to undo the RIFs that have been put into\n\nplace. But, as explained above, \"the scope of injunctive relief is dictated by the extent of the\n\nviolation established.\" Califano, 442 U.S. at 702. When, as is likely the case here, the Government\n\nhas engaged in an illegal scheme spanning broad swaths of the federal workforce, it is inevitable\n\nthat the remediation of that scheme will itself be a significant task.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  51\n\n                                              JA527\n\f        Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB                Document 43           Filed 03/13/25         Page 54 of 56\n\n\n         D.       Agencies Restrained\n\n         The final issue pertaining to the scope of the TRO is which specific Defendants are to be\n\nrestrained. As discussed above, there are three agencies named as Defendants in this action-\n\nnamely, Defense, OPM, and Archives- with respect to which Plaintiffs have provided insufficient\n\nevidence that RIFs have occurred. 13 It is of course axiomatic that a movant is not entitled to a\n\nTRO against a defendant when the movant has not shown that it is likely to prevail on the merits\n\nas to that defendant. Accordingly, Defense, OPM, and Archives will be excluded from the TRO.\n\nThis exclusion is without prejudice to the States' right, at the preliminary injunction stage, to\n\nproduc.e evidence showing that RIFs occurred at these agencies and to seek appropriate relief.\n\nVII.     SECURITY/BOND REQUJREMENT\n\n         Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(c), a court may issue a TRO ''only if the movant\n\ngives security in an amount that the court considers proper to pay the costs and damages sustained\n\nby any party found to have been wrongfully enjoined or restrained.\" District courts have discretion\n\nto set the required security at a nominal amount, see Hoechst Diafoil Co., 174 F.3d at 421 n.3, and\n\nthis approach has long been followed in public-interest litigation cases, Alabama ex rel. Baxley v.\n\nCorps of Eng 'rs of U.S. Army, 411 F. Supp. 1261 , 1275- 76 (N. D. Ala. 1976) (collecting cases);\n\nSouth Carolina v. United States, 329 F. Supp. 3d 214, 238 n.35 (D.S.C. 2018) (same), vacated on\n\nother grounds, 9 I 2 F.3d 720 ( 4th Cir. 2019); Nat '/ Ass 'n of Diversity Officers in Higher Educ. v.\n\nTrump, Civ. No. ABA-25-0333 , 2025 WL 573764, at *30 (D. Md. Feb. 21 , 2025); see also Wright\n\n& Miller, supra, \u00a7 2954.\n\n\n\n13\n   A related issue is the contention urged by counsel for the Go.vemment at the TRO hearing- namely, that certain\naffidavits refer to agencies that are not Defendants in this action, In particular, the Government cited to affidavits\nfrom an employee from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (\"FEMA\") and the National Oceanic and\nAtmospheric Administration (\"NOAA\"). (See ECF No. 5- 11 , 5-15 (affidavits attesting to tenninations of probationary\nemployees at FEMA and NOAA, respectively).) But FEMA and NOAA are housed within the Departments of\nHomeland Security and Commerce, respectively, which are expressly named as Defendants. (See ECF No. I at 3-4.)\n\n                                                         52\n\n                                                     JA528\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB             Document 43         Filed 03/13/25      Page 55 of 56\n\n\n          Here, the Court concludes that a nominal bond is appropriate. AJthough the risk of harm\n\nto the Government is not remote, the potential cost of an improvidently granted TRO on the federal\n\ngovernment is too complex to calculate in this expedited proceeding. And even if a dollar amount\n\ncould be put on the Government's actions, it would be prohibitive to require plaintiffs to bear up\n\nfront the total cost of the alleged governmental wrongdoing. Accordingly, the Court will require\n\neach Plaintiff State to pay a bond of $100.\n\nVIII. STAY PENDING APPEAL\n\n          The Government requests that any order issuing injunctive relief be stayed pending appeal.\n\n(ECF No. 20 at 28.) In deciding whether to issue a stay pending appeal, the Court considers:\n\n          ( 1) whether the stay applicant has made a strong showing that he is likely to succeed\n          on the merits; (2) whether the applicant will be irreparably injured absent a stay;\n          (3) whether issuance of the stay will substantially injure the other parties interested\n          in the proceeding; and (4) where the public interest lies.\n\nNken, 556 U.S. at 434 (citation omitted). These factors \"substantial[ly] overlap\" with the Winter\n\nfactors. Id.\n\n          It is generally logically inconsistent for a court to issue a TRO or preliminary injunction\n\nand then stay that order, as the findings on which those decisions are premised are almost perfect\n\nopposites. See, e.g. PFLAG, Inc. v. Trump, Civ. No. 25-337-BAH, 2025 WL 685124, at *32 (D.\n\nMd. Mar. 4, 2025) (granting a request for a preliminary injunction, then denying a request for a\n\nstay pending appeal \"(t]or all the [same] reasons\"). Here, the stay applicant (i.e., the Government)\n\nhas not made a strong showing of likelihood of success on the merits; indeed, the Court concluded\n\nthat the Government will likely lose on the merits. Accordingly, for the reasons stated above in\n\nthe discussion of the Winter factors , the Government's request for a stay pending appeal will be\n\ndenied.\n\n\n\n                                                    53\n\n                                                JA529\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB         Document 43          Filed 03/13/25   Page 56 of 56\n\n\nIX.

WELLS\n\n           Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I, Krysti J. Wells declare as follows:\n\n\n           1.      I am the Director of the Office of Human Capital Operations, Office of Mission\n\nSupport, at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) headquartered in Washington,\n\nD.C. I make this Declaration based on my own personal knowledge, on information contained in\n\nthe records of the EPA, or on information provided to me by EPA employees.\n\n           2.      I have served in this position since October 22, 2023. In my role at the EPA, I am\n\nresponsible for operational personnel management. I have the responsibility for overseeing the\n\nrecording of personnel actions, including terminations. I assist in ensuring that all personnel\n\nactions comply with federal law, including those related to probationary employees.\n\n           3.      Probationary employees in the competitive service are employees who have been\n\nemployed for less than one year. In the excepted service, the trial period may be up to two years.\n\n           4.      The probationary period is part of the hiring process, and probationary employees\n\nhave limited protections against termination. The probationary period is essentially an extended\n\n\n\n                                                JA542\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 52-1        Filed 03/17/25      Page 3 of 62\n\n\n\ntryout to determine the fitness of the employee and, according to regulation, an agency \u201cshall\n\nterminate his or her services during this period if the employee fails to demonstrate fully his or her\n\nqualifications for continued employment.\u201d\n\n       5.      On January 20, 2025, EPA received a guidance memorandum from the Office of\n\nPersonnel Management (\u201cOPM\u201d), which stated that \u201cagencies should identify all employees on\n\nprobationary periods\u201d and \u201cshould promptly determine whether those employees should be\n\nretained at the agency.\u201d\n\n       6.      EPA terminated approximately 419 probationary employees between February 14,\n\n2025 and February 21, 2025.\n\n       7.      I have been provided and have reviewed the temporary restraining order (TRO)\n\nissued in this case on March 13, 2025, requiring EPA to reinstate all Affected Probationary\n\nEmployees, as defined in paragraph 10(c) of the TRO, who were terminated on or after January\n\n20, 2025.\n\n       8.      Whether required by operation of the TRO here or another court or administrative\n\norder, reinstatement of removed employees to full duty status would impose substantial burdens\n\non EPA, cause significant confusion, and cause turmoil for the terminated employees.\n\nSpecifically, all employees offered reinstatement into full duty status would have to be onboarded\n\nagain, including going through any applicable training, filling out human resources paperwork,\n\nobtaining new security badges, re-enrolling in benefits programs and payroll, reinstituting\n\napplicable security clearance actions, receiving government furnished equipment, and other\n\nrequisite administrative actions, such as auditing personnel requests to ensure any actions that\n\nwould have otherwise been taken during their period of separation are completed.\n\n\n\n\n                                                      I2\n                                              JA543\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 52-1          Filed 03/17/25            Page 4 of 62\n\n\n\n       9.      Additionally, an appellate ruling could reverse the district court\u2019s order shortly after\n\nterminated employees have been reinstated (via administrative leave, leave without pay, or\n\notherwise) or have returned to full duty status. In short, employees could be subjected to multiple\n\nchanges in their employment status in a matter of weeks.\n\n       10.     Nonetheless, EPA has immediately begun reinstating Affected Probationary\n\nEmployees on a leave status, as permitted by the TRO. On March 16, 2025 between 5-6 P.M. ET,\n\nEPA sent emails to the personal email addresses of all the Affected Probationary Employees\n\nnotifying them that their terminations were rescinded, as required by the TRO.\n\n       11.     Most of these employees were returned in a paid administrative leave status. Some,\n\nwho were in an unpaid leave status prior to their termination (including students on leave for the\n\nschool year), were returned to a leave without pay status.\n\n       12.     EPA uses the Department of Interior\u2019s HR processing system, Federal Personnel\n\nand Payroll System (\u201cFPPS\u201d). FPPS was offline starting at 5 P.M. ET on March 15, 2025. It\n\nremained unexpectedly offline until approximately 12 P.M. ET on March 17, 2025. As a result,\n\nEPA has not yet processed all of the cancellations for the relevant termination actions in FPPS.\n\nHowever, all of the timecards were updated to change the Affected Probationary Employees\u2019\n\nstatuses and, as noted above, Affected Probationary Employees all received a notice that their\n\ntermination was rescinded on March 16, 2025.\n\n\n\n       Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true\nand correct.\n                                                               Dated: March 17, 2025\n                                                                                       Digitally signed by KRYSTI\n\n                                                              -/s/ KRYSTI WELLS Date: 2025.03.17 17:31:01\n                                                                                WELLS\n\n                                                                                       -04'00'\n\n                                                               Krysti J.

I am the Acting Chief Human Capital Officer at the United States Department of\n\nEnergy (\u201cDOE\u201d) headquartered in Washington, D.C. I make this Declaration based on my own\n\npersonal knowledge, on information contained in the records of DOE, or on information provided\n\nto me by DOE employees.\n\n           2.      I have served in this position since February 28, 2025. In my Acting role at DOE,\n\nI oversee those responsible for personnel management. I oversee those responsible for personnel\n\nenterprise and tracking and recording of personnel actions, including terminations. I assist in\n\nensuring that all personnel actions comply with federal law, including those related to probationary\n\nemployees.\n\n           3.      Probationary employees in the competitive service are generally employees who\n\nhave been employed for less than one year. In the excepted service, the trial period may be up to\n\ntwo years.\n\n\n\n                                               JA545\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 52-1         Filed 03/17/25      Page 6 of 62\n\n\n\n       4.      The probationary period is part of the hiring process, and probationary employees\n\nhave limited protections against termination. The probationary period is an extended tryout to\n\ndetermine the fitness of the employee and, according to regulation, an agency \u201cshall terminate his\n\nor her services during this period if the employee fails to demonstrate fully his or her qualifications\n\nfor continued employment.\u201d An employee\u2019s appointment is not final until they have completed\n\ntheir probationary period.\n\n       5.      On January 20, 2025, although I was not serving in this position at that time, it is\n\nmy understanding that DOE received a guidance memorandum from the Office of Personnel\n\nManagement (\u201cOPM\u201d), which stated that \u201cagencies should identify all employees on probationary\n\nperiods\u201d and \u201cshould promptly determine whether those employees should be retained at the\n\nagency.\u201d\n\n       6.      On or around February 13 and February 14, 2025, DOE terminated approximately\n\n555 probationary employees.\n\n       7.      I have been provided and have reviewed the temporary restraining order (TRO)\n\nissued in this case on March 13, 2025, requiring various Defendants including DOE to reinstate\n\nall Affected Probationary Employees, as defined in paragraph 10(c) of the TRO, who were\n\nterminated on or after January 20, 2025.\n\n       8.      Whether required by operation of the TRO here or another court or administrative\n\norder, reinstatement of removed employees to full duty status could impose burdens on DOE and\n\ncause significant confusion and turmoil for the terminated employees. Specifically, all employees\n\noffered reinstatement into full duty status are being onboarded again, including going through any\n\napplicable training, filling out human resources paperwork, obtaining new security badges, re-\n\nenrolling in benefits programs and payroll, reinstituting applicable security clearance actions,\n\n\n\n                                                      I2\n                                              JA546\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 52-1         Filed 03/17/25       Page 7 of 62\n\n\n\nreceiving government furnished equipment, and other requisite administrative actions, such as\n\nauditing personnel requests to ensure any actions that would have otherwise been taken during\n\ntheir period of separation are completed.\n\n       9.      Additionally, an appellate ruling could reverse the district court\u2019s order shortly after\n\nterminated employees have been reinstated (via administrative leave or otherwise) or have returned\n\nto full duty status. In short, employees could be subjected to multiple changes in their employment\n\nstatus in a matter of weeks.\n\n       10.     Nonetheless, DOE has immediately begun cancelling the termination actions for all\n\nof its 555 Affected Probationary Employees. By 1:00 p.m. on March 17, 2025, DOE had cancelled\n\nthe termination notices for approximately 319 of its 555 Affected Probationary Employees and\n\nplaced them in a retroactive Administrative Leave status from the date of removal. DOE completed\n\nthis process for the remaining Affected Probationary Employees by 1:35 p.m. on March 17, 2025.\n\nIf any of these 555 employees ultimately choose not to return to employment with the Department,\n\nbut instead choose to resign, their official records (eOPF) will reflect the date of resignation\n\nspecific to the date it was communicated to leadership.\n\n       11.     All Affected Probationary Employees have been placed in a retroactive\n\nAdministrative Leave status that will continue until their badging and IT access are restored, at\n\nwhich time they will be converted to an Active Duty status.\n\n       12.     DOE continues working to reinstate employees by working with Agency leadership\n\nto arrange for an orderly return to the office (onboarding) while the employees are in an\n\nadministrative leave status. Additionally, DOE is working to restore benefit entitlements for all\n\nthe employees and ensure all personnel records are corrected and accurate.\n\n\n\n\n                                                      I3\n                                              JA547\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB         Document 52-1        Filed 03/17/25     Page 8 of 62\n\n\n\n       Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true\nand correct.\n\n\n                                            Dated: March 17, 2025\n\n                                            /s/ Reesha Trznadel\n\n                                            REESHA TRZNADEL\n                                            ACTING CHIEF HUMAN CAPITAL OFFICER\n                                            US DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY\n\n\n\n\n                                                   4\n\n                                           JA548\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB            Document 52-1        Filed 03/17/25         Page 9 of 62\n\n\n\n                           IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n                              FOR THE DISTRICT OF MARYLAND\n\n\n Maryland, et al.,\n\n                                                        Case No. 1:25-cv-00748-JKB\n            Plaintiffs,\n\n            v.\n\n United States Department of Agriculture,\n\n et al.,\n\n            Defendants.\n\n\n                            DECLARATION OF JESSICA S.

I am the Chief Human Capital Officer for the U.S. Department of Commerce\n\n(Commerce) headquartered in Washington, D.C. I make this Declaration based on my own\n\npersonal knowledge, on information contained in the records of the Department of Commerce, or\n\non information provided to me by Commerce employees.\n\n           2.      I have served in this position since September 2021. In my role at Commerce, I am\n\nresponsible for personnel management. I have the responsibility for overseeing the personnel\n\nenterprise and tracking and recording of personnel actions, including terminations. I assist in\n\nensuring that all personnel actions comply with federal law, including those related to probationary\n\nemployees.\n\n           3.      Probationary employees in the competitive service are employees who have been\n\nemployed for less than one year.

The probationary period is part of the hiring process, and probationary employees\n\nhave limited protections against termination. The probationary period is essentially an extended\n\ntryout to determine the fitness of the employee and, according to regulation, an agency \u201cshall\n\nterminate his or her services during this period if the employee fails to demonstrate fully his or her\n\nqualifications for continued employment.\u201d\n\n       5.      On January 20, 2025, Commerce received a guidance memorandum from the Office\n\nof Personnel Management (\u201cOPM\u201d), which stated that \u201cagencies should identify all employees on\n\nprobationary periods\u201d and \u201cshould promptly determine whether those employees should be\n\nretained at the agency.\u201d\n\n       6.      I have been provided and have reviewed the temporary restraining order (TRO)\n\nissued in this case on March 13, 2025, requiring Commerce to reinstate all Affected Probationary\n\nEmployees, as defined in paragraph 10(c) of the TRO, who were terminated on or after January\n\n20, 2025.\n\n       7.      Between January 20, 2025, and March 3, 2025, Commerce terminated 791\n\nprobationary employees out of approximately 9,000 total probationary and trial period employees.\n\n       8.      Whether required by operation of the TRO here or another court or administrative\n\norder, reinstatement of removed employees to full duty status would impose substantial burdens\n\non Commerce, cause significant confusion, and cause turmoil for the terminated employees.\n\nSpecifically, all employees offered reinstatement into full duty status would have to be onboarded\n\nagain, including going through any applicable training, filling out human resources paperwork,\n\nobtaining new security badges, re-enrolling in benefits programs and payroll, reinstituting\n\napplicable security clearance actions, receiving government furnished equipment, and other\n\n\n\n\n                                                      2\n\n                                              JA550\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 52-1         Filed 03/17/25      Page 11 of 62\n\n\n\nrequisite administrative actions, such as auditing personnel requests to ensure any actions that\n\nwould have otherwise been taken during their period of separation are completed.\n\n       9.      Additionally, an appellate ruling could reverse the district court\u2019s order shortly after\n\nterminated employees have been reinstated (via administrative leave or otherwise) or have returned\n\nto full duty status. In short, employees could be subjected to multiple changes in their employment\n\nstatus in a matter of weeks.\n\n       10.     Nonetheless, Commerce immediately began reinstating Affected Probationary\n\nEmployees. Twenty-seven of the 791 employees had been reinstated within days of their\n\nterminations for various operational reasons. As to the remaining 764 Affected Probationary\n\nEmployees, Commerce has issued notification of their reinstatement pursuant to the TRO. By 1:00\n\npm EDT today, March 17, 2025, Commerce had notified 736 of the Affected Probationary\n\nEmployees of their reinstatement. For the remaining 28 Affected Probationary Employees, as of\n\n1:00 pm EDT today, March 17, 2025, Commerce had not yet been able to locate personal contact\n\ninformation for those Affected Probationary Employees; however, as of 4:15pm on March 17,\n\nCommerce had notified all 764 Affected Probationary Employees of their reinstatement.\n\n       11.     Commerce will maintain all Affected Probationary Employees reinstated pursuant\n\nto the TRO in administrative leave status, retroactive to the date of termination.\n\n       12.     While it was not feasible for Commerce to process all administrative actions to\n\ncomplete the reinstatements by the time of filing, Commerce is working diligently to finalize them\n\nwithin seven days; all reinstatements will nonetheless be retroactive to the date of termination.\n\n\n\n\n                                                      3\n\n                                              JA551\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB         Document 52-1        Filed 03/17/25      Page 12 of 62\n\n\n\n       Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true\nand correct.\n                                                            Dated: March 17, 2025\n                                                                                    Digitally signed by\n                                                                JESSICA             JESSICA PALATKA\n                                                            /s/ PALATKA             Date: 2025.03.17\n                                                             -                      18:40:04 -04'00'\n                                                            Jessica S.

The probationary period is essentially an extended\n\ntryout to determine the fitness of the employee and, according to regulation, an agency \u201cshall\n\nterminate his or her services during this period if the employee fails to demonstrate fully his or her\n\nqualifications for continued employment.\u201d\n\n       5.      On January 20, 2025, the DHS received a guidance memorandum from the Office\n\nof Personnel Management (\u201cOPM\u201d), which stated that \u201cagencies should identify all employees on\n\nprobationary periods\u201d and \u201cshould promptly determine whether those employees should be\n\nretained at the agency.\u201d\n\n       6.      The DHS terminated approximately 313 probationary employees between January\n\n20, 2025 and March 14, 2025.         This number excludes probationary employees who were\n\nterminated in individualized actions based on their performance or conduct, and therefore excludes\n\nindividuals who do not meet the definition of \u201cAffected Probationary Employees\u201d in paragraph\n\n10(c) of the Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) entered in this case on March 13, 2025.\n\n       7.      I have been provided and have reviewed the TRO issued in this case on March 13,\n\n2025, requiring the DHS to reinstate all Affected Probationary Employees, as defined in paragraph\n\n10(c) of the TRO, who were terminated on or after January 20, 2025.\n\n\n\n                                                      2\n\n                                              JA554\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 52-1         Filed 03/17/25      Page 15 of 62\n\n\n\n       8.      Whether required by operation of the TRO here or another court or administrative\n\norder, reinstatement of removed employees to full duty status would impose substantial burdens\n\non the DHS, cause significant confusion, and cause turmoil for the terminated employees.\n\nSpecifically, to the extent that employees are offered reinstatement into full duty status (as opposed\n\nto administrative leave), they would have to be onboarded again, including going through any\n\napplicable training, filling out human resources paperwork, obtaining new security badges,\n\nreinstituting applicable security clearance actions, receiving government furnished equipment, and\n\nother requisite administrative actions.\n\n       9.      Additionally, an appellate ruling could reverse the district court\u2019s order shortly after\n\nterminated employees have been reinstated (via administrative leave or otherwise) or have returned\n\nto full duty status. In short, employees could be subjected to multiple changes in their employment\n\nstatus in a matter of weeks.\n\n       10.     Nonetheless, the DHS has immediately begun reinstating Affected Probationary\n\nEmployees. The DHS personnel system is linked to its payroll system, and personnel actions are\n\nprocessed with each payroll cycle. Thus, complete reinstatement is a multi-stage process that\n\nrequires preparing personnel actions for processing with the next payroll cycle. By 1:00 PM on\n\nMarch 17, 2025, the DHS took steps to place Affected Probationary Employees into administrative\n\nleave and, has prepared more than 310 personnel actions for processing. Of the 313 Affected\n\nProbationary Employees, the DHS identified 1 employee who declined reinstatement, 1 employee\n\nwho is currently employed by the DHS in another Component, and another employee who was\n\nalready returning to service in order to participate in the Deferred Resignation Program. In\n\naddition to preparing personnel actions for processing, the DHS has sent notice of reinstatement\n\nto affected probationary employees. The DHS is working diligently to take all other necessary\n\n\n\n                                                      3\n\n                                              JA555\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 52-1        Filed 03/17/25     Page 16 of 62\n\n\n\nactions to reinstate medical benefits and assess premiums, process within-grade increases and other\n\nsecondary personnel actions, correct leave balances, and carry out other administrative tasks. For\n\nAffected Probationary Employees who do not want to be reinstated (e.g., probationary employees\n\nwho obtained alternative employment and do not want to come back), DHS is offering the option\n\nof voluntary resignation.\n\n       11.     Employees reinstated pursuant to the TRO have been placed into administrative\n\nleave with full pay and benefits.\n\n       12.     DHS continues working to ensure that all Affected Employees are reinstated as\n\nquickly as possible.\n\n\n\n       Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true\nand correct.\n                                                            Dated: March 17, 2025\n\n\n\n                                                                      A\n                                                             BENJAMIN Digitally signed by\n                                                                       BENJAMIN R EDWARDS\n\n                                                             R EDWARDS Date: 2025.03.17\n                                                                       18:48:48 -04'00'\n\n\n                                                            Roland Edwards\n\n\n\n\n                                                    4\n\n                                            JA556\n\f   Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB              Document 52-1        Filed 03/17/25     Page 17 of 62\n\n\n\n\n                           IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n                              FOR THE DISTRICT OF MARYLAND\n\n\n Maryland, et al.,\n\n                                                       Case No. 1:25-cv-00748-JKB\n            Plaintiffs,\n\n            V.\n\n United States Department of Agriculture,\n\n et al.,\n\n            Defendants.\n\n\n                                 DECLARATION OF ANNE BYRD\n\n           Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I, Anne Byrd, declare as follows:\n\n\n           1.

The United States Department of Transportation terminated approximately 788\n\nprobationary employees between February 14 and 24, 2025.

In order to effectuate an orderly return to the Department of Transportation, the\n\nterminated probationary employees will be placed on paid administrative leave through\n\nWednesday, March 19, 2025. The Department of Transportation will coordinate the specifics of\n\ntheir return, including the restoration of their government equipment and Personal Identity\n\nVerification (PIV) card.

Probationary employees in the competitive service are employees who have been\n\nemployed for less than one year. In the excepted service, the trial period may be up to two years.\n\n\n\n\n                                                JA564\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 52-1        Filed 03/17/25       Page 25 of 62\n\n\n\n       4.      The probationary period is part of the hiring process, and probationary employees\n\nhave limited protections against termination. The probationary period is essentially an extended\n\ntryout to determine the fitness of the employee and, according to regulation, an agency \u201cshall\n\nterminate his or her services during this period if the employee fails to demonstrate fully his or her\n\nqualifications for continued employment.\u201d\n\n       5.      On January 20, 2025, HUD received a guidance memorandum from the Office of\n\nPersonnel Management (\u201cOPM\u201d), which stated that \u201cagencies should identify all employees on\n\nprobationary periods\u201d and \u201cshould promptly determine whether those employees should be\n\nretained at the agency.\u201d\n\n       6.      HUD terminated approximately 312 probationary employees out of approximately\n\n549 probationary employees on February 14, 2025.\n\n       7.      I have been provided with and have reviewed the temporary restraining order\n\n(TRO) issued in this case on March 13, 2025, requiring HUD to reinstate all Affected Probationary\n\nEmployees, as defined in paragraph 10(c) of the TRO, who were terminated on or after January\n\n20, 2025.\n\n       8.      Whether required by operation of the TRO here or another court or administrative\n\norder, reinstatement of removed employees to full duty status would impose substantial burdens\n\non HUD, cause significant confusion, and cause turmoil for the terminated employees.\n\nSpecifically, employees offered reinstatement into full duty status will be required to obtain new\n\nsecurity badges, reinstitute applicable security clearance actions, receive government furnished\n\nequipment, and require other requisite administrative actions, such as auditing personnel requests\n\nto ensure any actions that would have otherwise been taken during their period of separation are\n\ncompleted.\n\n\n\n                                                      2\n\n                                              JA565\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 52-1         Filed 03/17/25             Page 26 of 62\n\n\n\n       9.      Additionally, an appellate ruling could reverse the district court\u2019s order shortly after\n\nterminated employees have been reinstated (via administrative leave or otherwise) or before or\n\nafter they have returned to full duty status. In short, employees could be subjected to multiple\n\nchanges in their employment status in a matter of weeks.\n\n       10.     Nonetheless, HUD has immediately begun reinstating Affected Probationary\n\nEmployees. As of this time, HUD has fully reinstated 13 employees, and by 1 pm on March 17,\n\n2025 initiated reinstatement actions for 299 probationary employees.\n\n       11.     Eleven employees were reinstated effective March 10, 2025, and two were\n\nreinstated effective March 12, 2025. Two hundred ninety-nine Affected Probationary Employees\n\nare being placed on administrative leave temporarily effective March 17, 2025.\n\n       12.     HUD has initiated the action to reinstate the 299 Affected Probationary Employees\n\nby the 1:00 p.m. deadline given by the TRO. Email notifications are being sent to the affected\n\nemployees beginning March 17, 2025, with information regarding their reinstatement.\n\n       Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true\nand correct.\n                                                              Dated: March 17, 2025\n\n\n\n                                                                           ~\n                                                                                Digitally signed by: LORI\n                                                                     LORI       MICHALSKI\n                                                                                DN: CN = LORI MICHALSKI C\n                                                                                = US O = U.S. Government OU\n                                                                     MICHALSK\n                                                              -/s/\n                                                                                = Department of Housing and\n                                                                                Urban Development\n\n                                                                     I          Date: 2025.03.17 18:25:58 -\n                                                                                04'00'\n\n\n\n\n                                                              Lori A.

GREEN\n\n           Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I, Mark D. Green, declare as follows:\n\n\n           1.      I am the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Human Capital, Learning, and Safety at the\n\nU.S. Department of the Interior (\u201cDepartment\u201d), headquartered in Washington, D.C. I have served\n\nin this position since September 2022. I make this Declaration based on my own personal\n\nknowledge, on information contained in the records of the Department, or on information provided\n\nto me by Department employees.\n\n           2.      In my role at the Department, I am responsible for personnel management. I have\n\nthe responsibility for overseeing the personnel enterprise and tracking and recording of personnel\n\nactions, including terminations. I assist in ensuring that all personnel actions comply with federal\n\nlaw, including those related to probationary and trial period appointees.\n\n           3.      Probationary appointees in the competitive service are individuals who have been\n\nworking in their respective positions for less than one year. In the excepted service, the trial period\n\nis generally two years.\n\n\n\n                                               JA567\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 52-1        Filed 03/17/25      Page 28 of 62\n\n\n\n       4.      Probationary and trial periods are part of the hiring process, and probationary and\n\ntrial period appointees have extremely limited protections against termination compared to\n\nindividuals who satisfy the definition of \u201cemployee,\u201d and accordingly enjoy greater due process\n\nprotections. Probationary and trial periods are essentially extended tryouts for finalized\n\nappointments. Supervisors evaluate probationary and trial period appointees to determine whether\n\nthe individuals would be a good fit for long-term employment. While working throughout\n\nprobationary or trial periods, individuals receive no assurance of final appointments or of\n\nbecoming permanent employees.\n\n       5.      On or about January 20, 2025, I reviewed a guidance memorandum issued by the\n\nOffice of Personnel Management (\u201cOPM\u201d), which requested that the Department and other\n\nagencies review all probationary and trial period appointees and identify which individuals should\n\nbe retained and which should be terminated. Consistent with the OPM guidance, the Department\n\nreviewed all probationary and trial period appointees\u2019 performances to determine which\n\nindividuals to keep and which to terminate. The Department continued this review process even\n\nafter OPM clarified its earlier guidance on February 14 and 24, 2025.\n\n       6.      On or after February 14, 2025, the Department retained, and did not terminate, the\n\ncompetitive service appointments of 1968 individuals during their respective probationary periods\n\nand did not terminate the excepted service appointments of 422 individuals during their respective\n\ntrial periods. However, on or after February 14, 2025, the Department did terminate the\n\ncompetitive service appointments of 1303 individuals during their respective probationary periods\n\nand did terminate the excepted service appointments of 409 individuals during their respective trial\n\nperiods, for a total of 1712 termination actions taken by the Department. Although OPM offered\n\nlanguage for potential use in developing termination notices, the Department did not adopt OPM\u2019s\n\n\n\n                                                     2\n\n                                             JA568\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB         Document 52-1        Filed 03/17/25     Page 29 of 62\n\n\n\nsuggestions, and instead, independently developed language used in the termination notices that\n\ninformed affected individuals of these personnel decisions.\n\n       7.      I have been provided and have reviewed the temporary restraining order (TRO)\n\nissued in this litigation on March 13, 2025, requiring the Department to reinstate all Affected\n\nProbationary [and Trial Period Appointees], as such individuals are defined in paragraph 10(c) of\n\nthe TRO, who were terminated on or after January 20, 2025.\n\n       8.      Whether required by operation of the TRO here or another court or administrative\n\norder, the reinstatement of all probationary and trial period appointees whom the Department\n\nterminated on or after February 14, 2025, imposes substantial burdens on the Department, causes\n\nsignificant confusion, and will potentially subject terminated individuals to the receipt of\n\nconflicting or contradictory information. Specifically, reinstating terminated appointees imposes\n\nsignificant administrative burdens on the Department. Among other things, all reinstated\n\nindividuals must be onboarded again, which includes the labor-intensive processes of coordinating\n\nhuman resources efforts and paperwork, issuing new security badges and government-furnished\n\nequipment, reinstituting applicable security clearance actions, arranging for any necessary and\n\napplicable training, re-enrolling affected individuals in benefits programs, assessing the\n\nappropriateness of granting reinstated appointees administrative leave, and calculating and\n\nprocessing the amount of any financial obligation that the Department may owe as a result of the\n\nreinstatements and the amounts, if any, that reinstated individuals request to have withheld for\n\nvarious work-related benefits. The Department must also take other requisite administrative\n\nactions, such as evaluating the off-duty actions of reinstated appointees during the period of\n\nseparation, and auditing personnel requests to ensure any actions that would have otherwise been\n\ntaken during their period of separation are completed.\n\n\n\n                                                    3\n\n                                            JA569\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 52-1        Filed 03/17/25       Page 30 of 62\n\n\n\n        9.      Additionally, reinstating terminated appointees causes confusion for the\n\nDepartment and reinstated individuals, more than four hundred forty (440) of whom have appeals\n\ncurrently pending before Administrative Judges assigned to U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board\n\n(MSPB) Regional and Field Offices. Persons who were terminated just weeks ago have now been\n\nreinstated, and the effect of these reinstatements will impact pending or potential MSPB appeals\n\nand will compel preservation, at least temporarily, of the now-rescinded termination actions. Yet,\n\nan appellate ruling could reverse the district court\u2019s order shortly after terminated individuals have\n\nbeen reinstated through extended grants of administrative leave, complete restoration to full-duty\n\nstatus, or otherwise. The Department could reverse reinstatements in that circumstance and\n\ncorrespondingly impact pending or potential or dismissed MSPB appeals. And even though the\n\nterminated individuals have now been reinstated prior to any reversal of the district court\u2019s order,\n\nthe reinstated individuals remain probationary or trial period appointees and can again be subject\n\nto termination actions, which would again inform affected individuals of their rights associated\n\nwith filing MSPB appeals, filing complaints pursuant to processes established by the U.S. Equal\n\nEmployment Opportunity Commission, and filing complaints pursuant to processes established by\n\nthe U.S. Office of Special Counsel. In short, reinstated individuals will be subjected to multiple\n\nchanges in their employment status in a matter of weeks and will be forced to untangle the maze\n\nof their potential appeal rights.\n\n        10.     The tremendous uncertainty associated with this confusion and these administrative\n\nburdens impede supervisors from appropriately managing their workforce. Work schedules and\n\nassignments are effectively being tied to hearing and briefing schedules set by the courts. It will\n\nbe extremely difficult to assign new work to reinstated individuals in light of the uncertainty over\n\ntheir future status.\n\n\n\n                                                      4\n\n                                              JA570\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 52-1        Filed 03/17/25      Page 31 of 62\n\n\n\n       11.     Finally, reinstating terminated appointees interferes with the effective functioning\n\nof the Department. On and after February 14, 2025, the Department has made meaningful changes\n\nto address the challenged terminations, including reassigning the duties performed by the\n\nterminated individuals, many of whom will have no duties to perform upon reinstatement.\n\n       12.     Nonetheless, the Department has complied with the TRO by reinstating affected\n\nprobationary period and trial period appointees. As of 1 p.m. EDT on this date, the Department\n\nhad (a) reinstated, by cancelling termination actions (a very time and labor intensive process) for,\n\napproximately forty-five percent (45%) of the 1301 individuals whose competitive service\n\nappointments the Department had terminated during their respective probationary periods and had\n\n(b) reinstated, by cancelling termination actions for, approximately twenty-five percent (25%) of\n\nthe 409 individuals whose excepted service appointments the Department had terminated during\n\ntheir respective trial periods. As of the time and date of this declaration, the Department had (c)\n\nreinstated, by cancelling termination actions for, approximately ninety-five percent (95%) of the\n\n1301 individuals whose competitive service appointments the Department had terminated during\n\ntheir respective probationary periods and had (d) reinstated, by cancelling termination actions for,\n\napproximately seventy-five percent (75%) of the 409 individuals whose excepted service\n\nappointments the Department had terminated during their respective trial periods. Accordingly, as\n\nof the time and date of this declaration, the Department had reinstated, by cancelling termination\n\nactions for, approximately ninety percent (90%) of the 1710 individuals whom the Department had\n\nterminated during their respective probationary or trial periods on or after February 14, 2025.\n\nThroughout the remainder of this date, the Department will continue the reinstatement process, by\n\ncancelling termination actions, for the remaining ten percent (10%) of the 1710 individuals whom\n\nthe Department terminated during their respective probationary or trial periods on or after February\n\n\n\n                                                     5\n\n                                             JA571\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 52-1        Filed 03/17/25    Page 32 of 62\n\n\n\n14, 2025. The Department does not intend to reinstate two (2) individuals, both of whom qualify\n\nfor exclusions from the TRO in accordance with 10(c).\n\n       13.     The Department has notified or attempted to notify, telephonically and\n\nelectronically (via personal email addresses where and when known to the Department), all\n\naffected individuals of these reinstatement actions and the cancellations of the termination\n\ndecisions, but to the extent that the Department needs to complete additional administrative\n\nprocesses related to these reinstatement/cancellation efforts, the Department continues to work\n\ndiligently to complete such processes.\n\n       14.     The Department will continue to analyze all data and information relevant to\n\ntermination actions, taken on or after February 14, 2025, that have affected or will affect\n\nindividuals during their respective probationary or trial periods.\n\n      Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true\nand correct.\n                                                              Dated: March 17, 2025\n                                                                             Digitally signed by\n                                                                             MARK GREEN\n                                                                             Date: 2025.03.17\n                                                              _____________________________/\n                                                                             18:27:03 -04'00'\n\n                                                              MARK D.

I am the Chief Human Capital Officer within the U.S. Department of Labor\n\n(.. DOL''), Office of the Assistant Secretary for Administration and Management, Office of Human\n\nResources, headquartered in Washington, D.C. I make this Declaration based on my own personal\n\nknowledge, on information contained in the records of DOL, or on information provided to me by\n\nDOL employees.\n\n           2.      I have served in this position since March 24, 2013. In my role at DOL, I am\n\nresponsible for personnel management. I have the responsibility for overseeing the human\n\nresources enterprise and tracking and recording of personnel actions, including terminations. I\n\nassist in ensuring that all personnel actions comply with Federal law, including those related to\n\nprobationary employees.\n\n           3.      Probationary employees in the competitive service are employees who have been\n\nemployed for less than one year. In the excepted service, the trial period may be up to two years.\n\n\n\n                                               JA573\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 52-1        Filed 03/17/25      Page 34 of 62\n\n\n\n       4.      The probationary period is part of the hiring and selection process, and probationary\n\nemployees have limited protections against termination. The probationary period is essentially an\n\nextended tryout to determine the fitness of the employee and, according to regulation, an agency\n\n\"shall terminate his or her services during this period if the employee fails to demonstrate fully his\n\nor her qualifications for continued employment.\"\n\n       5.      On January 20, 2025, DOL received a guidance memorandum from the Office of\n\nPersonnel Management (\"OPM\"), which stated that \"agencies should identify all employees on\n\nprobationary periods\" and \"should promptly determine whether those employees should be\n\nretained at the agency.\"\n\n       6.      I have been provided and have reviewed the temporary restraining order (\"TRO\")\n\nissued in this case on March 13, 2025, requiring DOL to reinstate all Affected Probationary\n\nEmployees, as defined in paragraph 10(c) of the TRO, who were terminated on or after January\n\n20, 2025.\n\n       7.      With respect to DOL employees who meet the definition of \"Affected Probationary\n\nEmployees\" set forth in the TRO, DOL notes that it issued probationary termination notices to\n\napproximately 170 probationary employees out of approximately 620 probationary and trial period\n\nemployees. For approximately 167 of the 170 Affected Probationary Employees, their termination\n\ndate was effective March 7, 2025; for the remaining three (3) Affected Probationary Employees,\n\ntwo had termination dates effective on February 20, 2025, and the third on February 21, 2025.\n\n       8.      Effective March 7, 2025, DOL rescinded the approximately 167 probationary\n\ntermination notices of Affected Probationary Employees whose effective termination date was\n\nMarch 7, 2025. For the remaining three (3) probationary employees whose effective termination\n\ndates were prior to March 7, 2025, DOL rescinded their terminations and reinstated their\n\n\n\n                                                      2\n                                             JA574\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB         Document 52-1       Filed 03/17/25      Page 35 of 62\n\n\n\nemployment with no loss of pay prior to March 7, 2025. Accordingly, as of this time, DOL has\n\nno Affected Probationary Employees who have not either returned to work or voluntarily separated\n\nfrom DOL.\n\n       Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true\nand correct.\n\n\n                                                           ;::::vt(kp\n                                                               0\n                                                           lg_ 0\n\n                                                           Sydney Rose\n                                                            Chief Human Capital Officer\n                                                            U.S. Department of Labor\n\n\n\n\n                                                    3\n\n                                           JA575\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB            Document 52-1       Filed 03/17/25      Page 36 of 62\n\n\n\n                          IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n                             FOR THE DISTRICT OF MARYLAND\n\n\n Maryland, et al.,\n\n                                                       Case No. 1:25-cv-00748-JKB\n            Plaintiffs,\n\n            v.\n\n United States Department of Agriculture,\n\n et al.,\n\n            Defendants.\n\n\n                             DECLARATION OF ADAM MARTINEZ\n\n           Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I, Adam Martinez declare as follows:\n\n\n           1.      I am the Acting Chief Human Capital Officer of the Consumer Financial Protection\n\nBureau (\u201cBureau\u201d) headquartered in Washington, D.C.

I have the responsibility for\n\noverseeing the personnel enterprise and tracking and recording of personnel actions, including\n\nterminations. I assist in ensuring that all personnel actions comply with federal law, including those\n\nrelated to probationary employees.\n\n           3.      Probationary employees in the competitive service are employees who have been\n\nemployed for less than one year. In the excepted service, the trial period may be up to two years.\n\n\n\n\n                                               JA576\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 52-1        Filed 03/17/25       Page 37 of 62\n\n\n\n       4.

The CFPB terminated 117 probationary employees between February 11, 2025, and\n\nFebruary 13, 2025.\n\n       7.      I have been provided and have reviewed the temporary restraining order (TRO)\n\nissued in this case on March 13, 2025, requiring the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to\n\nreinstate all Affected Probationary Employees, as defined in paragraph 10(c) of the TRO, who\n\nwere terminated on or after January 20, 2025,\n\n       8.      Whether required by operation of the TRO here or another court or administrative\n\norder, reinstatement of removed employees to full duty status will impose substantial burdens on\n\nthe CFPB, cause significant confusion, and cause turmoil for the terminated employees.\n\nSpecifically, all employees offered reinstatement into full duty status will have to be onboarded\n\nagain, including the possibility of completing any applicable training, filling out human resources\n\npaperwork, obtaining new security badges, reinstituting applicable security clearance actions,\n\nreceiving government furnished equipment, and other requisite administrative actions, such as\n\n\n\n\n                                                      2\n\n                                              JA577\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 52-1         Filed 03/17/25      Page 38 of 62\n\n\n\nauditing personnel requests to ensure any actions that would have otherwise been taken during\n\ntheir period of separation are completed.\n\n       9.      Additionally, an appellate ruling could reverse the district court\u2019s order shortly after\n\nterminated employees have been reinstated (via administrative leave or otherwise) or have returned\n\nto full duty status. In short, employees could be subjected to multiple changes in their employment\n\nstatus in a matter of weeks.\n\n       10.     Nonetheless, the CFPB has immediately begun reinstating Affected Probationary\n\nEmployees. By 3:30 pm on March 16, 2025, the CFPB reinstated 117 Affected Probationary\n\nEmployees. While CFPB has notified all Affected Probationary Employees that they have been\n\nreinstated, to the extent CFPB needs to complete additional administrative processes related to the\n\nreinstatement of these employees, CFPB is acting diligently to complete such processes.\n\n       11.     All reinstated employees will be immediately placed on administrative leave status\n\nwhile the CFPB continues to act to comply with the TRO and/or employees are to be assigned\n\nwork by management/supervisors.\n\n\n\n       Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true\nand correct.\n                                                               Dated: March 17, 2025\n                                                                              Digitally signed by\n                                                                ADAM          ADAM MARTINEZ\n\n                                                                MARTINEZ Date:      2025.03.17\n                                                               ____________________________\n                                                                              17:17:22 -04'00'\n\n\n                                                               Adam Martinez\n\n\n\n\n                                                      3\n\n                                              JA578\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB             Document 52-1        Filed 03/17/25      Page 39 of 62\n\n\n\n                           IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n                              FOR THE DISTRICT OF MARYLAND\n\n\n Maryland, et al.,\n\n                                                         Case No. 1:25-cv-00748-JKB\n            Plaintiffs,\n\n            v.\n\n United States Department of Agriculture,\n\n et al.,\n\n            Defendants.\n\n\n                          DECLARATION OF BEATRICE (JULIE) BRILL\n\n           Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I, Beatrice Julie Brill declare as follows:\n\n\n           1.

The Agency terminated 304 probationary employees out of approximately 700\n\nprobationary employees between February 11, 2025, and February 25, 2025. On February 18,\n\n2025, SBA rehired 6 of those probationary employees. As of March 17, 2025, five remain\n\nemployed with SBA and one voluntarily resigned, and thus were unaffected by the Court\u2019s recent\n\norder.\n\n         7.

By 12:40 pm on March 17, 2025, SBA had sent notification to all 298 Affected\n\nProbationary Employees that they are reinstated. Seven notifications of the 298 were\n\nundeliverable, and the OHRS Office will conduct additional outreach to obtain updated employee\n\ncontact information.\n\n       11.     127 of these employees were reinstated into administrative leave and will be\n\nprovided backpay since the date of their release. 164 employees were previously on intermittent\n\nwork schedules (non-pay status) at the time of their release and are being reinstated and returned\n\ninto intermittent non-pay status (not on administrative leave). Because these employees were on\n\nan intermittent work schedule, the Agency does not owe them any backpay.\n\n       12.     SBA continues working to reinstate all Affected Probationary Employees. Further,\n\nwhile SBA has notified Affected Probationary Employees that they have been reinstated, to the\n\nextent SBA needs to complete additional administrative processes related to the reinstatement of\n\nthese employees, SBA is acting diligently to complete such processes.\n\n\n\n\n                                                      3\n\n                                              JA581\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 52-1        Filed 03/17/25       Page 42 of 62\n        13.

I have been provided and have reviewed the temporary restraining order (TRO)\n\nissued in this case on March 13, 2025, requiring the FDIC to reinstate all Affected Probationary\n\nEmployees, as defined in paragraph 10(c) of the TRO, who were terminated on or after January\n\n20, 2025.\n\n       8.      Whether required by operation of the TRO here or another court or administrative\n\norder, reinstatement of removed employees would impose substantial burdens on the FDIC, cause\n\nsignificant confusion, and cause turmoil for the terminated employees. Specifically, employees\u2019\n\nmissed contributions to health benefits, flexible spending accounts, and thrift savings plan\n\ncontributions will have to be calculated and recovered; employees\u2019 time cards must be individually\n\nrestored, to include certifying the time lost during the termination; each employee would have to\n\n\n\n                                                      2\n\n                                             JA584\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 52-1         Filed 03/17/25      Page 45 of 62\n\n\n\npay back the lump sum payment already received for unused annual leave or set up a debt process\n\nto remit the payment back; and the FDIC security office would need to reinstate initial or bridge\n\ninvestigations for each employee.\n\n       9.      Additionally, an appellate ruling could reverse the district court\u2019s order shortly after\n\nterminated employees have been reinstated via administrative leave or have returned to full duty\n\nstatus. In short, employees could be subjected to multiple changes in their employment status in a\n\nmatter of weeks.\n\n       10.     Nonetheless, the FDIC reinstated all Affected Probationary Employees as of 11:59\n\nam today. As of this time, the FDIC has rescinded the terminations of 151 Affected Probationary\n\nEmployees.\n\n       11.     As of today, the reinstated Affected Probationary Employees have been placed into\n\npaid administrative leave status at the FDIC.\n\n\n\n\n       Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true\nand correct.\n                                                              Dated: March 17, 2025\n                                                                                     Digitally signed by\n                                                                  DANIEL             DANIEL BENDLER\n                                                                                     Date: 2025.03.17\n                                                                  BENDLER\n                                                              /s/_____________       18:07:21 -04'00'\n\n                                                              Daniel H.

I am the Senior Deputy Assistant Administrator for the Office of Human Capital\n\nand Talent Management (HCTM) at the United States Agency for International Development\n\n(USAID) headquartered in Washington, D.C. I make this Declaration based on my own personal\n\nknowledge, on information contained in USAID records, or on information provided to me by\n\nUSAID employees.\n\n           2.     I have served in this position since approximately April 2024. In my role at\n\nUSAID, I am responsible for personnel management. I have the responsibility for overseeing the\n\npersonnel enterprise and tracking and recording of personnel actions, including terminations. I\n\nassist in ensuring that all personnel actions comply with federal law, including those related to\n\nprobationary employees.\n\n           3.     Probationary employees in the competitive service are employees who have been\n\nemployed for less than one year. In the excepted service, the trial period may be up to two years.\n\n\n\n\n                                              JA586\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB         Document 52-1        Filed 03/17/25      Page 47 of 62\n\n\n\n       4.      The probationary period is part of the hiring process, and probationary employees\n\nhave limited protections against termination. The probationary period is essentially an extended\n\ntryout to determine the fitness of the employee and, according to regulation, an agency \u201cshall\n\nterminate his or her services during this period if the employee fails to demonstrate fully his or\n\nher qualifications for continued employment.\u201d\n\n       5.      On January 20, 2025, USAID received a guidance memorandum from the Office\n\nof Personnel Management (\u201cOPM\u201d), which stated that \u201cagencies should identify all employees\n\non probationary periods\u201d and \u201cshould promptly determine whether those employees should be\n\nretained at the agency.\u201d\n\n       6.      USAID terminated, at the direction of USAID leadership, 270 probationary\n\nemployees out of 295, effective March 7, 2025.\n\n       7.      I have been provided and have reviewed the temporary restraining order (TRO)\n\nissued in this case on March 13, 2025, requiring USAID to reinstate all Affected Probationary\n\nEmployees, as defined in paragraph 10(c) of the TRO, who were terminated on or after January\n\n20, 2025,\n\n       8.      Upon receiving notice of the TRO, USAID immediately began reinstating\n\nAffected Probationary Employees through the following process. A cancellation of the\n\ntermination action will be processed during Pay Period 5 with an effective date of March 7,\n\n2025. The SF-50 documenting this cancellation will be available in eOPF on or about March\n\n31, 2025. HCTM will email the SF-50 to all personal email addresses it has on file during the\n\nweek of March 31, 2025.\n\n       9.      Additionally, by 1:00 pm EDT today, March 17, 2025, USAID sent a letter via\n\nemail to all Affected Probationary Employees informing them of the above actions.\n\n\n\n\n                                            JA587\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 52-1      Filed 03/17/25      Page 48 of 62\n       10.

The probationary period is essentially an\n\n          extended tryout to determine the fitness of the employee and, according to regulation, an\n\n\n\n\n                                                JA592\n\f Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 52-1        Filed 03/17/25      Page 53 of 62\n\n\n\n   agency \"shall terminate his or her services during this period if the employee fails to\n\n   demonstrate fully his or her qualifications for continued employment.\"\n\n4. On January 20, 2025, Treasury received a guidance memorandum from the Office of\n\n   Personnel Management (\"OPM\"), which stated that \"agencies should identify all\n\n   employees on probationary periods\" and \"should promptly determine whether those\n\n   employees should be retained at the agency.\"\n\n5. Between February 19 and March 7, 2025, Treasury terminated approximately 7,605 out\n\n   of approximately 16,663 probationary employees.\n\n6. I have been provided and have reviewed the temporary restraining order (TRO) issued in\n\n   this case on March 13, 2025, requiring Treasury to reinstate all Affected Probationary\n\n   Employees, as defined in paragraph lO(c) of the TRO, who were terminated on or after\n\n   January 20, 2025.\n\n7. Whether required by operation of the TRO here or another court or administrative order,\n\n   all employees offered reinstatement into full duty status would have to be onboarded\n\n   again, including going through any applicable training, filling out human resources\n\n   paperwork, obtaining new security badges, reinstituting applicable security clearances,\n\n   receiving government furnished equipment, and other requisite administrative actions,\n\n   such as auditing personnel requests to ensure any actions that would have otherwise been\n\n   taken during their period of separation are completed.\n\n8. Additionally, an appellate ruling could reverse the district court's order shortly after\n\n   terminated employees have been reinstated (via administrative leave or otherwise) or\n\n   have returned to full duty status. In short, employees could be subjected to multiple\n\n   changes in their employment status in a matter of weeks.\n\n                                                 2\n\n\n\n                                         JA593\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB         Document 52-1       Filed 03/17/25      Page 54 of 62\n\n\n\n 9.     Nonetheless, Treasury has immediately begun reinstating Affected Probationary\n\n Employees. Specifically, I worked with my colleagues within the office of the DAS for\n\n HR over the weekend of March 15-16 to develop an implementation plan for reinstating\n\n Affected Probationary Employees. At 10:30 AM. on March 17, my office convened a\n\n meeting with the Human Resources Officers of Treasury's bureaus, and directed them to\n\n provide notice (via personal emails or other available means) to Affected Probationary\n\n Employees by 1:00 P.M. Bureaus were provided with a template notice informing\n\n employees that they were being reinstated immediately.\n\n        a.    The Bureau of Engraving and Printing provided email notice of\n\n             reinstatement to all of its 48 Affected Probationary Employees at 11 :31 AM.\n\n             on March 17, 2025.\n\n        b. The Bureau of the Fiscal Service provided email notice to 168 of its 169\n\n             Affected Probationary Employees prior to 1:00 P.M. on March 17, 2025. The\n\n             final remaining employee received notice at 1:07 PM after an invalid email\n\n             address was corrected.\n\n        c. The United States Mint experienced delays in retrieving personal email\n\n             addresses for its 8 Affected Probationary Employees, but managed to provide\n\n             email notices to all 8 persons by 1:30 P.M., March 17, 2025.\n\n        d.   Due to difficulty in compiling personal email addresses, the Internal Revenue\n\n             Service (IRS) was not able to fully comply with the 1:00 deadline. It sent\n\n             email notices to 6,387 of its 7,315 Affected Probationary Employees by 3:00\n\n             P.M. on March 17, 2025. The IRS has arranged for certified mail\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\n\n\n                                      JA594\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 52-1      Filed 03/17/25      Page 55 of 62\n\n\n\n                  notifications to be sent to all of its Affected Probationary Employees on\n\n                  March 18, 2025.\n\n               e. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) had not yet formally\n\n                  processed the terminations of its 73 Affected Probationary Employees (which\n\n                  was effective March 8), and as a result was able to formally place these\n\n                  employees in an administrative leave status on March 16. OCC also sent\n\n                  email notices to its affected employees, at 3:54 P.M. on March 17.\n\n       All Treasury bureaus are working expeditiously to complete administrative processing of\n\n       the reinstatements in their Human Resources systems, including issuance of SF-50 Notice\n\n       of Personnel Action Forms.\n\n        10.    Upon reinstatement, Treasury will place each affected employee in an\n\n       Administrative Leave status.\n\n        11.    Treasury continues working to reinstate the 7,613 employees affected by the\n\n       termination action~ taken between February 19 and March 7, 2025.\n\n       Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true\n\nand correct.\n                                                            Dated: March 17, 2025\n\n\n\n\n                                                            TREVOR NORRIS\n\n\n\n\n                                                    4\n\n\n\n                                            JA595\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB            Document 52-1       Filed 03/17/25     Page 56 of 62\n\n\n\n                          IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n                             FOR THE DISTRICT OF MARYLAND\n\n\n Maryland, et al.,\n\n                                                       Case No. 1:25-cv-00748-JKB\n            Plaintiffs,\n\n            v.\n\n United States Department of Agriculture,\n\n et al.,\n\n            Defendants.\n\n\n                          DECLARATION OF MARY PLETCHER RICE\n\n           Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I, Mary Pletcher Rice declare as follows:\n\n\n           1.      I am the Acting Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Administration within\n\nDepartmental Administration at the United States Department of Agriculture (\u201cUSDA\u201d or\n\n\u201cDepartment\u201d) headquartered in Washington, D.C. I make this Declaration based on my own\n\npersonal knowledge, on information contained in the records of USDA, or on information provided\n\nto me by USDA employees. I have served in this position since January 31, 2025, and I have been\n\nemployed at USDA since 2018.\n\n           2.      In my role at USDA, I currently oversee the Department\u2019s Office of Human\n\nResources Management and I have purview over USDA subagencies\u2019 Chief Operating Officers\n\nand Human Resources Offices.\n\n           3.      Approximately 5,714 probationary employees were terminated from USDA\n\nbeginning February 13, 2025, and concluding on or around February 17, 2025. I have been\n\nprovided, and have reviewed, the temporary restraining order (\u201cTRO\u201d) issued in the above-\n\n\n\n                                               JA596\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 52-1        Filed 03/17/25      Page 57 of 62\n\n\n\ncaptioned case on March 13, 2025, requiring USDA to reinstate all Affected Probationary\n\nEmployees, as defined in paragraph 10(c) of the TRO, who were terminated on or after January\n\n20, 2025.\n\n          4.   USDA is already reinstating the terminated probationary employees, pursuant to a\n\n45-day March 5, 2025, Stay Order issued by the Merit Systems Protection Board (\u201cMSPB\u201d), which\n\nwas requested by the Office of Special Counsel.\n\n          5.   On March 12, 2025, USDA reinstated all 5,714 Affected Probationary Employees\n\nby restoring them to the status they were in prior to their terminations and provided each with back\n\npay from the date of their respective termination. As part of a phased plan for return-to-duty, upon\n\nreturning to pay status, the Affected Probationary Employee will initially be placed on paid\n\nadministrative leave. USDA began the notification process on Friday March 14th to all Affected\n\nProbationary Employees confirming their reinstatement. USDA is diligently working on providing\n\nthis notice to all Affected Probationary Employees.\n\n          6.   A group of 1,070 seasonal Forest Service Affected Probationary Employees who\n\nwere not in pay status at the time of their terminations (due to the off-season) have been reinstated\n\nto their prior unpaid status. Additionally, there are six Affected Probationary Employees in the\n\nForeign Agricultural Service who were administratively furloughed prior to their terminations, and\n\nwho have been reinstated to their prior administrative furlough status.\n\n          7.   USDA is acting diligently to complete the administrative steps related to notifying\n\nthe Affected Probationary Employees of their reinstatement, processing the reinstatements for\n\npurposes of all relevant USDA record systems, and returning the reinstated employees to duty\n\nstatus.\n\n\n\n\n                                                      2\n\n                                             JA597\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 52-1        Filed 03/17/25       Page 58 of 62\n\n\n\n       8.      Whether required by operation of the March 5, 2025, MSPB Stay Order and/or this\n\nCourt\u2019s March 13, 2025, Temporary Restraining Order, reinstating the terminated probationary\n\nemployees is complex and places the following logistical burdens on USDA and its approximately\n\n29 subordinate Mission Areas, Agencies, and Staff Offices, including USDA\u2019s multiple human\n\nresources offices: (1) initiating the process of placing all removed probationary employees, who\n\nreceived February 2025 termination letters, into pay status, and providing backpay, from the date\n\nof the termination notice through the present, which involves several systems and applies across\n\nmultiple pay periods; (2) ascertaining whether some of the probationary employees choose to\n\nresign, due to having secured other employment or not wanting to return to duty at USDA; (3)\n\nreinstituting and ensuring operational status of secured LincPasses, office space, and equipment\n\n(including laptops in most instances) for those individuals whose mission criticality requires on-\n\nsite work; and (4) addressing, as appropriate, any identified or substantiated threats to the physical\n\nsafety of USDA\u2019s existing 111,000 person workforce and security of USDA\u2019s physical plants and\n\nassets across the nation.\n\n       Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true\nand correct.\n                                                              Dated: March 17, 2025\n\n                                                                  MARY          Digitally signed\n                                                                                by MARY RICE\n                                                              /s/ RICE          Date: 2025.03.17\n                                                                                18:20:46 -04'00'\n\n                                                              MARY PLETCHER RICE\n                                                                   -\n\n\n\n\n                                                      3\n\n                                             JA598\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB            Document 52-1        Filed 03/17/25     Page 59 of 62\n\n\n\n                           IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n                              FOR THE DISTRICT OF MARYLAND\n\n\n Maryland, et al.,\n\n                                                        Case No. 1:25-cv-00748-JKB\n            Plaintiffs,\n\n            v.\n\n United States Department of Agriculture,\n\n et al.,\n\n            Defendants.\n\n\n                            DECLARATION OF MARK ENGELBAUM\n\n           Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I, Mark Engelbaum declare as follows:\n\n\n           1.      I am the Assistant Secretary for Human Resources and Administration/Operations,\n\nSecurity, and Preparedness at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), headquartered in\n\nWashington, D.C. I make this Declaration based on my own personal knowledge, on information\n\ncontained in the records of the VA, or on information provided to me by VA employees.\n\n           2.      I have served in this position since February 13, 2025. In my role at the VA, I am\n\nresponsible for personnel management. I have the responsibility for overseeing the personnel\n\nenterprise and tracking and recording of personnel actions, including terminations. I assist in\n\nensuring that all personnel actions comply with federal law, including those related to probationary\n\nemployees.\n\n           3.      Probationary employees in the competitive service are employees who have been\n\nemployed for less than one year. In the excepted service, the trial period may be up to two years.\n\n\n\n\n                                               JA599\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 52-1        Filed 03/17/25       Page 60 of 62\n\n\n\n       4.      The probationary period is part of the hiring process, and probationary employees\n\nhave limited protections against termination. The probationary period is essentially an extended\n\ntryout to determine the fitness of the employee and, according to regulation, an agency \u201cshall\n\nterminate his or her services during this period if the employee fails to demonstrate fully his or her\n\nqualifications for continued employment.\u201d\n\n       5.      On January 20, 2025, the VA received a guidance memorandum from the Office of\n\nPersonnel Management (\u201cOPM\u201d), which stated that \u201cagencies should identify all employees on\n\nprobationary periods\u201d and \u201cshould promptly determine whether those employees should be\n\nretained at the agency.\u201d\n\n       6.      VA initially terminated approximately 1,900 probationary employees between\n\nFebruary 13, 2025, and February 24, 2025, out of approximately 46,000 probationary employees\n\non board at VA at that time. Following administrative review, 1,683 remained terminated as of\n\nMarch 17, 2025.\n\n       7.      I have been provided and have reviewed the temporary restraining order (TRO)\n\nissued in this case on March 13, 2025, requiring VA to reinstate all Affected Probationary\n\nEmployees, as defined in paragraph 10(c) of the TRO, who were terminated on or after January\n\n20, 2025.\n\n       8.      Whether required by operation of the TRO here or another court or administrative\n\norder, reinstatement of removed employees to full duty status would impose substantial burdens\n\non VA, cause significant confusion, and cause turmoil for the terminated employees. Specifically,\n\nall employees offered reinstatement into full duty status would have to be onboarded again,\n\nincluding going through any applicable training, filling out human resources paperwork, obtaining\n\nnew security badges, re-enrolling in benefits programs and payroll, reinstituting applicable security\n\n\n\n                                                      2\n\n                                             JA600\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 52-1         Filed 03/17/25      Page 61 of 62\n\n\n\nclearance actions, receiving government furnished equipment, and other requisite administrative\n\nactions, such as auditing personnel requests to ensure any actions that would have otherwise been\n\ntaken during their period of separation are completed.\n\n       9.      Additionally, an appellate ruling could reverse the district court\u2019s order shortly after\n\nterminated employees have been reinstated (via administrative leave or otherwise) or have returned\n\nto full duty status. In short, employees could be subjected to multiple changes in their employment\n\nstatus in a matter of weeks.\n\n       10.     Nonetheless, VA has immediately begun rescinding the notice of termination and\n\nreinstating the employment of the Affected Probationary Employees. While notification efforts are\n\nstill underway, the VA, by 1:00 pm EDT today, Monday, March 17, 2025, has for all intents and\n\npurposes, reinstated all Affected Probationary Employees, placing them in an initial administrative\n\nleave status with full pay and benefits, effective March 17, 2025. Affected Probationary\n\nEmployees will also receive back pay from the date of termination to the date of reinstatement.\n\n       11.     Individual personal contact information is not immediately available for every\n\nindividual employee at the Agency level. Accordingly, as of the signing of this declaration, the\n\nVA has begun sending rescission notices to those employees for whom contact information is\n\navailable as well as to the servicing Human Resources offices of all 1,683 affected Probationary\n\nEmployees. The Human Resources offices are notifying the supervisors of these employees, who\n\nhave been instructed to expeditiously notify the Affected Probationary Employees that they are\n\nreinstated and in a pay status. The Agency will follow up on a daily basis, starting on close of\n\nbusiness Monday, March 17, 2025 until it has received verification that all impacted employees\n\nhave been notified. VA has started the process to cancel the Standard Form (SF) 50s that\n\n\n\n\n                                                      3\n\n                                              JA601\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB         Document 52-1        Filed 03/17/25     Page 62 of 62\n\n\n\nterminated the employment of the Affected Probationary Employees and expects this process to\n\nbe completed no later than Tuesday, March 18, 2025.\n\n       12.     VA continues working to reinstate to all Affected Probationary Employees. VA is\n\nengaging the Affected Probationary Employees\u2019 supervisor to ensure employees receive the\n\nnotice, are aware of their employment status, and are advised to maintain contact with their\n\nsupervisor while on administrative leave. The VA is acting diligently to complete additional\n\nadministrative processes related to the reinstatement of these employees.\n\n       Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true\nand correct.\n                                                            Dated: March 17, 2025\n\n\n                                                            /s/Mark Engelbaum 7:05 p.m.\n                                                            Mark Engelbaum\n\n\n\n\n                                                    4\n\n                                            JA602\n\f           Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB        Document 52-2        Filed 03/17/25     Page 1 of 5\n\n\n\n                           IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n                              FOR THE DISTRICT OF MARYLAND\n\n\n Maryland, et al.,\n\n                                                       Case No. 1:25-cv-00748-JKB\n            Plaintiffs,\n\n            v.\n\n United States Department of Agriculture,\n\n et al.,\n\n            Defendants.\n\n\n                          DECLARATION OF JOHNATHAN J. GARDNER\n\n           Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I, Johnathan J. Gardner declare as follows:\n\n\n           1.      I am the Acting Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary for Human Capital,\n\nDepartment of Health and Human Services headquartered in Washington, D.C. I make this\n\nDeclaration based on my own personal knowledge, on information contained in the records of the\n\nUnited States Department of Health and Human Services (\u201cHHS\u201d), or on information provided to\n\nme by the Department\u2019s Human Resources Directors.\n\n           2.      I have served in this position since August 12, 2024. In my role at HHS, I am\n\nresponsible for personnel management. I have the responsibility for overseeing the personnel\n\nenterprise and tracking and recording of personnel actions, including terminations. I assist in\n\nensuring that all personnel actions comply with federal law, including those related to probationary\n\nemployees.\n\n           3.      Probationary employees in the competitive service are employees who have been\n\nemployed for less than one year. In the excepted service, the trial period may be up to two years.\n\n\n\n                                               JA603\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB               Document 52-2          Filed 03/17/25         Page 2 of 5\n\n\n\n        4.       The probationary period is part of the hiring process, and probationary employees\n\nhave limited protections against termination. The probationary period is essentially an extended\n\ntryout to determine the fitness of the employee and, according to regulation, an agency \u201cshall\n\nterminate his or her services during this period if the employee fails to demonstrate fully his or her\n\nqualifications for continued employment.\u201d\n\n        5.       On January 20, 2025, HHS received a guidance memorandum from the Office of\n\nPersonnel Management (\u201cOPM\u201d), which stated that \u201cagencies should identify all employees on\n\nprobationary periods\u201d and \u201cshould promptly determine whether those employees should be\n\nretained at the agency.\u201d\n\n        6.       Between February 14 and March 13, 2025, HHS issued termination notices to 3,248\n\nprobationary and trial period employees out of approximately 8,466 employees serving a\n\nprobationary or trial period under HHS policy.1 HHS placed 2,537 probationary and trial period\n\nemployees on administrative leave through March 14, 2025; HHS also placed 711 remaining\n\nprobationary and trial period employees within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n\n(CDC) on administrative leave with no set end date. However, between February 15 and March\n\n13, 2025, 88 of these 3,248 probationary and trial period employees were subsequently taken off\n\nadministrative leave and terminated before the end of their probationary period.\n\n        7.       I have been provided and have reviewed the temporary restraining order (TRO)\n\nissued in this case on March 13, 2025, requiring HHS to reinstate all Affected Probationary\n\nEmployees, as defined in paragraph 10(c) of the TRO, who were terminated on or after January\n\n20, 2025,\n\n\n1\n  HHS Policy requires all employees to serve a probationary or trial period. However, some of these employees\nmay be entitled to due process if they meet the definition of an employee under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7511(a)(1).\n\n\n\n                                                            2\n\n                                                  JA604\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 52-2         Filed 03/17/25       Page 3 of 5\n\n\n\n       8.      Whether required by operation of the TRO here or another court or administrative\n\norder, reinstatement of removed employees to full duty status would impose substantial burdens\n\non HHS, cause significant confusion, and cause turmoil for the terminated employees.\n\nSpecifically, all employees offered reinstatement into full duty status would have to be onboarded\n\nagain, including going through any applicable training, filling out human resources paperwork,\n\nobtaining new security badges, restoring to benefits programs and payroll, receiving government\n\nfurnished equipment, and other requisite administrative actions, such as auditing personnel\n\nrequests to ensure any actions that would have otherwise been taken during their period of\n\nseparation are completed.\n\n       9.      Additionally, an appellate ruling could reverse the district court\u2019s order shortly after\n\nterminated employees have been reinstated or have returned to full duty status. In short, employees\n\ncould be subjected to multiple changes in their employment status in a matter of weeks.\n\n       10.     Nonetheless, HHS has reinstated the Affected Probationary Employees. As of this\n\ntime, HHS has reinstated the 88 Affected Probationary Employees who were terminated before\n\nthe end of their probationary period, between February 15 and March 13, 2025, as described in\n\nparagraph 6, supra. HHS sent notification to all Affected Probationary Employees of their\n\nreinstatement by email or letter on March 17, 2025.\n\n       11.     Further, HHS has placed all reinstated probationary and trial period employees on\n\nadministrative leave. In this regard, HHS has extended the administrative leave status of the 2,855\n\nprobationary and trial period employees who were scheduled to be terminated after March 14,\n\n2025 following the completion of the previously scheduled administrative leave period, as\n\ndescribed in paragraph 6, supra. HHS notes that there is a difference between the number of\n\nAffected Probationary Employees issued termination notices and the number of Affected\n\n\n\n                                                      3\n\n                                             JA605\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 52-2       Filed 03/17/25      Page 4 of 5\n\n\n\nProbationary Employees who were reinstated or had their administrative leave status extended.\n\nSome of this difference reflects the fact that, prior to March 13, 2025, HHS granted exceptions to\n\nallow some Affected Probationary Employees to return to duty. The remainder of this difference\n\nreflects the fact that, prior to March 13, 2025, HHS made a determination that some Affected\n\nProbationary Employees met the definition of an employee under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7511(a)(1) and thus\n\nwere not probationary employees under \u00a7 7511(a)(1), and accordingly, HHS reinstated those\n\nAffected Probationary Employees prior to March 13, 2025. HHS sent notification to all Affected\n\nProbationary Employees of the extension of their administrative leave period, if applicable, by\n\nemail or letter on March 17, 2025.\n\n       12.     By 1:00 pm EDT today, Monday, March 17, 2025, HHS reinstated, or extended the\n\nadministrative leave period for all of the Affected Probationary Employees within HHS, with two\n\nsmall sets of exceptions.\n\n               a.      The first set of Affected Probationary Employees are those who were\n\n       employed at NIH. HHS reinstated or extended the administration leave period for 90% of\n\n       the NIH Affected Probationary Employees by 1:00 pm EDT today. However, during the\n\n       course of this process, NIH experienced technical issues with the relevant personnel\n\n       systems, which resulted in delays completing the reinstatement or extension process. NIH\n\n       completed reinstating or extending the administrative leave period for the remaining 10%\n\n       of Affected Probationary Employees by 1:30 p.m. EDT today.\n\n               b.      The second set of Affected Probationary Employees are those CDC\n\n       employees who were already on administrative leave as of March 13, 2025. Consistent\n\n       with paragraph 6, supra, HHS is maintaining these Affected Probationary Employees on\n\n       administrative leave, with no set end date, in compliance with the TRO.\n\n\n\n                                                    4\n\n                                            JA606\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 52-2        Filed 03/17/25           Page 5 of 5\n       13.     While HHS has notified all Affected Probationary Employees that they have been\nreinstated or that their administrative leave status has been extended as applicable, to the extent\nHHS needs to complete additional administrative processes related to the reinstatement of these\nemployees, HHS is acting diligently to complete such processes.\n       Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true\nand correct.\n                                                            Dated: March 17, 2025\n                                                             JOHNATHAN J.

B\n\n\n\n\nFrom: CHCO Council\nSent: Fri day, Febru ary 14, 2025 12:48 PM\nSubject: Follow up : CHCO Council Spec ial Sess ion\n\n\nCHCOs and Deputy CHCOs,\n\n\nThank you for your time today.\n\n\nThis message clarifies immediate next steps for probationary employees.\n\n\nOver the past several days, agencies have worked to review, clean up, and finalize their lists of\nprobationary employees they wish to keep, and wish to terminate, and begin taking action.\n\n\nWe have asked that you separate probationary employees that you have not identified as mission-\ncritical no later than end of the day Monday, 2/17. We have attached a template letter. The\nseparation date should be as soon as possible that is consistent with applicable agency policies\n(including those in CBAs).\n\n\nGuidance from the Office of Personnel Management (\" OPM\") states, \"An appointment is not final\nuntil the probationary period is over,\" and the probationary period is part of \"the hiring process for\nemployees.\" A probationer is still an applicant for a finalized appointment to a particular position as\nwell as to the Federal service. \"Until the probationary period has been completed,\" a probationer\nllil.S. \"the burden to demonstrate why it is in the public interest for the Government to finalize an\nappointment to the civil service for this particular individual.\" Thus, the probationary period is part of\nthe federal hiring process; there is currently a hiring freeze: and a probationer has no right to\ncontinued employment in the federal government.\n\n\nAn employee's performance must be measured in light of the existing needs and interests of\ngovernment. OPM has emphasized that individual employee performance measurement should be\n\"aligned with and support organizational goals\" and \"focus[] employee efforts on achieving\norganizational and group goals.\" An employee's performance must be viewed through the current\nneeds and best interest of the government, in light of the President's directive to dramatically reduce\nthe size of the federal workforce.\n\n\nThrough the exemptions process, agencies have identified the highest-performing probationers in\nmission critical areas. Regulations on probationary periods state: \"The agency shall utilize the\n\n\n                                                JA609\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB            Document 78-4          Filed 03/20/25        Page 3 of 5\n\n\nprobationary period as fully as possible to determine the fitness of the employee and shall terminate\nhis or her services during this period if the employee fails to demonstrate fully his or her qualifications\nfor continued employment.\" 5 CFR 315.803. OPM believes \"qualifications for continued\nemployment\" in the current context means that only the highest-performing probationers in mission-\ncritical areas should be retained.\n\n\nAfter actioning, please update the previous probationary employee spreadsheet you've sent us to\ninclude the information below. Please resend the updated version to tracking@opm.gov with\nAmanda Scales and Jamie Sullivan on cc by 8:00pm EST Monday. This tracker should include:\n\n   \u2022   Which probationary employees have been terminated and which you plan to keep. For those\n       you plan to keep, provide an explanation of why.\n   \u2022   For each probationary employee, indicate if they have opted into the deferred resignation\n       program or not. This can be done by cross-checking the latest submissions sent to you via\n       trackjng@opm.gov. Please also indicate whether you have signed a written deferred\n       resignation agreement with them or not.\n   \u2022   Probation end date.\n\nPlease continue providing these reports daily through at least the end of next week.\n\nWe have also attached a template Probationary tracker for your reports today.\n\n\nThank you,\nOPM\n\n\n\n\n                                                JA610\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB               Document 78-4           Filed 03/20/25        Page 4 of 5\n\n\n\n                                                [DATE], 2025\n\n      MEMORANDUM FOR [EMPLOYEE], [TITLE], [ORGANIZATION]\n\n      FROM:                       [NAME]\n                                  [TITLE]\n\n      SUBJECT:                    Notification of Termination During Probationary Period\n\n      REFERENCES:                 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7511\n                                  [5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3321(a)]\n                                  [5 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 315.803 and 804]\n                                  [5 C.F.R. \u00a7 316.304]\n                                  [INSERT AGENCY POLICY]\n\n             This is to provide notification that the Agency is removing you from your position of\n      [TITLE] and federal service during your probationary/trial period consistent with the above\n      references.\n\n             On [INSERT DATE OF APPOINTMENT], the Agency appointed you to the position\n      of [TITLE].

I am over 18 years of age and competent to give this declaration. This declaration\n\nis based on my personal knowledge, information, and belief.\n\n       2.      I am the president of the Foreign Agricultural Service Employees, Local 3976,\n\nDistrict Council 20, American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, AFL-CIO\n\n(\u201cAFSCME Local 3976\u201d). AFSCME Local 3976 is affiliated with AFSCME District Council 20.\n\nDistrict Council 20, through its constituent local unions like Local 3976, represents federal\n\ncivilian employees in agencies and departments across the federal government. I have served as\n\npresident of Local 3976 since January 2021.\n\n       3.      Before becoming the local union president, I have been employed as an\n\nInternational Trade Specialist for the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s (\u201cUSDA\u201d) Foreign\n\nAgricultural Service in the Foreign Affairs Program. The Foreign Agricultural Service (\u201cFAS\u201d)\n\nis the foreign affairs arm of the USDA. Its primary mission is to open trade in other countries\n\n\n\n\n                                             JA614\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB            Document 78-5        Filed 03/20/25    Page 3 of 16\n\n\n\nand assist farmers and producers in the United States to export their agricultural products abroad.\n\nIn other words, our agency helps farmers and producers in the U.S. grow and thrive by opening\n\nforeign markets to American agricultural products. I have been employed with the Foreign\n\nAgricultural Service for 31 years.\n\n       4.         AFSCME Local 3976 represents a bargaining unit of approximately 400 civil\n\nservants who work for the Foreign Agricultural Service in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan\n\narea. These employees include International Economists, International Trade Specialists,\n\nNutritionists, Trade Policy Analysts, International Science Advisors, Technical Assistance\n\nSpecialists, International Market Specialists, and others.\n\n       5.         AFSCME Local 3976 represents the interests of the USDA\u2019s Foreign Agricultural\n\nService nonsupervisory civil servants. Our core functions include providing support, guidance,\n\nand resources to bargaining unit employees as their officially recognized exclusive\n\nrepresentative.\n\n       6.         As the exclusive representative for the nonsupervisory Foreign Agricultural\n\nService civil servants, AFSCME Local 3976 enters into collective bargaining negotiations with\n\nthe USDA on a wide variety of terms and conditions of employment and represents bargaining\n\nunit members through the negotiated grievance process.\n\n       7.         AFSCME Local 3976 and the USDA, Foreign Agricultural Service are parties to a\n\ncollective bargaining agreement that memorializes negotiated terms and conditions of\n\nemployment, benefits, rules, a grievance procedure and other procedures of the workplace.\n\n       8.         Early on Friday, February 14, 2025, bargaining unit members who are\n\nprobationary employees began notifying the union by phone, email and text messages that the\n\nUSDA sent these employees emails containing, as an attachment or within the body of the email,\n\n\n\n\n                                               JA615\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 78-5       Filed 03/20/25      Page 4 of 16\n\n\n\na letter to each employee terminating their employment, effective February 13, 2025, at 7:00\n\np.m. eastern time. The emails to affected employees were sent to employees late at night on\n\nFebruary 13 between approximately 8:00 p.m. and approximately 2:00 a.m. on February 14. A\n\ntrue and correct copy of an exemplar of one of these notices is attached hereto as Exhibit 1.\n\n       9.      The letter to employees titled \u201cNotification of Termination During Probationary\n\nPeriod\u201d explained to the affected probationary employees that they were being removed from\n\ntheir position during the \u201cprobationary/trial period.\u201d The letter further states that the USDA finds\n\nthat \u201cbased on your performance, further employment at the Agency would be in the public\n\ninterest.\u201d The letter is signed by USDA Chief Human Capital Officer, Myrna Matherly. I have\n\nseen several employees\u2019 termination notices from our bargaining unit, and they were all identical.\n\n       10.     To date, twenty-two (22) Foreign Agricultural Service probationary employees\n\nand AFSCME Local 3976 bargaining-unit members were terminated. However, AFSCME Local\n\n3976 does not currently know the scope of the terminations of probationary employees within its\n\nbargaining unit as the USDA did not provide the union advance notice of the terminations or\n\nprovided the union with a list of all affected probationary employees. The USDA has yet to\n\nrespond to a formal information request from the Union for the list of affected probationary\n\nemployees in the local\u2019s bargaining unit.\n\n       11.     Since the termination letters were sent to affected employees, the union has been\n\nflooded with emails, texts, and phone calls from affected employees and other bargaining unit\n\nmembers who are devastated and are concerned about their livelihoods and the mission of their\n\nagency. Affected employees have contacted the union to seek information, guidance,\n\nexplanations of their rights, and legal advice.\n\n\n\n\n                                              JA616\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 78-5        Filed 03/20/25      Page 5 of 16\n\n\n\n       12.     Affected probationary employees were blindsided by the termination letter and\n\nare desperately trying to figure out how they will pay for their basic needs such as health\n\ninsurance, housing, and childcare. Some of the probationary employees who were terminated had\n\nbarely started their federal careers and are among the lowest paid USDA members in entry level\n\npositions. These bargaining unit members moved to Washington, D.C., one of the most\n\nexpensive cities in the country, to work in the public service and are now left with financial\n\nobligations that they cannot afford due to the job loss.\n\n       13.     Affected employees are devastated and stressed by the negative impact of\n\nterminations on their lives and the lives of their families. Affected employees are looking to their\n\nunion to protect them and to provide information on their benefits, such as the process to\n\ncontinue healthcare coverage or how to apply to unemployment insurance, and their legal rights.\n\nSome of this information should have been provided by the agency, but it has failed to provide\n\nclear guidance on the employee\u2019s loss of benefits and what to do next concerning their separation\n\nfrom federal service. The union has had to research information that in normal circumstances\n\nwould have been provided by the agency concerning the continuation or loss of benefits to\n\nprovide to members and has been forced to seek legal advice and resources from District Council\n\n20 and AFSCME International Union on member\u2019s legal rights.\n\n       14.     The Union continues to respond to a deluge of calls, texts, and email from\n\nbargaining unit members. Members are asking about information on continuation of health\n\nbenefits; how to obtain their personnel documents and forms that are needed to apply for\n\nunemployment insurance and other benefits; the effect of the termination for \u201cperformance\u201d on\n\ntheir eligibility for unemployment insurance or future job prospects; why they are not receiving\n\ninformation and guidance from the agency. The Union is providing almost daily updates by\n\n\n\n\n                                              JA617\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB         Document 78-5        Filed 03/20/25      Page 6 of 16\n\n\n\nemails to the entire bargaining unit about what we know and can share about potential legal\n\nactions to challenge the mass terminations and to provide any information and guidance that is\n\nrelevant to their termination or loss of benefits. The Union is also hosting town hall meetings\n\nwith the members to discuss their concerns and share information.\n\n       15.     Since the USDA terminated probationary employees, the Union has had to divert\n\nvirtually all of its time and resources to engage with the membership on this issue and address\n\ntheir concerns. Since the terminations of probationary employees at the Foreign Agricultural\n\nService, I have been spending at least 9 hours per day addressing the termination of probationary\n\nemployees and responding to and assisting affected employees and other bargaining unit\n\nmembers who are concerned about the future of their employment. I have also had to work on\n\nmy days off and on the weekends to talk to affected employees, address their concerns, and\n\ncoordinate with the local\u2019s executive board on the strategy to protect our members. The local\u2019s\n\nvice president and chief steward currently work full-time jobs for the Foreign Agricultural\n\nService. These local officers must use the Union\u2019s limited union \u201cofficial time\u201d bank to work on\n\nthis issue during the workday if their workload permits or work on these issues during their time\n\noff. They have worked several hours each day either on union official time or after hours help\n\nour affected members. This representational work for the Union is only increasing because of the\n\nchaos caused by the mass terminations for all employees in the bargaining unit. Even non-\n\nprobationary employees in the bargaining unit are now terrified of opening their emails to find\n\nthey are immediately terminated and are reaching out to the Union for assurances or guidance\n\nwhich we cannot provide given the agency\u2019s lack of transparency on employee terminations.\n\n       16.     The substantial increase in emails, phone calls, text messages, and requests for\n\ncounseling concerning the termination of probationary employees has diverted resources and\n\n\n\n\n                                            JA618\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 78-5        Filed 03/20/25      Page 7 of 16\n\n\n\ntime that the union dedicates to its mission of advocating and negotiating for improved\n\nworkplace conditions, organizing new members, representing employees, and the administrative\n\ntasks to maintain the union. For example, the entire union executive board and stewards have\n\nhad to drop their non-urgent representational work to research the impact of the terminations and\n\nto counsel employees.\n\n       17.     Affected employees are particularly worried about how the termination letter,\n\nwhich states they were terminated for \u201cperformance\u201d reasons, will impact their future job\n\nprospects. Many affected employees have told the Union that they believe that the terminations\n\nwere not based on inadequate performance because they have received excellent performance\n\nevaluations, awards, or commendations and their performance had never before been questioned.\n\nOne probationary employee who corresponded with the signatory of the termination letter,\n\nMyrna Matherly, questioned the letter\u2019s representation that their termination was based on\n\nperformance and challenged the agency manager to produce any negative performance\n\nevaluation. In this correspondence the employee asked if their good performance evaluations\n\nwere a factor in their termination. Ms. Matherly responded that they were not, and that the\n\nlanguage used in the termination letter was provided by OPM for all terminations of probationary\n\nemployees across the federal government.\n\n       18.     Affected bargaining unit members are living in fear of how they will be able to\n\nfinancially provide for their families and this is affecting their mental and physical health. None\n\nof the affected employees have received their SF-50 form that documents the termination and\n\nallows employees to seek benefits such as unemployment insurance. The USDA has told some\n\naffected employees that they must wait weeks to get the form because they were hired in the\n\n\n\n\n                                             JA619\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 78-5         Filed 03/20/25      Page 8 of 16\n\n\n\nmiddle of a pay period and must wait for the current pay period to end before processing the\n\nforms.\n\n         19.   The termination of probationary employees has affected very talented and\n\ncommitted public sector workers and veterans. The USDA could not possibly justify their\n\ntermination based on inadequate \u201cperformance.\u201d\n\n         20.   One such employee was an International Economist with the Foreign Agricultural\n\nService, hired under the prestigious and highly competitive Presidential Management Fellows\n\n(\u201cPMF\u201d) program. The PMF Program is a leadership development program that recruits and\n\ntrains future government leaders that transition to the federal service after a two-year\n\nprobationary period. This affected employee is also a veteran, having served for five years as a\n\nNavy corpsman assigned to the Marine Corps to provide medic services during two deployments\n\nin Iraq and Southeast Asia. As an International Economist for the Foreign Agricultural Service,\n\nthis employee did analytical work concerning the imposition on tariffs placed on U.S.\n\nagricultural products or work engaged in trade facilitation when U.S. agricultural products are\n\nimpeded from entering a market abroad for various reasons, including retaliatory tariffs. His role\n\nwas to facilitate the trade of U.S. agricultural products in foreign markets that benefited U.S.\n\nfarmers and agricultural product producers. On the morning of February 14, 2025, this employee\n\nreceived the probationary employee email termination notice notifying his that his termination\n\nwas effective the day prior. He was subsequently locked out of all USDA systems and lost access\n\nto his personnel documents, such as past performance evaluations and other personnel\n\ndocuments. This news was devastating to the employee, who had to immediately figure out how\n\nhe would financially provide for his family, including his young son. He thought he was\n\nprotected as a veteran, by his status as a PMF fellow, and by his outstanding performance. He\n\n\n\n\n                                             JA620\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 78-5       Filed 03/20/25      Page 9 of 16\n\n\n\nfeels betrayed by the government because he went to bat for this country as a soldier serving two\n\noverseas deployments, but the government did not go to bat for him. He stated that if the agency\n\nhad actually done an individualized review of his performance, it would have concluded that his\n\nperformance was exemplary. He is currently having trouble filing for unemployment insurance\n\nbecause he has not received the SF-8 or SF-50 forms from his employer required to file for\n\nunemployment. He must move from his apartment to find more affordable housing and is\n\nthinking of using credit or his retirement savings to cover living expenses while he searches for\n\nanother job. This affected employee is concerned with the mission of the agency to open and\n\ndevelop trade in other countries and assist farmers and producers in the Unites States to export\n\ntheir agricultural products abroad because so many smart and talented people, including other\n\nPMF fellows, who do critical work for the agency were terminated without cause. Without the\n\ndozens of employees who have been terminated that provide very specialized expertise to the\n\nmission of the agency, the Foreign Agricultural Service will have a harder time keeping up with\n\ntrade barriers, leading to missed market opportunities and unchallenged restrictions that put U.S.\n\nfarmers and exporters at a disadvantage. Fewer staff also means weaker relationships between\n\nU.S. farmers and international buyers, slowing export growth and cutting into U.S. farmer\n\nincomes.\n\n       21.     Another probationary employee was terminated with only 23 days left in her\n\nprobationary period. Prior to joining the USDA, this employee worked with small-scale farmers\n\nand policy makers for over 30 years helping to balance natural resources management with\n\neconomic and social objectives. This employee served as a technical expert to hundreds of small\n\nAmerican farms and previously worked for the USDA as a contractor for more than a decade.\n\nThis employee is highly qualified and holds a BSFS in Economics of Development from\n\n\n\n\n                                            JA621\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 78-5        Filed 03/20/25      Page 10 of 16\n\n\n\nGeorgetown University, and an MS in Agroecology from University of Florida. In this final\n\nphase of her career, she decided to rejoin the USDA as a federal employee and bring her\n\nextensive experience to the Foreign Agricultural Service. In her role as Agricultural Science\n\nAdvisor she addressed trade barriers so that U.S. farmers and product makers have access to\n\noverseas markets, and to assist if shipments were stuck at foreign ports. When terminated, she\n\nwas helping a U.S. BBQ sauce maker get an ~$250,000 shipment into the European Union; since\n\nthe EU changed in regulations in November, U.S. exporters have been unable to meet the new\n\nEU requirements. During this time, this employee was also working vigorously to prevent\n\nsignificant trade losses to American farmers resulting from impending regulations in a country\n\nthat is one of our top 10 recipients of agricultural exports. The EU has announced its intent to\n\nalter how shipments are inspected and documented, and if U.S. producers aren\u2019t prepared, the\n\ntrade losses to U.S. dairy, meats/poultry/pork, soybeans, grains, and processed vegetables sectors\n\ncould reach ~$3 billion. When fired, this employee was collaborating with the US Trade\n\nRepresentative and the U.S. Embassy (in-country), analyzing which sectors would be affected\n\nfirst, which would be affected worst, and how to navigate the situation. When this employee\n\nreceived the termination email on February 14, 2025, she immediately called her supervisor, who\n\nwas unaware of the mass terminations of probationary employees. The email stated that the\n\nemployee was being fired for performance despite having a fully successful performance review.\n\nThis employee must now take her highly specialized experience and education that has benefited\n\nU.S. farmers and the public elsewhere.\n\n       22.     The terminations at our agency have been completely haphazard, even affecting\n\nemployees who are not actually probationary. For example, one of our members, who is not a\n\nprobationary employee, notified the Union that the USDA terminated her as a probationary\n\n\n\n\n                                            JA622\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 78-5         Filed 03/20/25      Page 11 of 16\n\n\n\nemployee. This termination has negatively impacted her in many ways, including significant\n\nstress on her physical and mental health, as well as financial hardship. As a single mom, losing\n\nher sole source of income has been devastating. On Friday, February 13th at 8:47pm, she\n\nreceived an email from HR with an attached notice titled \u201cTermination during Probationary\n\nPeriod.\u201d The termination notice stated that \u201c[t]he attached notice of termination is based on your\n\nprobationary status.\u201d The letter incorrectly stated that she was still within her probationary\n\nperiod and falsely stated that her termination was based on \u201cperformance.\u201d In fact, this\n\nemployee\u2019s probationary period had ended nearly a year ago, on March 13, 2024. Moreover, in\n\nthe last two years this employee has received two cash awards for her excellent performance.\n\nAdditionally, in 2023, she received an award for \u201cexpanding U.S. agriculture exports through\n\ntrade supporting initiatives.\u201d The affected employee immediately contacted the USDA\u2019s Human\n\nResources Department (\u201cHR\u201d) and the Union about this egregious mistake. The last message she\n\nreceived from HR was: \u201cWe have reviewed the job announcement and final job offer and found\n\nthat it had been erroneously announced and you were appointed to a competitive service term\n\nappointment instead of the Schedule B, excepted service appointment, as intended. As such, you\n\nwill not be terminated as a probationary employee as required by the new Administration\n\nguidance. However, this notices you that you will be receiving a letter that your term\n\nappointment will not be extended.\u201d As of today, this employee is still unsure of her employment\n\nstatus and living under constant stress and anguish. She has had to nearly deplete her savings so\n\nshe can pay her rent 3 months in advance while she looks for another job, and she must consider\n\nleaving the DC area so she can secure employment before she run out of resources to support\n\nherself and her daughter.\n\n\n\n\n                                             JA623\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 78-5        Filed 03/20/25      Page 12 of 16\n\n\n\n       23.     Members of the USDA FAS bargaining unit pay voluntary membership dues to\n\nthe union, which is the union\u2019s overwhelming source of operational funding. The union\u2019s budget\n\nwill be negatively impacted because of the loss of dues due to the terminations of probationary\n\nemployees, and its bargaining power will be diminished because of the loss of members.\n\n       24.

ANDREW FRASSETTO\n\n 2   I, Dr. Andrew Frassetto, hereby declare as follows:\n\n 3           1.     I am a member of AGFE Local 3403, and, until February 18, 2025, I was an employee\n\n 4   of the National Science Foundation (NSF). I make this statement based on personal knowledge,\n\n 5   information, and belief and if called as a witness could and would testify competently thereto.\n\n 6          2.      I received a Ph.D. in Geosciences from the University of Arizona in 2009, with a\n\n 7   dissertation on \"Teleseismic Studies of the North American Cordillera: Evaluating the Changing\n\n 8   Structure, Composition, and Fabric after Subduction.\" I subsequently conducted two years of\n\n 9   postdoctoral research at the University of Copenhagen, and then worked for thirteen years at the\n\n10   Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology (IRIS), which became the EarthScope Consortium,\n\n11   overseeing proj ects within the NSF Geodetic Facility for the Advancement of Geoscience (GAGE)\n\n12   and NSF Seismological Facility for the Advancement of Geoscience (SAGE).\n\n13          3.      I began working at NSF on September 9, 2024, as a permanent-track Program Director\n\n14   and group lead for the Division of Earth Sciences Instrumentation and Facilities (EAR-IF) program.\n\n15          4.      The opportunity to j oin NSF and give back to the science community and the next\n\n16   generation of US-based scientists was an honor and a privilege for me. I participated in several NSF\n\n17   research proj ects as a student, and my Ph.D. work was largely supported by a NSF Graduate\n\n18   Research Fellowship. Through those experiences I was able to witness NSF's unique role in\n\n19   advancing research and education in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, and I\n\n20   strongly believe in its mission.\n\n21          5.      The EAR-IF program that I worked in provides funding for around 100 projects that\n\n22   use specialized, modern scientific instrwnentation at teaching and research institutions across the\n\n23   United States. These instruments range from laboratory microscopes to radar surface mappers to\n\n24   deployable underground sensors, and are used for projects that advance research across the earth\n\n25   sciences. These projects include identifying critical minerals in mine waste, understanding how\n\n26   grassland soils respond to wildland fires, or characterizing what the Earth's atmosphere and climate\n\n27   were like millions of years ago to provide perspective on our planet and others. The instruments\n\n28   funded by the EAR-IF program are often also made available to other scientists at the same\n\n     Declaration of Dr. Andrew Frassetto, No. 3:25-cv-01780-WHA                               l\n                                             JA631\n\f     Case 3:25-cv-0l780-WHA               Document 18-9       Filed 02/23/25       Page 3 of 39\n      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB             Document 78-6        Filed 03/20/25      Page 4 of 40\n\n\n\n 1   institution or as national open-access research faci lities to support research beyond the specific\n\n 2   projects awarded funding.\n\n 3           6.        The EAR-IF program makes and oversees more than $20 million a year of awards to\n\n 4   outside institutions, and my NSF team worked creatively to maximize the return on this investment\n\n 5   and the advancement of critical science.\n\n 6           7.        The EAR-IF program cunently has active awards to institutions in California that total\n\n 7   more than $13 million over multi-year commitments.\n\n 8           8.        On February 13, 2025, I had a progress review meeting with my supervisor, Dena\n\n 9   Smith-Nufio, the Division Director of Earth Sciences. At that meeting, I was told that my\n\n10   performance was at a very high level and given a written progress review, which included statements\n\n11   that:\n\n12                 \u2022   \"His primary roles include oversight of the EAR Instrumentation and Facilities\n13                     Program and several of the division's mid-scale community faci lities, which makes his\n\n14                     role mission critical.\"\n\n15                 \u2022   \"He has already demonstrated an outstanding ability to balance the various aspects of\n16                     his job responsibilities and is highly effective at organizing and completing all his\n\n17                     work in an accurate and timely manner.\"\n\n18                 \u2022   \"He has been an outstanding contributor to the division, directorate and the agency.\"\n19   A true and correct copy of the Progress Review I received on February 13, 2025 is attached hereto as\n\n20   Exhibit A.\n\n21           9.        Five days later, my employment was terminated \"based on your performance.\"\n\n22           10.       At 9:01 am on the morning of February 18, many of my colleagues and I received an\n\n23   email directing us to attend a meeting at 10 am, signed by Star Anderson, Acting Division\n\n24   Director/Deputy CHCO Division of Human Resource Management.\n\n25           11.       I was present for the meeting in person at the NSF headquarters in Alexandria,\n\n26   Virginia, but the meeting was in a hybrid format, with many employees joining by Zoom.\n\n27           12.       Hybrid meetings are very common at NSF, as employees work in many different\n\n28   locations. To facilitate accessibility and disability accommodations, NSF meetings held over Zoom\n\n     Declaration ofDr. Andrew Frassetto, No. 3:25-cv-01780-WHA                                    2\n                                                 JA632\n\f     Case 3:25-cv-0l780-WHA            Document 18-9        Filed 02/23/25      Page 4 of 39\n     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 78-6        Filed 03/20/25      Page 5 of 40\n\n\n\n 1   have automated closed captions and transcriptions provided by default. I have participated in many\n\n 2   hybrid meetings at NSF that incorporate those transcription tools.\n\n 3           13.    The transcript attached hereto as Exhibit Bis consistent with my recollection of the\n\n 4   February 18, 2025 meeting and the tools we regularly use to transcribe meetings. I have reviewed the\n\n 5   transcript and it accurately records what transpired at the meeting, with redactions to omit the names\n\n 6   of terminated employees.\n\n 7           14.    Five members of NSF management presented at the meeting: Micah Cheatham, Chief\n\n 8   Management Officer; Karen Marrongelle, Chief Science Officer; Sarita Marshall, Chief, Payroll and\n\n 9   Benefits Branch, Division of Human Resources; Angel Williams, General Counsel; and Wonzie\n\n10   Gardner, Chief Human Capital Officer.\n\n11           15.    All statements made by NSF management and by the employees who attended the\n\n12   meeting in person appear in the transcript in Exhibit Bas coming from \"E3410 x8539 ConfRoom.\"\n\n13           16.    During the meeting, Micah Cheatham told all the terminated employees that NSF did\n\n14   not make the decision to terminate the employment of probationary employees. Instead, he stated that\n\n15   NSF had previously chosen to retain probationary employees, but late Friday night, NSF received\n\n16   direction to terminate our employment from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Those\n\n17   statements appear from roughly 10:20:37- 10:21 :09 on the transcript in Exhibit B.\n\n18           17.    Micah Cheatham further informed us that the cause that would be listed in our\n\n19   termination letters was \"boilerplate\" that came directly from OPM. He told us NSF was only\n\n20   provided the options to terminate probationary employees based on performance or conduct and that\n\n21   terminations based on conduct would not have allowed any of us to apply for unemployment benefits.\n\n22   Those statements appear from roughly I 0:26: l 0-10:26:22 on the transcript in Exhibit B.\n\n23           18.    Micah Cheatham was also the speaker in the conference room during, but not limited\n\n24   to, the times recorded on the transcript as 10:02:27-10:04:47; 10:06:35-10:06:55; 10:08:20-\n\n25   10:09: 18; 10:22: 14-10:22:33; 10:23:02-10:23:33; and 10:31: 19-10:31:27. The statement that\n\n26   appears on the transcript at 10: 15:28 reading \"[t]his is not a decision the agency made. This is a\n\n27   direction we received, first of all,\" was made by Micah Cheatham.\n\n28\n\n     Declaration ofDr. Andrew Frassetto, No. 3:25-cv-01780-WHA                                 3\n                                             JA633\n\f     Case 3:25-cv-01780-WHA             Document 18-9       Filed 02/23/25      Page 5 of 39\n     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB             Document 78-6       Filed 03/20/25      Page 6 of 40\n\n\n\n 1          19.     The speaker in the conference room during, but not limited to, the times recorded on\n\n 2   the transcript from 10:04:56-10:06:21 and 10:09:23-10:10:23 was Sarita Marshall.\n\n 3          20.     Wonzie Gardner was the speaker in the conference room during, but not limited to, the\n\n 4   times recorded on the transcript from 10: 18:52-10:1 9:31, including for the statements reading that\n\n 5   \"we have no choice,\" that NSF was \"following what we're getting from OPM\" and that \"We are\n\n 6   following orders.\"\n\n 7          2 1.    No one at the meeting stated that my performance or the performance of any of the\n\n 8   fired probationary employees was deficient.\n\n 9          22.     Following the meeting, on February 18, I was officially terminated from my position\n\n10   and given a letter stating that the reason was \"[t]he Agency finds, based on your performance, that\n\n11   you have not demonstrated that your further employment at the Agency would be in the public\n\n12   interest.\" A true and correct copy of the letter is attached hereto as Exhibit C.\n\n13          23.     Nearly 170 of my colleagues were likewise terminated, and to the best of my\n\n14   knowledge, all terminated probationary employees were provided with the same letter.\n\n15          24.     These firings are ce1tain to have a severe negative impact on NSF's work. NSF\n\n16   employs roughly 1,500 people, of whom more than l O percent have been terminated. These staff cuts\n\n17   will be extremely damaging to all of the programs at NSF and to the projects that NSF funds. For\n\n18   example, the review of proposals submitted for awards in the EAR-IF program will be immediately\n\n19   disrupted by my termination. To the extent that the program is able to continue, the work will be\n\n20   shouldered by a much smaller team, and crucial suppo1i for scientific projects across the country will\n\n21   likely be significantly delayed.\n\n22          25.     Being terminated also severely affects my life and my family. In choosing to work for\n\n23   NSF, I was attracted to the stability and benefits provided by the position. Having a federal job with\n\n24   access to healthcare benefits meant that my wife, who is a dedicated and talented early childhood\n\n25   educator who teaches at a local pre-kindergarten, could keep working at her job. The flexible hours\n\n26   also meant that I could schedule around extracurricular activities for our 7-year-old daughter, and I\n\n27   could serve as the President of her Title 1 school's Parent-Teacher Organization.\n\n28\n\n     Declaration ofDr. Andrew Frassetto, No. 3:25-cv-01780-WHA                                 4\n                                             JA634\n\f     Case 3:25-cv-01780-WHA          Document 18-9        Filed 02/23/25      Page 6 of 39\n     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 78-6        Filed 03/20/25      Page 7 of 40\n\n\n\n 1          26.

His primary roles\n   include oversight of the EAR Instrumentation and Facilities Program and several of the\n   division\u2019s mid-scale community facilities, which makes his role mission critical. Dr.\n   Frassetto has been an outstanding program director, and he has taken the lead role in\n   overseeing this important and complicated portfolio for the division. Dr. Frassetto\n   came to NSF with a unique skill set in interdisciplinary scientific research, experience\n   in the oversight of large, complex projects and coordination of field-based logistics.\n   Since joining NSF, he has taken on projects based on his own initiative and further\n   expanded his skill set and completed trainings that have focused on NSF\u2019s new Project\n   Management and Research Infrastructure competencies. He has already demonstrated\n   an outstanding ability to balance the various aspects of his job responsibilities and is\n   highly effective at organizing and completing all his work in an accurate and timely\n   manner.\n   Dr. Frassetto also has excellent oral and written communication skills. He has\n   participated in multiple in-person and virtual engagements with the scientific\n   community to help them navigate the merit review and awards management processes.\n   These engagements have included one-on-one interactions, presentations at meetings,\n   and webinars and he always creates a favorable impression of NSF with the scientific\n   community. In addition, he has started to develop partnerships with other federal\n   agencies and has led several successful virtual meetings aimed at facilitating stronger\n   relationships with our partners. Finally, he has served on cross-division and cross-\n   directorate working groups and has been a key member of the division\u2019s\n   communications team.\n   EAR has a large and diverse portfolio of research resource support, that includes\n   everything from smaller instruments to mid-scale facilities to major research\n   infrastructure projects. Dr. Frassetto\u2019s work on this portfolio has been outstanding and\n   he has brought important experience to the role and has demonstrated highly competent\n   project management and oversight. He is a program director who has needed minimal\n   supervision and eagerly seeks special assignments at higher levels of difficulty. He has\n   been an outstanding contributor to the division, directorate and the agency.\n\n\n\n\n                                            JA637\n\fCase 3:25-cv-01780-WHA Document 18-9 Filed 02/23/25 Page 9 of 39\nCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document 78-6 Filed 03/20/25 Page 10 of 40\n\n\n\n\n                  EXHIBIT B\n\n\n\n\n                            JA638\n\f      Case 3:25-cv-01780-WHA           Document 18-9      Filed 02/23/25      Page 10 of 39\n      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 78-6      Filed 03/20/25      Page 11 of 40\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 09:58:35\n\nI haven't know.

I just wanted to state that\nIPAs aren't federal employees.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:14:58\n\nSo they're not subject to the same acVons as federal employees. They're paid through grants.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:15:05\n\nThey're not paid out of appropriated dollars in the same respect.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:15:09\n\nSo that's what I would just say with that. They're not similarly situated. They look similarly situated and I\ncan appreciate that because I'm sure we're working alongside them and I understand that. The same\nargument can be made for contractors and other things.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:15:21\n\nBut IPAs are not federal employees so they can't be probaVoners because they're not feds.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:15:28\n\nSo there was no limited discreVon.

We asked who was mission criVcal and more than half of people\nwere idenV\ufb01ed as mission criVcal and that was too many. So we looked at three things.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:23:18\n\nWhether you determine mission criVcal how long a federal service you had, understanding that a large\nnumber of probaVoners had a lot of temporary federal service that does not count towards the\nprobaVon, but nevertheless.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:23:33\n\nHonorable service in the federal government. And the third thing we looked at was how close people\nwere to the end of their probaVonary period. There's a combinaVon of those factors were used to\ndetermine.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:23:43\n\nYou just said that you were taking\n\n\n\n                10:23:43\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n[              10:23:53\n\nThe conference room is muted.

Sorry. Fulling up my calendar now.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:24:19\n\nThere is no severance with this. Because of the years of service and it's a probaVonary trial period\nterminaVon. So there is no service package with this.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:24:28\n\nYou're going to get your last paycheck on Vme. So that would be for most people next Friday. And then\ntwo pay periods from that.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:24:36\n\nYou will get your annual leave lump sum payment. So if you have credit hours.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:24:40\n\nComp Vme.

I just heard that.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:25:00\n\nThey wanted to close this session soon. I asked management to please answer the quesVons of my\ncolleagues, I think they deserve that their service and their sacri\ufb01ce. And I would also ask my colleagues\nthat as uh as bad as you feel, ask any quesVon you have to ask, but please\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:25:22\n\nBe polite. I don't \ufb01nd another word to say it.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:25:28\n\nIf you have a quesVon, you can go to the mic.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:25:35\n\nGood here? So I just want to make sure that i understand The leWer that we'll be receiving in a couple\nminutes is does it are we all gedng the same cause for terminaVon is that individual for each person? I\njust want to beWer understand\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:25:56\n\nI understand, obviously. Broader thing is that it's being directed by OPM, but the technicality in the\nleWer, what's the reason? Just as we contemplate resignaVon versus resignaVon versus the leWer.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:26:10\n\nThe cause comes from boilerplate we received from OPM. The cause says that the agency \ufb01nds based on\nyour performance that you have not demonstrated that your further employment at the agency would\nbe in the public interest.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:26:22\n\nThat is the only thing it says. The opVons were performance or conduct. If we made it for conduct, you\nwould not be able to apply for unemployment.\n\n\n\n                                                 JA659\n\f     Case 3:25-cv-01780-WHA              Document 18-9           Filed 02/23/25        Page 31 of 39\n     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB              Document 78-6           Filed 03/20/25        Page 32 of 40\n\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:26:33\n\nNo. Quickly, can you clarify the BSE situaVon? Bse rotators. They're not included in this.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:26:44\n\nOkay. Unless you were in a trial period or you would have goWen an email. So VSEEs in general are not\nincluded. Yeah, so if many of us are handling stu\ufb00 literally tens of millions of dollars that are in the next\nweek or two we have to hand o\ufb00 to and need to know\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:27:02\n\nAs we hand that o\ufb00, if part of our teams are sVll going to be here as we hand o\ufb00. I mean, literally a panel\nnext week on the point of contact.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:27:11\n\nOutside agreements, MOUs with the Paul G. Allen FoundaVon, the Kavli FoundaVon, tens of millions of\ndollars. I am the person who is the person The rest of the team are rotators.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:27:21\n\nThere's a lot of money at stake. So please, please work with your division leadership in idenVfying who,\nbut as of right now, I understand that situaVon and I think we're going to \ufb01nd that in other places as well.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:27:36\n\nSo please make sure that you're looping in your divisional leadership.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:27:41\n\nAnd I have 80 panelists who are signed up on the inside. In person, in the next three weeks. I know.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:27:50\n\nI know, I understand. And my email is going to go dead at one o'clock and they're going to say, where's\nthat guy?\n\n\n\n\n                                                  JA660\n\f      Case 3:25-cv-01780-WHA              Document 18-9           Filed 02/23/25          Page 32 of 39\n      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB              Document 78-6           Filed 03/20/25          Page 33 of 40\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:27:55\n\nAnd also they need some help on how to communicate with these people about this, right? Because I\nwon't, I won't go in, won't go and do anything crazy, but do I say to them Hey, things have changed. I\nknow in this that the division leadership should do that, but I have two hours to handle all this stu\ufb00.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:28:14\n\nI appreciate your dedicaVon, the mission. I genuinely do. Please coordinate with your supervisor.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:28:23\n\nHi, could you answer my quesVon about experts? And I'll just repeat it for the bene\ufb01t of folks who are\nonline and apparently the room was muted.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:28:32\n\nSo the quesVon is, you suggested or you said that you were taking this opportunity to terminate experts,\nwhich suggests that it was not a requirement to do so.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:28:44\n\nSo I'd like your explanaVon about the raVonale behind that. Thank you. That is correct.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:28:51\n\nThat the removal of experts was completely at the agency's discreVon.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:28:56\n\nBecause if we're asked to remove probaVoners, then we also need to remove at-will employees.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:29:03\n\nSo it's an issue of fairness in your mind. It's not just an issue of fairness but yes\n\n\n\n\n                                                 -\n                 0:29:15\n\nAll right,        , we have an online quesVon           If you'd like to ask a quesVon.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   JA661\n\f     Case 3:25-cv-01780-WHA            Document 18-9          Filed 02/23/25      Page 33 of 39\n     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB            Document 78-6          Filed 03/20/25      Page 34 of 40\n\n\n\n\n[             10:29:25\n\nYeah, what is the process? So you said health insurance ends at the end of this pay period on Saturday.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:29:39\n\nI think you went mute on the rest of your quesVon.\n\n\n\n              10:29:44\n\nI don't have any control over the muVng. So I'm going to say for the record that i have received no\nnegaVve feedback about my performance have idenV\ufb01ed no issues with my performance. For that, I'm\nsaving for the record.\n\n\n\n              10:29:59\n\nBut my quesVon is, health insurance you said, ends at the end of the week.\n\n\n\n              10:30:04\n\nYou can extend to 31 days. Is that 31 days from the end of the week? And what is the process for\napplying for the extension?\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:30:12\n\nSo the extension is automaVc and yes, it begins at the end of the week. So from Saturday, you will have a\nfree automaVc 31 day extension of health insurance coverage.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:30:21\n\nYou're welcome.\n\n\n\n              10:30:21\n\nThank you. Also, I do want to say that you'll see a lot of            in this meeVng. That's because I\nshared my link and then it got shared more widely. That's the only way most of the people in this\nmeeVng were able to join in here.\n\n\n\n\n                                               JA662\n\f     Case 3:25-cv-01780-WHA              Document 18-9          Filed 02/23/25       Page 34 of 39\n     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB              Document 78-6          Filed 03/20/25       Page 35 of 40\n\n\n\n                10:30:33\n\nI am the real\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:30:39\n\n          online, can you drop the link to the booklet for those that join late and may not have received it\nat \ufb01rst, please?\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:30:48\n\nMay I go? Yes. Can you explain why you haven't negoVated with the administraVon to eliminate the\nmore expensive rotator program so that you could protect those of us that have given up our academic\njobs These people have jobs. You could reduce our force.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:31:06\n\nBy unemploying no one. So have you negoVated that with the administraVon? Have you tried to save\nthose of us that have given up our academic by dismissing those that have not.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:31:19\n\nThere's no negoVaVon, \ufb01rst of all. And second of all, the administraVon has already announced its\nintenVon to signi\ufb01cantly reduce the workforce.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:31:27\n\nIt is only a maWer of Vme.

Just wanted to make that\nannouncement for those of you online.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:31:59\n\nAgain, with the sort of more mechanical our Vmesheets, Vme cards.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 JA663\n\f     Case 3:25-cv-01780-WHA              Document 18-9          Filed 02/23/25       Page 35 of 39\n     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB              Document 78-6          Filed 03/20/25       Page 36 of 40\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:32:04\n\nWe need to get those in by 1. Correct. As long as your supervisor knows your hours for last week.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:32:12\n\nWe will take your Vme cards. Okay.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:32:18\n\nI'm going to ask a mechanical quesVon. I'm going to ask a liWle bit of a personal one.

You look around this room, these are people who have dedicated their\nlives either to their profession Similar to ones that you menVoned or you menVoned, excellent.\nSomeone's dedicated 40 years to that Many of the people in this room have done that. They've\ndedicated their lives not only to their academic careers.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:32:56\n\nBut also decided that what they wanted to do was beWer their country. They wanted to work for their\ncountry. And this was the most impacoul way for them to do that.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:33:04\n\nSo they made some sacri\ufb01ces and they le_. And to simply be said.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:33:09\n\nIn a maWer of minutes. Your service no longer maWers regardless of what you may say.

THOMAS EVANS\n\n 2   I, Dr. Thomas Evans, hereby declare as follows:\n\n 3          1.      I am a member of AGFE Local 3403, and, until February 18, 2025, I was an employee\n\n 4   of the National Science Foundation (NSF). I make this statement based on personal knowledge,\n\n 5   information, and belief, and if called as a witness could and would testify competently thereto.\n\n 6          2.      I received a Ph.D. in Geography from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill\n\n 7   in 1998, after which I spent 26 years working in academia. I began as a post-doctoral fellow at\n\n 8   Indiana University, where I advanced through the ranks to become a full Professor with tenure. In\n\n 9   2018, I moved to the University of Arizona, where I was a Professor at the School of Geography,\n\n10   Development & Environment.\n\n11          3.      My research focus was investigating how environmental processes affect people and\n\n12   how human decision-making impacts environmental systems, including research in areas such as\n\n13   environmental decision-making, institutions, governance and natural resource management, food and\n\n14   water security and food systems governance. My work involved complex geographic data analysis,\n\n15   including GPS navigation systems, satellite imagery, and land management systems.\n\n16          4.      As a Professor, I led collaborative, multi-institutional research teams involving faculty,\n\n17   graduate students, and postdocs and served on more than 25 federal review panels, evaluating\n\n18   hundreds of proposals for NSF and other agencies.\n\n19          5.      In 2021, I took a two-year leave from my university to serve as a rotator Program\n\n20   Director at NSF through the Visiting Scientist, Engineer and Educator (VSEE) program. Rotators in\n\n21   the VSEE program are employed at NSF for a limited term before returning to their universities.\n\n22          6.      After that experience, I decided to apply for a full-time position at NSF, and was hired\n\n23   as a permanent-track Program Director at the National Science Foundation on July 30, 2023.\n\n24          7.      The transition to working at NSF was a major decision for me. I wound down my\n\n25   research lab, which required ensuring that students and post-doctoral researchers found other\n\n26   positions. I also relocated my family to Washington, D.C.\n\n27          8.      The commitment letter I received from NSF stated that my employment was subject to\n\n28   a one-year probationary period.\n\n     Declaration ofDr. Thomas Evans, No. 3:25-cv-01780-WHA                                  1\n                                            JA671\n\f     Case 3:25-cv-0l780-WHA             Document 18-8      Filed 02/23/25      Page 3 of 19\n      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 78-7       Filed 03/20/25     Page 4 of 20\n\n\n\n 1           9.      The Standard Form 50 (SF 50) Notification of Personnel Action form I received at the\n\n 2   beginning of my employment listed my tenure status as \"Conditional,'' which I understood at the time\n\n 3   to mean that I was a probationary employee.\n\n 4           10.     I completed my one-year probationary period on July 30, 2024.\n\n 5           11.     On July 30, 2024, a subsequent SF-50 was issued to my electronic official personnel\n\n 6   folder (eOPF) reflecting the change in my status from \"Conditional\" to \"Permanent\" in box 24\n\n 7   (\"Tenure\") of the form. I therefore understood that I was no longer a probationary employee and that\n\n 8   I had fu ll civil service protections in my job.\n\n 9           12.     On or about February 5, 2025, I became aware that my name was included on a list of\n\n10   probationary employees that had been sent by NSF to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). I\n\n11   reached out to NSF human resources to try to understand why that was the case. Human resources\n\n12   then informed me for the first time that I was considered a probationary employee for two years,\n\n13   despite the documentation I had previously received. No NSF-wide was sent announcing this change\n\n14   to all employees or even to aU employees who had likewise been given offer letters stating that they\n\n15   were probationary for only one year.\n\n16           13.     As of February 18, 2025, no SF-50 had been uploaded to my eOPF indicating any\n\n17   change in my tenure status from \"Permanent.\"\n\n18           14.     Throughout my total service of 3 years and 6 months at NSF between my term as a\n\n19   rotator and permanent employment, I consistently received performance evaluations of\n\n20   \"Outstanding.\" Attached hereto as Exhibit A is a true and correct copy of my performance evaluation\n\n21   conducted in April 2024, in which I was rated Outstanding, the highest of five possible levels, in all\n\n22   three performance elements for my position: Program Planning and Management, Programmatic and\n\n23   Scientific Communication, Professional Development. The names of other NSF employees have been\n\n24   redacted.\n\n25           15.     In the narrative sections of my April 2024 performance review, my supervisor wrote\n\n26   that:\n\n27       \u2022   \"Tom completes the basic responsibilities of program management, recruiting panelists and\n\n28           ad-hoc reviewers, managing review panels, program budgeting, processing proposals, and\n\n     Declaration ofDr. Thomas Evans, No. 3:25-cv-01780-WHA                                  2\n                                              JA672\n\f     Case 3:25-cv-0l780-WHA           Document 18-8        Filed 02/23/25     Page 4 of 19\n     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 78-7        Filed 03/20/25      Page 5 of 20\n\n\n\n 1           coordinating with the other HEGS POs and program support staff on program actions,\n\n 2           exceptionally well.\"\n\n 3       \u2022   \"Tom excelled in his first year as a permanent PO in BCS, having served as a VSEE rotator\n 4           previously.\"\n\n 5       \u2022   \"We look forward to Tom's continued growth as a permanent member of the scientific staff at\n 6           NSF.\"\n\n 7           16.     As of February 2025, I was serving as a Program Director for NSF programs\n\n 8   including: Confronting Hazards, Impacts and Risks for a Resilient Planet~ Sustainable Regional\n\n 9   Systems Research Networks; Human-Environment and Geographical Sciences Program; and\n\n10   Strengthening American Infrastructure.\n\n11           17.     The Confronting Hazards, Impacts and Risks for a Resilient Planet (CHIRRP)\n\n12   Program funds projects designed to advance understanding, forecasting and/or prediction of future\n\n13   Earth system hazards and risks, engage communities in development of research questions and\n\n14   approaches, and produce actionable, science-based solution pathways for adaptation methodologies,\n\n15   products, and services. The CHIRRP program is designed to address hazards compounded by\n\n16   changing climates, rising populations, expanding demands for resources, aging infrastructure, and\n\n17   increasing reliance on technology that are putting the country's economy, well-being, and national\n\n18   security at risk.\n\n19           18.     The Strengthening American Infrastructure (SAI) Program focuses on how\n\n20   fundamental knowledge about human reasoning and decision-making, governance, and social and\n\n21   cultural processes enables the building and maintenance of effective infrastructure that improves lives\n\n22   and society and builds on advances in technology and engineering. SAI funds pathbreaking\n\n23   fundamental research applied to strengthening a specific focal infrastructure.\n\n24           19.     I was also one of four Program Directors assigned to a working group at NSF\n\n25   developing funding opportunities to advance interdisciplinary research on the future risks associated\n\n26   with wildland fire. This group included ecologists, atmospheric scientists, and computer scientists,\n\n27   among other fields. I was the only social scientist in the group, and my position was therefore\n\n28\n\n     Declaration ofDr. Thomas Evans, No. 3:25-cv-01780-WHA                                 3\n                                            JA673\n\f     Case 3:25-cv-01780-WHA            Document 18-8        Filed 02/23/25     Page 5 of 19\n     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 78-7         Filed 03/20/25    Page 6 of 20\n\n\n\n 1   particularly important for ensuring that the team considered the critical role human behavior plays in\n\n 2   the vulnerabilities and risks associated with wildland fire.\n\n 3           20.    On the morning of February 18, 2025, I received an email instructing me to attend a\n\n 4   meeting with representatives of NSF human resources at 10:00 AM. I attended the hybrid meeting by\n\n 5   Zoom.\n\n 6           21.    At that meeting, representatives of NSF management announced the termination of\n\n 7   nearly 170 employees.\n\n 8           22.    There were numerous technical difficulties with the call. I was able to join at or\n\n 9   around 10:06 a.m., but others were continuing to join later. The presenters therefore repeated the\n\n10   termination announcement multiple times over the course of the meeting to inform newly arriving\n\n11   employees what was happening.\n\n12           23.    At this February 18, 2025 meeting, NSF confirmed that they considered my\n\n13   employment to be in fact subject to a two-year probation period, contrary to the terms outlined in my\n\n14   offer letter and personnel records.\n\n15           24.    For many other employees in a similar situation, this was the first time they became\n\n16   aware that they were not permanent employees. Multiple people asked questions about their SF-\n\n17   50s- which like mine also showed \"permanent\" tenure status--during the meeting. We were\n\n18   informed that regardless of the statements made by NSF when we were hired, and our personnel fi les,\n\n19   we were probationary employees under OPM's orders and interpretation of the law and regulations.\n\n20           25.    I received my official termination notice from NSF human resources via email at 2:56\n\n21   PM, effective at the end of the business day.\n\n22           26.    My termination letter stated: \"The Agency finds, based on your performance, that you\n\n23   have not demonstrated that your further employment at the Agency would be in the public interest.\"\n\n24   A true and correct copy of my termination letter is attached hereto as Exhibit B.\n\n25           27.    Based on the statements made by NSF at the 10 AM meeting and discussions with\n\n26   fellow employees, it is my understanding that all terminated probationary employees at NSF were\n\n27   given the same boilerplate language about the cause of our terminations. At the meeting, Micah\n\n28   Cheatham told us that NSF was given the option by OPM of terminating us due to performance or\n\n     Declaration ofDr. Thomas Evans, No. 3:25-cv-01780-WHA                                  4\n                                             JA674\n\f     Case 3:25-cv-0l780-WHA              Document 18-8      Filed 02/23/25       Page 6 of 19\n     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB              Document 78-7      Filed 03/20/25      Page 7 of 20\n\n\n\n 1   due to conduct, and that NSF chose performance, not because it was true, but because it would allow\n\n 2   us to claim unemployment.\n\n 3           28.     In total, nearly 170 employees were terminated out of roughly 1,500 at NSF.\n\n 4           29.     On information and belief, at least one NSF employee who worked at an NSF research\n\n 5   station in Antarctica joined the Zoom meeting and learned that she was one of the employees being\n\n 6   terminated.\n\n 7           30.     It is my understanding that at least 20 of the terminated employees had, like me, been\n\n 8   given prior documentation showing that they were no longer considered probationary employees.\n\n 9   Although the terminations were extremely abrupt for all of those ofus who were fired on February\n\n10   18, 2025, those of us who thought we had been pennanently employed did not believe that our jobs\n\n11   could be put at risk like this at all.\n\n12           31.     I knew that I would have one year of probationary employee status when I joined NSF,\n\n13   but when I successfully completed that period with outstanding ratings, I believed that I had job\n\n14   security as a permanent federal employee.\n\n15           32.     Many NSF employees are former professors who gave up tenured positions to work\n\n16   for the public interest and the advancement of critical research across the country.\n\n17           33.     The suddenness and scope of these terminations make it extremely difficult for my\n\n18   colleagues and me to find new jobs. Academic hiring is seasonal, and the fact that these unexpected\n\n19   terminations occurred in the middle of that cycle means that immediate j ob opportunities are very\n\n20   rare. Moreover, many of us are entering the j ob market at once due to these blanket terminations, and\n\n21   are therefore competing for a limited number of jobs in our fields. Even where there are openings,\n\n22   most are at the Assistant Professor level, further limiting the opportunities for senior scholars.\n\n23           34.     The termination of nearly 170 employees, including myself, also significantly reduces\n\n24   NSF's capacity to fulfill its core mission of advancing U.S. science and security.\n\n25           35.     The fact that the abrupt terminations were made with less than one day's notice means\n\n26   that the terminated employees had mere hours to provide crucial transition information before being\n\n27   locked out of NSF systems. I was only provided a few hours between being notified of my\n\n28   termination and being locked out of all the NSF IT systems in which to ensure that I had access to\n\n     Declaration ofDr. Thomas Evans, No. 3:25-cv-01780-WHA                                    5\n                                              JA675\n\f         case 3:25-cv-0l780-WHA                 Document 18-8                 Filed 02/23/25   Page 7 of 19\n         Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB             Document 78-7                     Filed 03/20/25   Page 8 of 20\n\n\n\n\n     ,L\n\n\n\n\n    tt\n\n     l\n\n\n\n\nto          ~                                                                                            d\n11\n\n12                                                        l   S.I '                                             t)(\n\nI                                   Th \\ fl Wlttru.lel~ rr:,J I C il}i:                                   tbm\n1                          .,   I   cnlicJd J'rogrM\\\nIS\n            cm                                                                   M\n\nIi\nl\n\n\n'                                                    l11di turc r,      1\n\n11\n12\n\n                                     ~t\\ Ofp:t,       ,       rxlt: 1hc ln\"     I th(   ~w\n..,                   \\f        lbs      ;QIJ    \\   ( l t:     W)    .bl .1n kt\n\n,.\n:,\n\n\n\n\n                                                      JA676\n\fCase 3:25-cv-01780-WHA   Document 18-8   Filed 02/23/25   Page 8 of 19\nCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB   Document 78-7   Filed 03/20/25   Page 9 of 20\n\n\n\n\n                  EXHIBIT A\n\n\n\n\n                             JA677\n\f                 Case 3:25-cv-01780-WHA Document 18-8 Filed 02/23/25 Page 9 of 19\n                 Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document 78-7 Filed 03/20/25 Page 10 of 20\n\n\n                                                 National Science Foundation\n                                    General Workforce (GWF) Performance Plan and Appraisal\n\nPart 1.

Tom completes the basic responsibilities of\n program management, recruiting panelists and ad-hoc reviewers, managing review panels, program budgeting, processing proposals, and\n coordinating with the other HEGS POs and program support staff on program actions, exceptionally well. Of note is that Tom has led the\n effort to deliver consistent pre-panel orientation for t he program group sessions and well as 1-on-1 sessions as needed. He also\n continues to adopt the power of technology such as PanelSolver and RoboRA to ease the workflow burden of HEGS. Notable this past\n  year is his effort to spearhead HEGS's volunteering t o run a panel using the new Proposal Evaluation System (PES) that is to be the\n replacement for Fastlane. Tom led coordinat ion with the PES team including orientation sessions, platform testing, and panelist training.\n The PES experience was quite positive with only m inor obstacles - the HEGS team is looking forward to the full PES rollout and was\n  pleased to be one (and the only SBE) program that contributed to the PES gamma test phase. It is very important to participate in the\n testing of new technologies at NSF and we are grateful that Tom volunteered and participated with HEGS to do so; feedback will be\n incorporated into the final version.\n\nTom continues to coordinate t he effort to re-envision the HEGS senior and DDRI programs by reworking the solicitations to (1) clarify to\nthe research community the types of scholarship that fall wit hin the scope of the HEGS program; (2) encourage submissions to HEGS that\nare currently underrepresented (such as proposals from GIScientists); and (3) ident ify mechanisms to re-invent the DDRI program to\nbetter serve the communit y and to diversify the topical representation in submissions and awards. The need for HEGS program revisions\nhas increased with the ending of the highly successful cross-directorate DISES program given the interest of those Pis to submit to HEGS\nvia the new ly imagined \"SHINE\" track.\n\nAs the lead of the program that links the social sciences with the physical sciences and engineering in SBE, Tom has become instrumental\nin providing SBE leadership and represent ation in environmentally oriented cross directorat e programs. This work includes co-chairing\nthe SBE-led CRISES program . Tom was instrumental in running the initial competition (planning and conference proposals) for t his\nprogram together with co-chair  I                  l trom SES under extreme t ime pressure. The development of the DCL and FAQs was\ndone quickly, with t he response impressive for such a new program. Over 150 concept outlines were submitted which had to be\ninternally reviewed and managed by a volunteer Working Group, and 15 award recommendations processed during an already busy\nclose-out season. It is due to Tom's leadership that the initial launch of CRISES was a success. Tom has continued to work with -       to\nlead CRISES.v2, now enlarged with representation from other directorates.\n\nTom is also involved in other activities, w idespread in their coordination with other directorates, where he is usually the sole SBE PO on\nmany working groups. Through his thoughtful cont ributions and leadership, SBE perspectives are integrated in these efforts.\n\n   1. Tom joined                          as co-chair of Sust ainable Regional Systems Research Networks (SRS RNs) in early 2024. While\n      -      handles most of the day-to-day work, Tom has been engaged with key decision-making and outreach. In 23-24, the SRS work\n       involved clearance of t he program solicitation, FAQ and webinar; work will ramp up during t he next reporting period.\n\n   1. Tom has long been involved as the SBE rep on t he Wildland Fire working group, based in BIO. HEGS was primary or co-funder on\n      about of the awards and SBE sciences have become a critical partner in the Wildland Fire program. Tom continues to work with the\n      Wildland Fire working group t owards a vision of a possible solicitation in FY25.\n\n   1. Tom served as one of several POs on the cross-directorat e Dynamics of Integrated Socio-Environmental Systems (DISES) -\n      supporting lead-          in the administration of DISES in 2023 when SBE lead in the program's management.\n\n   1. Tom also serves on the Strengthening American Infrastructure (SAi) program working group.\n\n   1. He is also on the cross-direct orate Clean Energy Technology working group and representing SBE.\n\n   1. He served on the directorate-less Advisory Committ ee on Environmental Research and Education (AC-ERE) work group ensuring the\n      highlighting of SBE matters.\n\nAlong with             Tom filled in on the Graduate Research Fellowship Program including running a GRFP panel for\ngeography/sociology in January 2024 on short not ice for a SES PO who was unable to participate. This program, along with HEGS's\nDDRIG program, is critical in the support of graduate students. A crucial new development toward the end of t he reporting period is\nTom's 50% detail to GEO-RISE to serve as founding co-chair of t he new program, Confronting Hazards, Impacts and Risks for a Resilient\nPlanet program (CHIRRP).

However, he has a very active IR/D plan as he collaborates with a cross-institutional team of scholars with whom he has\nworked for the past 10+ years on climate adaptation research in Sub-Saharan Africa. A highlight is serving as Co-Pl on a new $2M award\nfrom the Department of Defense Minerva program (Pl . . . .at U California Santa Barbara) that extends the group' s work on\nclimate adaptation in Zambia and Kenya to drivers and impacts of inter-personal conflict. The first phase of this project runs from 2023-\n2026 with a second phase contingent upon adequate performance in phase I. Tom was co-author on 4 peer reviewed manuscripts\npublished in 2023 (see list below).

The latter conference was an outreach trip but had unexpected professional development relevance in part because\nthe community attending Google Next and associated culture was entirely different than that of a typical academic conference. The\nindustry-focus of this event was an interesting perspective in the context of recent NSF efforts to promote use-inspired outcomes and\nintersections between basic science research and industry partnerships (SBE-TIP collaborations).\n\n\nProfessional\nDevelopment Rating         r Unacceptable (U) r Minimally Successful (MS) r Fully Successful (FS) r Very Good (VG) P' Outstanding (0)\nLevels:\n\n\n\n\n                                                                     JA682\n                                                                                                                          OPM FORM 5018 10/2018\n                                                                       5                                         PERF: NFO0 OM00 USAPerformance\n\f               Case 3:25-cv-0l780-WHA                   Document 18-8            Filed 02/23/25          Page 14 of 19\n                Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB                 Document 78-7            Filed 03/20/25          Page 15 of 20\nPart 8. Summary Rating Narrative\n\nTom excelled in his first year as a permanent PO in BCS, having served as a VSEE rotator previously. He is solid in managing the HEGS\nprogram collaboratively, and his work in extra-programmatic assignment has increased significantly as he settles into being a key SBE PO\non environmental cross-directorate activities, especially his leadership on the SBE led CRISES program. Tom's network of relationships\nacross NSF is deepening, with his current detail in GEO solidifying connections there. Tom is a true team player, willing to participate in\nefforts large and small, and willing to step up where there is a need. He has done this while continuing substantial scholarly work, and\nthis benefits SBE as he remains very well versed in current trends in human-environmental and environmental research. We look forward\nto To m's continued growth as a permanent member of the scientific staff at NSF.\n\n\nPart 9. Employee Self-Accomplishment Narrative\n\nProgram Planning and Management\n\nTom serves as one of 2.5 Program Officers assigned to t he Human-Environment and Geographical Sciences (H EGS)\nProgram. Responsibilities with HEGS have included recruiting panelists, conducting review pa nels, program budgeting,\ndeveloping review analyses, and coordinating with the other HEGS POs on program actions (e.g. co-review requests). A\nparticular role has involved the conduct of pre-panel orientations (approximately 20 sessions counting group sessions\nand also numerous 1-on-1 sessions for panelists who have confl ict with group slots). The three HEGS POs work well\ntogether and we find a way to keep HEGS on track one (or more) of us are tugged away for other priorities.\n\nTom continued to encourage eva luation and adoption of new NSF workflows in the past performance period. This\nincluded continued adoption of PanelSolver and RoboRA for HEGS program wor kflows.\n\nMore recently the HEGS program volunteered to r un a panel using the new Proposal Evaluation System (PES) that is to\nbe a replacement for Fastlane. Tom led the coordination with the PES team including orientation sessions, platform\ntesting and panelist training. The PES experience was quite positive w ith only minor obstacles - the HEGS team is\nlooking forward to the full PES rollout and was pleased to be one of the programs that contributed to the PES gamma\ntest phase.\n\nTom has worked with                                                            in re-envisioning the HEGS senior and DDRI\nprograms. The HEGS team is currently revising our program solicitations with the following specific aims in mind: 1)\nclarifying to the research community the types of scholarship that fall within the scope of the HEGS program, 2)\nencouraging submissions to HEGS that are currently underrepresented (e.g. GISci) and 3) identifying mechan isms to re-\ninvent the DDRI program and diversity of topics represented in submissions and awards. This process has involved\ncareful consideration of the program scope and mechanics. The HEGS team looks forward to submitting revised\nprogram solicitations for review in FY24. -       and \u2022 \u2022l have been high ly vested in this solicitation revision/strategic\ndirection process and hopeful ly we can find a period in 2024 when we have enough bandwidth to proceed carefully\nwith th is process. If done too hastily t here can be blowback from the Pl community but we have had enough meetings\nat th is point to proceed - in part this path is clearer now that the public announcement on the ending of DISES is soon\nto be released.\n\nProgrammatic and Scientific Communication\n\nTom has conducted numerous outreach events in the form of HEGS webinars, meetings with graduate student classes\nat various institutions (4 in 2023-2024 period) and presentations at conferences/workshops (AAG and Google Next in\n2023-2024 period). Tom frequently is the HEGS program officer coordinating ema il responses to Pis but th is is very\nmuch a team effort.\n\nTom promoted adoption of a tracking process (pinned spreadsheet in Teams) to ensure timely replies to Pis.\nCollaborative decisions include Pl inquiries of fit for HEGS, deciding if HEGS should participate in different\nprogrammatic inqu iries at SBE, and consideration of EOls from programs like UKRI and IUCRC. The HEGS program\nofficers have a fa irly consistent take on most inqu iries at this point - as the HEGS program officers have been working\ntogether for 1.5 years now it is common for the first PO who gets to a Pl inquiry to respond w ithout requ iring input\nfrom t he other 2 POs. But about 20% of our inqui ries are less clea r j udgement calls (e.g. UKRI or IUCRC consideration,\nPl inquiries on topics at t he edge of HEGS scope) in which case we use a tracking syst em to record positions from each\nof us. The tracking spreadsheet pinned in Teams has worked relatively well to solicit this input versus email where\nmessages can sl ip down in inboxes.\n\nRepresentation and Coordination\n\n                                                                JA683\n                                                                                                                 OPM FORM 5018 10/ 2018\n                                                                  6                                     PERF: NFOO OMOO USAPerformance\n\f              Case 3:25-cv-01780-WHA             Document 18-8          Filed 02/23/25       Page 15 of 19\n              Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB             Document 78-7         Filed 03/20/25       Page 16 of 20\nTom's representation within SBE and outside SBE has ticked up considerably in the 2023-2024 period. Tom continued\nto participate as a member of several cross-directorate working groups. These include the Wildland Fire working group\nthat saw the award ing of 16 plann ing proposa ls in 2023 - Tom was the managing PO for SBE on these awards and\nHEGS was primary or co-funder of 7 of the 16 awards. BIO supported 10 awards and GEO 7 awards. In other words, SBE\nwas a critical partner in the Wi ldland Fire 2023 portfol io, particularly when considering the relative budget s of SBE vs.\nBIO & GEO. Tom continues to work with the Wild land Fire working group towards a vision of a possible sol icitation in\nFY25. A less t ime consuming working group was the Clean Energy Technology working group and representing SBE at\nt he NSF working group for the Advisory Comm ittee on Environmental Research and Education (now handed off to\n                           as of Feb 2024).\n\nTom serves as a program director with the Dynamics of Integrated Socio-Environmental Systems (DISES) and\nStrengthening American Infrastructure (SAi) programs. These programs did not involve an inord inate amount of\nleadersh ip t ime as it is the PO lead that shoulders most of the burden                            respectively). But\nTom supported \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 i n adm inistration of DISES in the 2023 cycle and hand led a portion of the award/decline\ndecisions. Along with \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 Tom filled in on the Graduate Research Fellowsh ip Program includ ing running a GRFP\npanel for geography/sociology in January 2024 on short notice for a SES PO who was unable to participate.\n\nA more significant allocation of time in t he 2023-2024 performance period involved co-chairing t he SBE Centers for\nResearch and Innovation in Science, the Environment and Society (CRISES) with                       (SES) and -\n       Th is involved managing the rollout of t he CRISES DCL (planning and conference proposa ls), community\noutreach/webinars, coord ination of the 12 member working group, management of concept outline review (150),\nreview of full proposals (120) and processing awards (15). This was a big effort given the accelerated t imetable for\nCRISES but the working group succeeded in getting al l award and decl ine recommendations submitted before July\ncloseout. The working group members real ly stepped up to make t his timeline possible. Tom continues to work with\n-      to stand up a 2nd round of CRISES DCL coordinating revision of the DCL with WG members and SBE leadership.\n\nTom joined                    as co-chair of Sustainable Regional Systems Research Networks (SRS RNs) in early 2024.\n-      handles a sign ificant amount of the co-chair wor kload but Tom has been engaged at a higher level than\nanticipated in decision making and outreach (multiple meetings/week+ email traffic). So far the SRS work has involved\nclearance of the program solicitation, FAQ and webinar - coordination with the larger working group will ramp up in\nApril and review process of the $1SM proposals w ill start soon after the May 15 2024 deadline.\n\nIn March 2024 Tom started a deta il with GEO to co-chair the GEO Confronting Hazards, Impacts and Risks for a\nResilient Planet program (CH IRRP). This detail technically started March 10 2024 but the workload starting ticking up in\nFebruary 2024.\n\nOverall this cross-d irectorate work has been an increasingly significant t ime comm itment but has been reward ing as it\nleverages Tom's research experience leading and col laborating w ith interdisciplinary teams. Tom' s network of\nrelationships at NSF is developing and growing stronger due to the engagement on the working groups noted above.\nThis has involved learn ing how to strategically step in when there are opportunit ies to leverage SBE science in\ndiffer ent cross-directorate initiatives constr uctively and collaboratively.\n\nProfessional Development\n\nTom wound down his lab group at the University of Arizona w ith his transition from VSEE to permanent program\nofficer role in 2023. He continues to actively collaborate with a cross-instit utional team of scholars with whom he has\nworked for the past 10+ years on climate adaptation research in Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nA highlight is serving as Co-Pl on a new $2M award from the Department of Defense Minerva program (Pl -\nat U Ca lifornia Santa Barbara) that extends the group' s work on climate adaptation in Zambia and Kenya to drivers\nand impacts of inter-personal conflict. The first phase of th is proj ect runs from 2023-2026 with a second phase\ncontingent upon adequate performance in phase I.

I am the former Director of the United States Office of Personnel Management\n\n(OPM). I make this statement based on personal knowledge and if called as a witness could and\n\nwould testify competently thereto.\n\n       2.      I was appointed to the position of OPM Director by the President of the United\n\nStates on November 4, 2013, and I held that position until July of 2015.\n\n       3.      Prior to my appointment as OPM Director, I worked for approximately 20 years\n\nin local and federal government positions. I started my career as an elementary schoolteacher in\n\nDenver, Colorado, and then worked in local Denver government. I later served as the Deputy\n\nChief of Staff and Chief of Staff for the U.S. Department of Transportation, as Senior Advisor at\n\nthe U.S Department of Energy, and as Chief of Staff to the U.S. Secretary of Labor.\n\n       4.      Subsequent to my years of service in the federal government, I have remained\n\nactive in public service and civic affairs, including in my current position as the Co-Founder of\n\nthe Latina Initiative. The mission of the Latina Initiative is to encourage Colorado's Latina\n\nvoters to use their voices and their votes to influence elected leaders and policy makers\n\nthroughout the state. I served as a Trustee of the University of Denver from 2016 to 2021. I\n\n\n\n                                            JA692\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 78-9         Filed 03/20/25      Page 3 of 6\n\n\n\ncurrently serve as a member of the Board of Trustees of the Rose Community Foundation,\n\nCommissioner of the Denver Urban Renewal Board, and Conservation Colorado. In 2020, I was\n\ninducted into the Colorado Women\u2019s Hall of Fame for my lifelong commitment to public service.\n\n       5.      In my role as OPM Director, I was responsible for overseeing the office that\n\nserves as the Human Resources office for the entire federal government, and as a result, I am\n\nfamiliar with the civil service laws and regulations that govern recruiting, hiring, development\n\nand support for federal workers.\n\n       6.       From my time working at three federal agencies (Transportation, Energy, and\n\nLabor) and as the OPM Director, I am very familiar with the respective roles that federal\n\nexecutive agencies and OPM play with respect to hiring and termination of federal employees,\n\nincluding those employees considered to be probationary under the civil service system.\n\n       7.      Probationary employees are generally those who have worked for the federal\n\ngovernment in their positions for less than two years. These individuals can be quite experienced\n\nin their fields, and they often bring private sector, academic, and other government experience\n\nand talent that the federal government needs. This category of newer hires also includes the\n\nfuture of the federal workforce.\n\n       8.      During my time as OPM Director, the office worked to ensure that federal\n\nagencies were supported in their efforts to recruit and retain talent to serve our country.\n\n       9.      The probationary period plays a critical role in the evaluation and integration of\n\nnew employees. Prior to hiring, probationary employees undergo extensive screening and\n\ninterviews to assess their qualifications for the position. Once hired, the probationary period\n\nitself is designed to allow both the employee and employer to further assess the fit and suitability\n\nfor the role. During this time, evaluations, reviews, and mentoring are integral to the process.\n\nEmployers have a responsibility to conduct periodic assessments of the probationary employee\u2019s\n\nperformance, ensuring a fair evaluation of their capabilities as potential permanent staff. This\n\ncollaborative effort serves to confirm that only the most qualified individuals transition into the\n\npermanent workforce at the conclusion of the probationary period. All of these decisions are\n\n\n\n\n                                             JA693\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 78-9         Filed 03/20/25     Page 4 of 6\n\n\n\nmade at the agency or office level, where each entity assesses whether the individual\n\nprobationary employee is prepared for transition into a permanent position.\n\n       10.     I have become aware of the incoming Presidential Administration\u2019s actions with\n\nrespect to probationary workers throughout the country from reports in the press regarding mass\n\nterminations throughout the federal agencies. These reports are concerning and disturbing. It is\n\ninconceivable to me that the federal government would endeavor to eliminate the category of\n\nprobationary workers. This is not remotely in the public interest and, in my experience, these\n\nterminations appear to ignore the civil service laws and regulations that I implemented and\n\nenforced.\n\n       11.     In particular, to the extent that OPM was involved in directing federal agencies to\n\nterminate workers, I am not aware of any legal authority for OPM to issue such an order. The\n\nfederal agencies are authorized by Congress to make hiring and firing decisions, within the\n\nconfines of the federal civil service protections. Our role at OPM was to support those agencies\n\nin those decisions, not to make those decisions for them.\n\n       12.     The speed and extent of the terminations by agencies of large numbers of\n\nprobationary workers, in my experience, could only have occurred as a result of a central\n\nmandate. It is simply not possible, in my experience, for so many federal agencies to have\n\nindependently and simultaneously decided to terminate large numbers of their workers. That\n\nwould be unprecedented, and logistically impossible.\n\n       13.     In my experience, and under the laws and regulations that apply to federal\n\nemployment with which I am familiar, any agency that wished to release an individual, including\n\na probationary individual from employment, would conduct an individualized assessment of\n\nperformance. If the news reports are correct about the volume of the terminations, it is not\n\npossible for these agencies to have done proper assessments of all of these employees. Nor is it\n\nplausible that all these employees have performance issues.\n\n\n\n\n                                            JA694\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 78-9        Filed 03/20/25      Page 5 of 6\n\n\n\n       14.     In my experience, and under the laws and regulations that apply to federal\n\nemployment with which I am familiar, agencies determine whether to propose a reduction in\n\nforce. OPM does not propose reductions in force at agencies. And, any agency that wishes to\n\nconduct such a reduction would need to comply with the regulations governing reductions in\n\nforce, including by providing sufficient advance notice to employees, their representatives, and\n\nstate and local governments that may be affected. This is not an undertaking to be taken lightly\n\nand without planning. Agencies engage in significant advance planning before conducting a\n\nreduction in force, and they must respect the protections given to workers who are permitted to\n\ncompete for other federal jobs rather than lose their seniority, benefits, and compensation.\n\n       15.     I am disheartened to learn that the office that I led with pride, with a mission and\n\ndedication to supporting federal agencies and their employees, has been involved in what appears\n\nto me to be the wholesale mistreatment of federal workers.\n\n       I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the United States that the foregoing is\n\ntrue and correct.\n\n\n\nDate: ______________                                         ___/s/_Katherine Archuleta_____\n                                                             Katherine Archuleta*\n\n                                                             *A copy of the signature page\n                                                             bearing an original signature is\n                                                             attached hereto.\n\n\n\n\n                                             JA695\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 78-9        Filed 03/20/25      Page 6 of 6\n\n\n\n\n        l ~-   In my ~i:,erienre. and under the la~-s and regulations that apply ro federal\nem. oyment with \u00b7which I am fsmiliar. agencies determine \"'-hetbe\u00a3 to propose a reduction in\nforce.

I am over 18 years of age and competent to give this declaration. This declaration\n\nis based on my personal knowledge, information, and belief.\n\n       2.      I am a Research Assistant in the Office of the General Counsel for the American\n\nFederation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO (\"AFGE\").\n\n       3.      In my role as a Research Assistant, I conduct research for AFGE's attorneys and\n\nassist with certification and delegation matters. I have been assigned several special projects,\n\nincluding a project to catalog letters related to AFGE affiliates delegation of authority.\n\n       4.      Since February 18, 2025, however, I have spent most ofmy time reviewing notices\n\nand letters sent to AFGE related to actions taken by the current Presidential administration,\n\nincluding reviewing probationary termination notices that have been sent to AFGE.\n\n       5.      Due to the work related to probationary terminations, I have been unable to\n\ncomplete other important work I have been assigned.\n\n\n\n\n                                              JA698\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB            Document 78-10          Filed 03/20/25       Page 3 of 16\n\n\n\n       6.       Over the last two weeks I have catalogued over 100 letters AFGE's national office\n\nhas received from employees who were terminated during their probationary period. Many of the\n\nletters were unsolicited. I understand that there have been thousands more probationary\n\nterminations of employees AFGE represents.\n\n        7.      One such termination letter, which I have attached as Exhibit A, was distributed to\n\na probationary employee at the Department of Veterans' Affairs (\"VA\") at 7:09pm on February\n\n13, 2025. The employee's identifying information has been redacted.\n\n        8.      Exhibit A indicates that the probationary employee was being removed \"based on\n\n[their] performance.\" The letter fails to reference the employee's actual performance records, the\n\nspecific relationship of the employee's duties or alleged failing to the public interest, or the position\n\nof the employee to whom it was addressed.\n\n        9.      A copy of Exhibit A was displayed by Rep. Mark Takano, Ranking Member of the\n\nHouse Committee on Veterans' Affairs, in his questioning of Ms. Tracey Therit, VA's Chief\n\nHuman Capital Officer, on February 25, 2025, about the termination of these probationary\n\nemployees.\n\n        10.     A similar termination letter sent to probationary employees at the Department of\n\nEnergy (\"DOE\"), which I have included as Exhibit Band is similarly redacted, also references an\n\nemployee's performance as a basis for termination and states that the DOE's findings were \"per\n\nOPM instructions.\"\n\n        11.     I was also asked to review an email that I am attaching as Exhibit C, that was sent\n\nfrom the Defense Civilian Personnel Advisory Service to all Civilian Personnel Council Policy\n\nMembers, on February 26, 2025. In the email, all Department of Defense (DoD) components are\n\ndirected, in \"accordance with direction from OPM,\" that they \"must terminate the employment of\n\n\n\n\n                                               JA699\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 78-10          Filed 03/20/25      Page 4 of 16\n\n\n\nindividuals who are currently serving a probationary or trial period\" beginning February 28, 2025.\n\nThe letter further states that a template termination notice should be used and that the template was\n\n\"provided by OPM.\"\n\n        12.    I have reviewed the OPM template attached to the email marked as Exhibit C and\n\nhave attached it as Exhibit D. The template letter is nearly identical to the probationary termination\n\nletters used at other agencies and, like those, cites performance reasons as the basis for termination.\n\n        13.    With many of the termination letters sent to AFGE, employees provided additional\n\ninformation including, in some cases, copies of their performance evaluations.\n\n        14.    In forty-three instances, employees sent us copies of their performance evaluations\n\nwith their termination letters. Even though these employees' termination letters cited performance\n\nissues as the reason for their termination, the evaluations indicated satisfactory or above-average\n\nperformance. Indeed, most of the evaluations indicated performance at the highest level possible.\n\nAdditionally, many other employees provided statements from their supervisors affirming their\n\npositive performance, despite their termination letters claiming otherwise. Many of these\n\nsupervisor statements indicated that the employee terminated was the highest-performing\n\nindividual in their respective office or work area. Several employees also noted-or provided\n\nevidence-that their supervisors opposed their terminations. I am not providing copies of\n\nindividual termination letters here that I have reviewed because of concerns about retaliation.\n\n       15.     Recently, I was also asked to catalog termination letters and reduction-in-force\n\nletters involving USAID. The USAID letters are not included in those I previously catalogued.\n\n       16.     USAID issued reduction-in-force (RIF) letters to employees on February 23, 2025.\n\nUSAID also issued termination letters to probationary employees on February 24, 2025.\n\n\n\n\n                                              JA700\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 78-10         Filed 03/20/25      Page 5 of 16\n\n\n\n       17.     One USAID employee whose letters I reviewed received a RIF letter on February\n\n23, 2025, which noted that the employee had less than a year of service. The letter also explained\n\nthat the RIF was being taken applicable to \"civil service RIF regulations,\" and noted the employee\n\nmay have rights pursuant to those regulations, including the right to placement assistance. The RIF\n\nletter also stated that the employee would not be separated until April 23, 2025.\n\n       18.     On February 24, 2025, the same employee received a termination letter indicating\n\nshe was being immediately terminated as a probationary employee.\n\n       I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the United States that the foregoing is\n\ntrue and correct. Executed this 19th day of March 2025 in Washington, D.C.\n\n\n\n\n                                             JA701\n\f            Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 78-10           Filed 03/20/25    Page 6 of 16\n\nAndrew Huddleston\n\nFrom:                           Therit, Tracey\nSent:                           Thursday, February 13, 2025 7:09 PM\nTo:                             Mitchell, Jillian Y.\nSubject:                        Termination During Probation Notice\n\n\n\n                                                February 13, 2025\n\n     MEMORANDUM FOR Jillian Y Mitchell\n\n     FROM:                    Tracey Therit\n                              Chief Human Capital Officer\n\n     SUBJECT:                 Notification of Termination During Probationary Period\n\n     REFERENCES:              5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7511\n                              5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3321(a)\n                              5 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 315.803 and 804\n\n            This is to provide notification that the Agency is removing you from federal service consistent with\n     the above references.\n\n            On 4/21/2024, the Agency appointed you to your position. As documented on your appointment\n     Standard Form 50 (SF-50), your appointment is subject to a probationary/trial period. The agency also\n     informed you of this requirement in the job opportunity announcement for the position.\n\n             Guidance from the Office of Personnel Management (\u201cOPM\u201d) states, \u201cAn appointment is not final\n     until the probationary period is over,\u201d and the probationary period is part of \u201cthe hiring process for\n     employees.\u201d[1] \u201cA probationer is still an applicant for a finalized appointment to a particular position as well\n     as to the Federal service.\u201d [2] \u201cUntil the probationary period has been completed,\u201d a probationer has \u201cthe\n     burden to demonstrate why it is in the public interest for the Government to finalize an appointment to\n     the civil service for this particular individual.\u201d[3]\n            The Agency finds, based on your performance, that you have not demonstrated that your further\n     employment at the Agency would be in the public interest. For this reason, the Agency informs you that the\n     Agency is removing you from your position with the Agency and the federal civil service effective February\n     13, 2025.\n\n            You may seek review of this action. Such reviews include:\n\n              a. appealing this action to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) if you allege you were\n                 discriminated against due to marital status or partisan political reasons or your removal was\n                 not effected in accordance with the procedural requirements of 5 C.F.R. 315.805; or\n              b. requesting corrective action before the Office of Special Counsel (OSC) for prohibited\n                 personnel practices; or\n              c. pursuing a discrimination complaint with the Office of Resolution Management (ORM).\n\n            Please see below for details on your ability to file some of these claims concurrently. If you are not\n     a supervisor, you shall be deemed to have exercised your option to appeal this action at such time as you\n                                                         1\n                                                     JA702\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document 78-10 Filed 03/20/25 Page 7 of 16\ntimely initiate action to appeal to MSPB. If you believe this action constitutes a prohibited personnel\npractice, other than discrimination, under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b), including retaliation for protected\nwhistleblowing, you may elect to file either an appeal to MSPB, or request corrective action from OSC, and\nyour election is based on which election you file first. If you are not a supervisor, your election of one of\nthese options precludes the other. If you are a supervisor, the election of remedies does not apply to you,\nand you may pursue all three options. If you believe that this action was taken against you for discriminatory\nreasons, other than marital status or political affiliation, refer to the paragraph immediately below.\n\n        Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC): If you believe this action is based on\ndiscrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, pregnancy, age or disability, you\nmay file a complaint of discrimination. If you elect to file a complaint of discrimination, you may do so by\ncontacting the Office of Resolution Management (ORM) at 1-888-566-3982. Such a complaint will be\nprocessed in accordance with EEOC regulations at 29 C.F.R., Part 1614. Your initial contact with the ORM\noffice must be done within 45 calendar days of the effective date of this action.\n\n       If this action is also appealable to MSPB, such a discrimination complaint may be a \u201cmixed case\ncomplaint,\u201d or if you raise the issue of discrimination in any appeal to MSPB, it may be a \u201cmixed case\nappeal.\u201d You may not initially file both a mixed case complaint and a mixed case appeal on the same matter,\nunless you are a supervisor. If you are not a supervisor, whichever you file first, the MSPB appeal or the\ncomplaint of discrimination, will be considered an election to proceed in that forum and will determine the\nprocedures that will be followed. If you are a supervisor, you may elect both MSPB and EEOC.\n\n         Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB): If you appeal to the MSPB, your appeal may be submitted\nby mail, facsimile, by commercial overnight delivery, by electronic filing the MSPB Appeal Form ( https://e-\nappeal.mspb.gov), or in person at any time after you receive this letter, but not later than 30 calendar days after\nthe separation has been effected, or 30 calendar days after the date of the your receipt of this decision,\nwhichever is later. The address to mail your appeal can be found here: U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board |\nContacts and Locations (https://www.mspb.gov/about/contact.htm). You must submit an original and one copy\nof both your appeal and all attachments. If you do not submit an appeal within the time set by statute,\nregulation, or order of a judge, it will be dismissed as untimely filed unless a good reason for the delay is\nshown. The judge will provide you an opportunity to show why the appeal should not be dismissed as\nuntimely. A copy of the form is available by request if you are unable to access it at the MSPB\nwebsite. Please refer to the MSPB website (www.mspb.gov) for information regarding the appeals process\nand procedures that must be followed. You may be represented by an attorney or other representative of\nyour choice. If you believe this action was taken against you for discriminatory reasons, refer to the\nparagraph on EEOC. If you decide to file an appeal with MSPB, you should notify the Board that the\nagency\u2019s point of contact for this appeal is Ochcofrontoffice@va.gov\n         Office of Special Counsel (OSC): If you elect to request corrective action by the OSC\u2019s Complaints\nExamining Unit (OSC Appeal Form) (https://osc.gov/), your complaint will be limited to a determination as\nto whether the agency took one or more personnel actions against you in violation of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b)\n(prohibited personnel practices). This can include, but is not limited to, claims of reprisal for\nwhistleblowing and/or engaging in protected activity. If you are not a supervisor and you elect to request\ncorrective action with OSC, you will have waived your right to file an appeal with MSPB (if eligible),\nregarding the same matter, except as follows. If you are making a covered claim of retaliation for engaging\nin certain protected activities, or for making protected disclosures and OSC terminates its investigation\nand/or has not timely notified you it will seek corrective action, you may have the right to file an individual\nright of action (IRA) appeal to the MSPB. Such an appeal will be limited to an adjudication of whether you\nproved that your protected activity or disclosure was a contributing factor in the effected action (5 U.S.C. \u00a7\n1214; 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1221). If you are a supervisor, you may pursue remedies from MSPB and OSC\nconcurrently.\n\n                                                     2\n                                                 JA703\n\f             Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document 78-10 Filed 03/20/25 Page 8 of 16\n             If you are not a supervisor, whichever option you may choose to pursue regarding this action (an\n      appeal to the MSPB, a request for corrective action to OSC, or a discrimination complaint), shall be\n      considered an election by you to proceed under that appeal process. However, if you are not a supervisor,\n      you may still concurrently file a corrective action to OSC and a discrimination complaint. If you are a\n      supervisor, you may elect all three remedies concurrently.\n\n             Separating VA employees are required to return their PIV card to their PIV issuing office and their\n      government furnished IT equipment and peripherals to the Office of Information Technology (OIT) for\n      redeployment or disposition.\n\n              GFE Equipment\n              You will immediately take your equipment to the closest VA medical center or 810 Vermont Avenue\n      to turn in your IT equipment. The local OIT staff will collect all assigned government furnished equipment\n      (GFE), including peripherals such as monitors, docking stations, printers, etc.\n\n              Regardless of the original issuing site, all local IT teams will accept returned GFE and will adhere\n      to local procedures for equipment accountability.\n\n              A return receipt for the equipment will be issued to the employee by local IT staff to acknowledge\n      receipt of the employee\u2019s GFE and peripherals.\n              OIT Facility Requirements\n              Return any non-IT equipment, office and/or card keys, and PIV card to local facility.\n              If there is lost equipment a report of survey needs to be completed before you separate.\n\n\n              We appreciate your service to the Agency and wish you the greatest of success in your future\n      endeavors.

However, once you timely file a notice of appeal with the\nMSPB, you may not subsequently file an OSC complaint, or an EEO complaint on the same matter.\n\nAlternatively, you may seek corrective action under subchapters II and III of 5 U.S.C. chapter 12, by\nfiling a complaint with the Office of Special Counsel (OSC), www .osc.gov. If you seek corrective\naction with OSC by making an allegation of whistle blower retaliation, you may not subsequently file\nan appeal to MSPB on the same matter. However, an OSC complaint may be followed by an\nIndividual Right of Action (IRA) appeal to the MSPB under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1221. IRA appeals are limited\nto the issue of whether the agency took one or more covered personnel actions against you in\nretaliation for making protected whistleblowing disclosures. As a result, you will be forgoing the\nright to challenge this action on other grounds.\n\nAlternatively, you have the right to file a complaint with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity\nCommission (EEOC) consistent with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 712l(d) and 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1614.301\nand 1614.302. If you believe this action is based in whole or in part on prohibited discrimination (i.e.\non the basis of your race, color, religion, sex {pregnancy, sexual orientation, sexual harassment), age\n(40 or older), national origin, genetic information, disability (mental or physical) or reprisal for prior\nEEO activity), you must contact a BPA or DOE EEO counselor within 45 calendar days of the date\nyou received this decision. You have the right to file an EEO complaint after counseling. If you file\nan EEO complaint, you may not subsequently file an appeal with the MSPB on the same matter. Your\nEEO complaint will be deemed a \"mixed case complaint\" and upon acceptance by the agency you\nwill be advised of the mixed case complaint processing procedures and appeal options.\n\nThe Department of Energy provides employees and their family members with a comprehensive\nEmployee Assistance Plan (EAP).

Hester //Signed 2/25/2025//\n\nSUBJECT: Direction to Terminate Individuals Serving a Probationary or Trial Period in the Department of\nDefense\n\nACTION: Using the attached Notification of Termination During Probationary Period template, all\nDepartment of Defense (DoD) Components must terminate the employment of all individuals who are\ncurrently serving a probationary or trial period in the DoD, subject to the exceptions listed below, beginning\nFebruary 28, 2025.\n\nREFERENCES:\n\n   1. Acting Director, U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Memorandum, \u201cGuidance on\n      Probationary Periods, Administrative Leave and Details\u201d January 20, 2025\n      https://www.chcoc.gov/content/guidance-probationary-periods-administrative-leave-and-details\n   2. Notification of Termination During Probationary Period Template\n   3. DCPAS Reference Guide for HR Practitioners: Determining Appeal Rights of an Individual Serving\n      a Probationary Period_February 2025\n\nBACKGROUND: Following direction from OPM, reference (1), federal agencies have been thoroughly\nreviewing their rosters to identify individuals serving a probationary or trial period in mission-critical\npositions essential for executing agency functions and fulfilling national priorities. This review aligns with\nthe Administration's directive to streamline the federal workforce and ensure effective resource allocation.\n\nIn accordance with direction from OPM, beginning February 28, 2025, all DoD Components must terminate\nthe employment of all individuals who are currently serving a probationary or trial period. This requirement\nto terminate individuals serving a probationary or trial period does NOT apply to:\n\n           1. individuals whose positions have been designated as mission-critical;\n           2. nonappropriated fund (NAF) employees;\n           3. dual-status technicians;\n           4. political appointees;\n           5. appointments made under the Pathways program, or\n           6. individuals who have opted in to OPM\u2019s Deferred Resignation Program.\n\n\n                                                       1\n                                                   JA708\n\f          Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document 78-10 Filed 03/20/25 Page 13 of 16\n5 U.S.C. 3592(b)(1) prohibits certain involuntary removals of career Senior Executive Service (SES)\nappointees during the 120-day moratorium. Guidance regarding removals of probationary career SES\nmembers is forthcoming.\n\nAs provided by OPM, and for your convenience, a Notification of Termination During Probationary Period\ntemplate is provided in reference (2). Components should insert the appropriate information into this\ntemplate, as noted on the document. Ensure that termination dates comply with all applicable agency\npolicies and Collective Bargaining Agreements (CBAs), prioritizing the expedited process where\nfeasible. Additionally, it is recommended that DoD Components place individuals on administrative leave\nfor a period of three weeks prior to effecting the termination date. This period of time will allow the\nComponents sufficient time to conduct a review of non-exempt probationary and trial period employees to\nensure the termination of affected individuals is conducted based on accurate probationary or trial period\ndata.\n\nPrior to issuing any termination letters, management officials should consult with their local Human\nResources Office to confirm the probationary status of individuals, make appropriate determinations whether\nthe individual meets the definition of employee under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7511 requiring full due process and appeal\nrights, and confirm the individuals respective probationary period end date. To aid Human Resources\nPractitioners in this review, the DCPAS Reference Guide is attached at reference (4)\n\nFor individuals who meet the definition of employee, thus requiring full due process and appeal rights,\ntermination should not be accomplished using reference (2). For these employees, management officials\nshould work with their servicing employee relations practitioner to determine if there is cause for action in\naccordance with procedures established in 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 752.\n\nComponents should elect to deliver termination notices in a manner that allows for delivery in an effective\nand efficient manner, being mindful that notices are not required to be signed or delivered by an individual\u2019s\nimmediate supervisor, nor are they required to be delivered in-person. However, management officials\nshould take action to ensure that the notice is delivered prior to the termination being effected and that the\ndelivery of the notice can be verified. Additionally, management officials should review the letter before\ndelivery to ensure all details are accurate.\n\nIf Components elect to deliver the Notification of Termination During Probationary Period in-person, two\ncopies of the letter should be printed. Both copies of the letter should be date stamped and signed at the time\nof actual delivery. Upon meeting with the individual serving a probationary or trial period, one copy of the\nletter should be provided to the individual and the other copy should be retained for agency files. Consult\nwith the servicing Labor and Employee Relations practitioner to ensure compliance with any procedural\nrequirements of applicable CBAs, such as the requirement to provide the individual multiple copies of the\nletter.\n\nAdditionally, management officials must be cognizant of the anniversary date of the appointment of the\nindividual and the impacts this may have if the anniversary date is imminent (i.e., either the day following\nthe date of termination or prior to the individual\u2019s next scheduled duty day). If the anniversary date is\nimminent, management must ensure that the termination is effected prior to the end of the individual\u2019s\nscheduled tour of duty on the last duty day before the anniversary date of their appointment, specifically\nannotating the time of termination in the letter. In these scenarios, management officials should ensure\ntimecards accurately reflect the hours worked based upon the time of termination.\n\nUpon delivery of the Notification of Termination During Probationary Period to the impacted individual,\nproper follow-on steps should be completed in accordance with organizational out-processing checklists and\nprocedures. Such steps may include, but are not limited to, collecting the individual\u2019s government\n                                                       2\n                                                   JA709\n\f            Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document 78-10 Filed 03/20/25 Page 14 of 16\nequipment, to include the Common Access Card, and terminating their access to government e-mail and\nsystems. If, after termination, any personal effects remain in the workplace that the individual was not able\nto collect prior to their departure, management officials should take appropriate steps to return those items to\nthe individual in accordance with their organizational policies or practices. Additionally, after the\nNotification of Termination During Probationary Period is delivered to each impacted individual, an official\ntermination during probation or trial period personnel action must be processed in the Defense Civilian\nPersonnel Data System (DCPDS).\n\nPOINT OF CONTACT: DCPAS Labor and Employee Relations at: dodhra.mc-alex.dcpas.mbx.hrops-lerd-\ndata-call@mail.mil.\n\n   1.

In addition, OPM has\n      instructed Agencies to consider whether an employee\u2019s performance is in the best interest of\n      the government, in light of the President\u2019s directive to dramatically reduce the size of the\n      federal workforce.\n              Based on the OPM guidance referenced above, the Agency finds, based on your\n      performance, that you have not demonstrated that your further employment at the Agency\n      would be in the public interest.

My name is                 and I am an adult resident of            Maryland.\n\n        2.      I began working for the National Archives and Records Administrator (\"NARA'')\n\nas an                                               on approximately July 2, 2023. My duty\n\nstation was Washington, D.C.\n\n        3.      From the date of my hire, NARA classified me as a probationary employee. My\n\nprobationary period was two years, or until approximately July 1, 2025.\n\n        4.      On February 18, 2025, I received a video call via Teams from\n\n                                  my supervisor,\n\n-        and a union representative. On the call, they stated that, an hour prior, they had received\n\na call instructing them to terminate all probationary employees at OFR.\n\nand the HR representative made clear that it was not their decision to terminate my employment\n\nand that they were following instructions.                             both stressed that my job\n\n\n\n\n                                             JA732\n\f    Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB            Document 78-14         Filed 03/20/25       Page 3 of 8\n\n\n\n\nperformance was excellent and that NARA was not terminating me based on my job\n\nperformance.\n\n       5.      Later that day, I received a Notification of Termination During Probationary\n\nPeriod by email from NARA. The notice stated that \"[i]n accordance with the direction to\n\nagencies to reduce budgets, implement a hiring freeze, reorganize and reprioritize our work and\n\nprepare for a reduction in force, we have come to the conclusion that we cannot continue with\n\nthe current staffing levels.\" It then stated I was being terminated on this basis. The email did not\n\nidentify any issue with my performance or conduct, nor did it identify any conditions arising\n\nbefore my appointment to justify my termination.\n\n       6.      The February 18, 2025 Teams meeting was the first I had learned ofmy\n\ntermination. If I had more warning, I would have started looking for a new position\n\nimmediately.\n\n       7.      On March 19, 2025, I received a notice by email from\n\n                            that I was being reinstated to my position effective this coming\n\nMonday, March 24, 2025. The notice gives no reason why I am being reinstated.\n\n       8.      Between February 18, 2025 and my reinstatement on March 25, 2025, I have been\n\nunemployed. I applied for and received unemployment insurance benefits with the D.C.\n\ngovemrnent.\n\n       9.      During my period of unemployment, and likely for several weeks more, I have\n\nnot been able to afford to support the local economy in the same way. Unemployment insurance\n\nbenefits barely covers my mortgage and utility bills, not to mention food. I have stopped all\n\nother non-essential spending. Even though NARA is reinstating me, it will take me some time to\n\nget back on my feet.\n\n\n\n\n                                             JA733\n\f    Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 78-14           Filed 03/20/25    Page 4 of 8\n\n\n\n\n       10.

As documented on your appointment Standard Form\n             50 (SF-50), your appointment is subject to a probationary/trial period. The agency also informed you of this requirement in the job opportunity\n             announcement for the position. This probationary period is the final step of the examination process. An employee serving a probationary period may\n             be terminated during the one-year probationary period for any legitimate reason, e.g., performance, conduct, budget, etc. You were made aware of\n             and voluntarily accepted all these terms when you entered your position on June 30, 2024.\n\n             In its January 20, 2025, memorandum entitled Guidance on Probationary Periods, Administrative Leave and Details, OPM advised that \u201c[p]robationary\n             periods are an essential tool for agencies to assess employee performance and manage staffing levels.\u201d In accordance with the direction to agencies\n             to reduce budgets, implement a hiring freeze, reorganize and reprioritize our work and prepare for a reduction in force, we have come to the\n             conclusion that we cannot continue with the current staffing levels.\n\n             For these reasons, I regret to inform you that I am terminating you from your position of                                                   with the agency and the\n             federal civil service effective today.\n\n             Upon receipt of this termination notice, you are obligated to return all NARA issued property and your NARA identification card, in proper working\n             condition, to me. You may be held personally liable for the value of any NARA issued property not returned.\n\n             If you believe your probationary designation was erroneous, please contact labor.relations@nara.gov.\n\n             We appreciate your service to the Agency and wish you the greatest of success in your future endeavors. If you have any questions, please contact\n             labor.relations@nara.gov.\n\n             You may appeal this decision to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) if you allege that this action was based on partisan political reasons or\n             marital status.\n\n             If you elect to appeal to the MSPB, your appeal must be filed no later than 30 days after the effective date of this action, or 30 days after the date you\n             receive this letter, whichever is later. If you do not submit an appeal within the time set by statute, regulation, or order of the judge, your appeal will be\n             dismissed as untimely unless a good reason for the delay is shown. MSPB's regulations may be found at www.mspb.gov. An appeal may be prepared\n             and filed electronically at http://e-appeal.mspb.gov. The MSPB strongly encourages electronic filing to reduce delays caused by their increased\n             telework posture.\n\n             Alternatively, while it is not recommended, you may choose to submit your MSPB appeal using the attached MSPB Form 185. Mail the hard copy to\n             the appropriate MSPB office based on your location, which can be found at the following website:\n\n             Merit Systems Protection Board\n\n             https://www.mspb.gov/about/contact.htm\n\n             If you have prior military service and believe this action was based on discrimination for that service, you may file a complaint with the Department of\n             Labor or file an appeal directly with the MSPB. If you first file an appeal with the Department of Labor, you may not file an appeal with the MSPB until\n             the Department of Labor notifies you that it was unable to resolve the complaint.\n\n             If you allege the action taken against you was based in whole or in part on discrimination because of race, color, religion, sex, age (over 40), national\n             origin, or disability, you may appeal the discrimination allegation with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). To begin this process,\n             you must contact a counselor at (301) 837-0939 in NARA\u2019s Office of Equal Employment Opportunity (NEEO) within 45 calendar days of the effective\n             date of this action. Failure to contact an EEO counselor within the 45-calendar day timeframe may result in the dismissal of your appeal.\n\n             You may seek corrective action by the Office of Special Counsel (OSC) at www.osc.gov. Your appeal will be limited to a determination as to whether\n             the agency took one or more covered personnel actions against you in retaliation for making one or more protected whistleblowing disclosures, which\n             constitutes a prohibited personnel practice in accordance with Title 5 United States Code (USC) 2302(b). If OSC dismisses your claim, you may file\n\n                                                                                              JA737\nhttps //mail google com/mail/u/0/?ik 02bc0839d1&view pt&search all&permmsgid msg f 1824427290096377491&simpl msg f 1824427290096377491                                             2/3\n\f3/19/25, 3:58 PM                                                  Gmail - Fwd: POTTS, RANDALL ROBERTS - Notification of Termination During Probationary Period\n                                            Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB                   Document 78-14               Filed 03/20/25           Page 8 of 8\n             an individual right of action (IRA) appeal to MSPB, but MSPB will only adjudicate whether you proved that your protected disclosure was a\n             contributing factor in the effected action.\n\n             Whichever is filed first, an appeal to the MSPB, or a discrimination complaint, shall be considered an election by you to proceed under that appeal\n             process.

My name is                  , and I am an adult resident of Bethesda, Maryland.\n\n       2.      I began working for the Department of Defense (Defense) as a\n                                                                                 -         at the\n\n                                                                 which is overseen by the Defense\n\nHealth Agency, on February 10, 2025. My duty station was Bethesda, Maryland.\n\n       3.      From the date of my hire, Defense classified me as a probationary employee. My\n\nprobationary period was one year, or until approximately February 10, 2026.\n\n       4.      On March 5, 2025, I received by email a notice signed by Stephen L. Ferrara that\n\nDefense was terminating my employment effective March 26, 2025. See Exhibit 1.\n\n       5.      The notice cites guidance from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM),\n\nincluding that \u201cOPM has instructed Agencies to consider whether an employee\u2019s performance is\n\nin the best interest of the government, in light of the President\u2019s directive to dramatically reduce\n\nthe size of the federal workforce.\u201d\n\n                                                  1\n\n                                              JA739\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB            Document 78-15        Filed 03/20/25        Page 2 of 14\n\n\n\n        6.        The March 5, 2025, tem1ination notice I received also states, \"Based on the OPM\n\nguidance referenced above,. . finds, based on your perfo1mance, that you have not\n\ndemonstrated that your further employment with . . would be in the public interest.

The March 5, 2025, te1mination notice from Stephen L. Fenara was the first I had\n\nlearned of my te1mination. Ifl had more warning, I would have staited looking for a new\n\nposition immediately.\n\n        8.        I know of at least one other probationa1y employee at. . who received this\n\nsame letter signed by Stephen L. Fen ara.

The MUIA is responsible for providing unemployment benefits to Michigan\n\nworkers who have lost their job through no fault of their own.\n\n       4.      As Legal Advisor and Legal & Compliance Bureau Administrator, I have access\n\nto reports and claimant records that detail the federal employees with workstations in Michigan\n\nwho have filed a claim for unemployment benefits. I also oversee the implementation and\n\n\n\n                                                  1\n\n                                             JA756\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 78-17        Filed 03/20/25      Page 3 of 10\n\n\n\ncompliance of federally funded programs within the MUIA, ensuring certain expenditures align\n\nwith federal guidelines and regulations.\n\n       5.      The ongoing mass termination of federal workers is iJTeparably harming Michigan\n\nin several ways.\n\n       6.      To the best of my knowledge, the federal departments involved in the reduction of\n\nworkforce have not provided the MUIA with any notice concerning the mass terminations.\n\nHistorically, the federal employer provides its employees with a Standard Form 8 (SF 8 -\n\nUnemployment compensation for Federal Employees (UCFE) Program Notice to Federal\n\nEmployee About Unemployment Insurance). The SF 8 provides pertinent information that the\n\nMUIA needs to timely process the employee's claim for benefits and avoid unintended errors.\n\nFor example, the SF 8 provides the precise name of the employer, including its Federal\n\nIdentification Code (FIC) which is used to request wages. The MUIA shall request but shall not\n\nrequire an employee who is applying for benefits to submit their base period employer's\n\nunemployment account number or federal employer identification number. Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7\n\n421.28(8). Without the FIC, the employee is left to select what they think is the name of the\n\nemployer; often the employee is incorrect, which results in the wage request being sent to the\n\nincoJTect federal depaiiment. This results in a delay in processing the claim for benefits and a\n\ndelay in remitting payment of the benefits by anywhere from two to four weeks. Further, the\n\nlack of a SF 8, a claim for benefits may be monetarily denied due to misidentification of the\n\nemployer type and name, resulting in claimant having to use the protest process. In short,\n\nclaimants could be denied benefits simply because they ai\u00b7e unaware of the proper FIC\n\nmaintained by the employer and necessary to file an allowed monetary claim.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 2\n\n                                            JA757\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 78-17       Filed 03/20/25      Page 4 of 10\n\n\n\n       7.      Additionally, to the best of my knowledge, the federal departments that are\n\nterminating staff have also not provided those employees with the Standard Form 50 (SF 50 -\n\nNotice of Personnel Action), which provides the reason for separation. This information is used\n\nby the MUIA to determine eligibility for unemployment benefits. If the claimant provides the\n\nseparation reason and that reason is wrong, this leads to creation of unnecessary issues to address\n\nseparation and thereafter could lead to the employer filing a protest and thus a delay in providing\n\na claimant with necessary benefits.\n\n       8.      As detailed more below, the MUIA is seeing an increase in claims for\n\nunemployment benefits filed by ex-federal workers, who had workstations located in Michigan.\n\nAs oflast week, the MUIA has allowed 13 0 claims for benefits and has 171 benefit claims\n\npending wage information from the federal employers. Again, without the FIC, the MUIA must\n\nrely on the employee's information or conduct its own investigation where the employee does\n\nnot have the proper federal department. This is resulting in time delays with a few hundred\n\nclaims. These delays will only increase with the increase in number of benefit claims filed in\n\nthe weeks and months to come.\n\n       9.      Generally, the Michigan Employment Security (MES) Act (Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7\n\n421.1, et seq.), enacted in 1936, provides insurance benefits, over an extended period of time, to\n\npersons who become unemployed through no fault of their own.\n\n       10.     As a general matter, the federal Government is required to reimburse Michigan\n\nfor unemployment benefits provided to former federal employees. Specifically, Michigan is\n\nparty to an agreement with the United States Secretary of Labor, wherein the Secretary shall pay,\n\nas an agent of the United States, Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees (UCFE)\n\nunder 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8502(a).\n\n\n\n                                                 3\n\n                                            JA758\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 78-17         Filed 03/20/25       Page 5 of 10\n\n\n\n        11.     Under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8502(b), Michigan is reimbursed for UCFE payments to federal\n\nemployees in the same amount, on the same terms, and subject to the same conditions which\n\nwould be payable to them under Michigan Unemployment Compensation Law.\n\n        12.     In addition, the MUIA administers its federal-state cooperative unemployment\n\ninsurance program financed in large part by grants from the federal government pursuant to the\n\nSocial Security Act. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 501-503.\n\n        13.     The Michigan Unemployment Insurance Compensation Program, certified by the\n\nU.S. Secretary of Labor under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 502(a), provides for payment of insurance benefits for\n\nup to twenty (20) weeks to persons who find themselves unemployed through no fault of their\n\nown. Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 421.27(d). [This statute was recently amended to allow for the\n\npayment of benefits for up to twenty-six (26) weeks, effective April 2, 2025.]\n\n        14.    Pursuant to Mich. Comp. Laws\u00a7 421.32(a), an individual in Michigan who\n\nwishes to collect unemployment insurance benefits must file a claim in accordance with\n\npromulgated administrative rules and procedures adopted by the MUIA.\n\n        15.    Claimants file claims online using the MUIA' s claimant system to assert a claim\n\ninitially and to provide information to indicate the basis of the claim, the name of the claimant's\n\nprevious employer, the reason for the separation, work experience, and other relevant\n\ninformation. Mich. Comp. Laws\u00a7 421.28(1)(a); \u00a7 421.32(a); Mich. Admin. Code, R. 421.205(1)\n\nand 421.208(1 ).\n\n        16.    The reason for separation, along with other pertinent information alleged by the\n\nclaimant, is then transmitted to the claimant's employer(s) for notification of the filing (i.e., a\n\nmonetary determination). Mich. Comp. Laws\u00a7 421.32(b); Mich. Admin. Code, R. 421.205(1).\n\nThe employer may dispute the contents of the monetary determination, including but not limited\n\n\n\n                                                   4\n\n                                              JA759\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 78-17        Filed 03/20/25      Page 6 of 10\n\n\n\nto, the reason for the separation, the repotied wages earned, etc. Mich. Comp. Laws\u00a7 421.32(b);\n\nMich. Admin. Code, R. 421.205(2).\n\n       17.     Michigan law disqualifies some claimants from benefits depending on the\n\ncircumstances of their separation from employment. See Mich. Comp. Laws\u00a7 421.29-29a.\n\nDisqualifying circumstances include termination for misconduct, aggravated misconduct, and\n\ngross misconduct. Id.\n\n       18.     A claims examiner at the MUIA is charged with making an initial determination\n\non the claim. Mich. Comp. Laws\u00a7 421.32(a).\n\n       19.     If a claimant is determined to be monetarily eligible, if the claimant's most recent\n\nbase period or benefit year separation was for a reason other than \"lack of work,\" the agency\n\nshall issue a determination regarding non-monetary eligibility. Mich. Comp. Laws\u00a7 421.32(c).\n\n       20.     If a determination involves the resolution of a dispute of material fact, the claims\n\nexaminer must investigate by issuing a request for information to the employee and her\n\nemployer(s). Mich. Comp. Laws\u00a7 421.32(d). Once that disputed issue is resolved, a\n\ndetermination must be delivered to the claimant and the employer \"promptly.\" Mich. Comp.\n\nLaws\u00a7 MCL 421.32(a). If the determination is favorable to the claimant, payments must begin\n\n\"promptly.\"\n\n       21.     A claimant or employer may file an administrative appeal within 30 days. Mich.\n\nComp. Laws \u00a7 42 l.32a(l ). If no appeal is filed, the MUIA may redetermine the eligibility,\n\nbenefit amount, maximum benefits payable, and the decision to recover an overpayment on its\n\nown motion. Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 42 l .32a(2). If a redetermination is made, the MUIA must\n\nsend notice of the redetermination to the claimant and an employer entitled to notice. Mich.\n\nComp. Laws\u00a7 421.32a(2). A redetermination is final unless an appeal is filed, and such appeals\n\n\n\n                                                 5\n\n                                            JA760\n\f    Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 78-17        Filed 03/20/25      Page 7 of 10\n\n\n\nmay proceed through administrative and then judicial review. Mich. Comp. Laws\u00a7 421.32a(3);\n\n\u00a7 421.33(1); \u00a7 421.34(2); \u00a7 421.38(1), (4).\n\n       22.     The UIA' s latest data indicates that approximately 3 00 former federal employees\n\nhave applied for unemployment benefits since January 21, 2025.\n\n       23.     When an employer provides the initial report of separation to the MUIA, the\n\nemployer must indicate the reason for the separation, including whether the employee was fired\n\nfor cause, such as misconduct. If the Agency does not receive the appropriate notice with the\n\nseparation reason, it relies on the claimant's reason for separation. Later, when the federal\n\ndepartment provides the separation information on the Agency's Form 931, the issue may need\n\nto be reconsidered resulting in a delay in processing the claim. For example, some claimants are\n\nclaiming their separation as \"fired.\" While not required to apply for unemployment benefits,\n\nsome individuals have attached in their application their letter of employment termination from\n\nthe federal govermnent. Such letters indicate that these individuals were probationaiy employees\n\npurp01iedly terminated for cause. Some of these claimants chose \"fired\" for the sepai\u00b7ation; but\n\nthe UIA Form 931 (asking for the reason for separation) from the federal department indicates:\n\n\"PERMANENT LACK OF WORK DUE TO CHANGE IN PRESIDENTIAL\n\nADMINISTRATION RECENT EXECUTIVE ORDERS REQUIRED THE AGENCY TO\n\nTERMINATE THE EMPLOYEE.\" This sepai\u00b7ation reason now requires the MUIA to reconsider\n\nits original decision based on \"fired\" and issue a nomnoneta1y redetermination with the corrected\n\ninformation.\n\n       24.     When there is a dispute of material fact between the employer and the claimant,\n\nsuch as whether a termination was done for cause, the claims exaininer must send a written\n\nnotice to the claimant and the employer notifying them of a fact-finding process in which the\n\n\n\n                                                 6\n\n                                              JA761\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB            Document 78-17         Filed 03/20/25     Page 8 of 10\n\n\n\nparties can offer evidence for the MUIA to rely on in making its decision. Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7\n\n421.32(a), (d).\n\n        25.       Thereafter, the claims examiner must issue a written decision on the issue and\n\ndeliver it to the paiiies. Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 421.32(a). From that point, either paiiy may\n\ninitiate the administrative appeals process, which consumes a great deal of time and the\n\nadministrative resources of an administrative law judge and Appeals Commission members who\n\nmust conduct contested case hearings, deliberate over arguments, and draft decisions.\n\n       26.        This diversion of personnel will undoubtedly impede the timely processing of\n\nregular UI claims, creating significant backlogs and delays. The consequences will be far-\n\nreaching, affecting countless individuals who depend on swift resolutions to sustain their\n\nlivelihoods. By diverting resources, we compromise the efficiency and responsiveness of our\n\nclaims processing system, ultimately undermining public trust and exacerbating economic\n\nhardship.\n\n       27.        While the MUIA is only beginning to process these claims, our staff has already\n\nbegun the process of contacting relevant federal depaiiments to request information concerning\n\nseparation.\n\n       28.        I anticipate, however, that given the inconsistent position between the termination\n\nletters and USDA's report, and the consistency of the termination letters across agencies, at least\n\nsome federal agencies will maintain their position that the terminated probationary employees\n\nwere fired for cause, and ai\u00b7e accordingly ineligible, at least in part, for unemployment benefits\n\nunder Michigan law.\n\n       29.        As soon as we receive such an asse1iion, the MUIA will be required to follow our\n\nintensive and mandatmy investigative process. And while designed to ensure fairness, the\n\n\n\n                                                   7\n\n                                               JA762\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 78-17        Filed 03/20/25     Page 9 of 10\n\n\n\nprocedures impose a significant sh\u00b7ain on the MUIA's financial and temporal resources. Each\n\ncase demanding a fact-finding proceeding necessitates staff hours for sending the fact-finding\n\ndocument to the claimant and employer, reviewing the response and evidence, and drafting\n\ndetailed decisions. Moreover, the potential for subsequent appeals triggers a cascade of\n\nadditional hearings and reviews, diverting resources from other essential departmental functions.\n\n        30.     The cumulative effect of these investigations translates to substantial expenditures\n\non personnel, administrative overhead, and the technological infrastructure required to manage\n\nthe burgeoning caseload, ultimately depleting the MUIA' s budget and hindering its ability to\n\naddress other critical labor-related issues.\n\n        31.    Recent statements of the President and other federal officials have indicated that\n\nthe overwhelming majority ofrecent federal terminations were not for-cause firings, based on\n\nindividualized assessments of performance, but instead constitute a Government-wide effort to\n\nshrink the size of the federal workforce, an effective reduction in force.\n\n       32.     As a result, it is likely that the overwhelming majority ofrecently terminated\n\nfederal employees will in fact be eligible for state unemployment benefits, because they were not\n\nterminated for cause.\n\n       33.     However, the federal Government's pretextual claim that such terminations are\n\nfor-cause will necessitate extensive and ineparable investigat01y costs and resource expenditures\n\nby the Michigan Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity.\n\n       34.     Finally, Michigan will also bear increased costs in the form of unemployment\n\nbenefits of ex-federal employees. While the Federal government is generally required to\n\nreimburse Michigan for UCFE benefits, Michigan must pay such benefits in the first instance,\n\ndepleting the statewide trust fund that is supported by private employers in the state.\n\n\n\n                                                  8\n\n                                               JA763\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 78-17        Filed 03/20/25     Page 10 of 10\n\n\n\n       35.     Moreover, the U.S. Secretary of Labor has discretion to reimburse states for\n\nadministrative costs required to conduct the state unemployment compensation program. 42\n\nU.S.C. \u00a7 502(a). While Michigan has been and continues to expend additional resources\n\nnecessary to address the uptick in federal unemployment claims, it is thus entirely speculative\n\nwhether MUIA' s costs will be fully reimbursed.\n\n      Executed on March 19, 2025, at Lansing, Michigan.\n\n\n\n\n                                               mber Breitmeyer\n                                              egal Advisor and Legal & Compliance\n                                             Bureau Administrator\n                                             Michigan Unemployment Insmance Agency\n\n\n\n\n                                                  9\n\n                                             JA764\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB   Document 78-18   Filed 03/20/25   Page 1 of 11\n\n\n\n\n                         Exhibit O\n\n\n\n\n                              JA765\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 78-18         Filed 03/20/25       Page 2 of 11\n\n\n\n\n                              UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n                              FOR THE DISTRICT OF MARYLAND\n\n\n\n MARYLAND; et al.,\n\n                Plaintiffs,\n\n         v.

I am a resident of the State of New Mexico. I am over the age of 18 and have\n\npersonal knowledge of all the facts stated herein, except as to those matters stated upon\n\ninformation and belief; as to those matters, I believe them to be true. If called as a witness, I\n\ncould and would testify competently to the matters set forth below.\n\n       2.      I am currently employed by the New Mexico Department of Workforce Solutions\n\nas the Cabinet Secretary. I have been in this position since August 15, 2022.\n\n       3.      As Cabinet Secretary, I am the chief executive of the Department of Workforce\n\nSolutions, and ultimately oversee all divisions, including federal contracts, federal-state\n\nprograms, and federal funding.\n\n       4.      The Department administers a wide range of federally funded workforce and\n\ntraining programs, including but not limited to those authorized by the Workforce Innovation and\n\n\n\n\n                                              JA766\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 78-18        Filed 03/20/25     Page 3 of 11\n\n\n\nOpportunity Act (WIOA), that are vital to New Mexico\u2019s economic stability and workforce\n\ndevelopment.\n\n       5.      The Department of Workforce Solutions also is responsible for the\n\nUnemployment Insurance program, employment services, and labor market information.\n\n       6.      As Cabinet Secretary, I have access to comprehensive reports and financial\n\nrecords that detail the state of New Mexico\u2019s labor market, including claims for unemployment\n\nbenefits, and the allocation and distribution of federal funding received by the Department of\n\nWorkforce Solutions.\n\n       7.      The ongoing mass layoff of federal workers is irreparably harming New Mexico\n\nin several ways.\n\nEmployment Services Expenditures\n\n       8.      The Department of Workforce Solutions oversees Rapid Response, a coordinated,\n\nmultiple-partner strategy to provide immediate assistance to New Mexicans subject to mass\n\nlayoffs. Rapid Response is the state entity responsible for conducting outreach and providing\n\nunemployment services required by the federal Workforce Investment Act of 1998, as amended\n\nby the federal Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act of 2014. Specifically, a state rapid\n\nresponse program is required by both the federal Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act 29\n\nU.S.C. \u00a7 3174(A)(2)(i).\n\n       9.      The Department of Workforce Solutions also oversees WIOA Title III (Wagner-\n\nPeyser) and the Reemployment Services and Eligibility Assessments (RESEA), both of which\n\nfocus on career counseling and job placement.\n\n       10.     The Department works in close partnership with other stakeholders, such as the\n\n25 America\u2019s Job Centers across New Mexico, which provide localized assistance to both\n\n\n\n\n                                            JA767\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 78-18         Filed 03/20/25      Page 4 of 11\n\n\n\nemployers and employees across the state in both employment services and unemployment\n\ninsurance claims.\n\n        11.    The purpose of Rapid Response, Title III, and RESEA is to reduce reliance on\n\npublic benefit systems such as unemployment insurance; to promote economic recovery and\n\nvitality by developing an ongoing, comprehensive approach to identify, plan for, and respond to\n\nlayoffs and dislocations; and to prevent or minimize the impact of mass layoffs on workers,\n\nbusinesses, and communities.\n\n        12.    When notified of a forthcoming mass layoff, the Rapid Response team will\n\nquickly provide informational resources and reemployment services for workers, including but\n\nnot limited to: information and support for filing Unemployment Insurance (UI) claims,\n\ninformation on the impacts of layoffs on health coverage or other benefits, information on and\n\nreferral to career services, reemployment-focused workshops and services, and occupational\n\ntraining.\n\n        13.    In addition, the Rapid Response team will contact affected businesses to collect,\n\nverify, and distribute information regarding Rapid Response activities, it will coordinate with\n\nstate staff and local workforce area staff at the America\u2019s Job Centers in the affected area to\n\nprovide support for the affected workers. The Division of Unemployment Insurance will\n\nmobilize to streamline and expedite the processing of unemployment claims, Title III will initiate\n\njob fairs and rapid hiring protocols, and the RESEA program will identify claimants at risk of\n\nexhausting their unemployment benefits for additional services.\n\n        14.    The Rapid Response, Title III and RESEA teams also facilitate connections to\n\npartner agencies and organizations to ensure their ability to provide assistance to terminated\n\nworkers and their families, such as home heating assistance, food resources, and child care.\n\n\n\n\n                                             JA768\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 78-18         Filed 03/20/25       Page 5 of 11\n\n\n\n        15.     Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d)(3)(A)(i), the federal Government is required to\n\nnotify New Mexico, or \u201cthe State or entity designated by the State to carry out rapid response\n\nactivities under section 134(a)(2)(A) of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998\u201d of a plan for a\n\nreduction-in-force (RIF) of federal employees, generally at least 60 days in advance of any\n\nproposed RIF.\n\n        16.     The notices required by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d)(3)(A) are intended to trigger Rapid\n\nResponse activities since it is explicitly to be given to the state entity required to carry out Rapid\n\nResponse activities.\n\n        17.     Upon information and belief, neither the New Mexico Department of Workforce\n\nSolutions nor any other entity in the New Mexico State Government have received notice of a\n\nfederal reduction in force at any federal agency.\n\n        18.     Yet, as detailed more below, the Department of Workforce Solutions has already\n\nreceived 195 claims by ex-federal employees for unemployment benefits since February 2, 2025.\n\n        19.     Because our Rapid Response team received no notice of federal reductions in\n\nforce, the Department has been required to dedicate more staff, resources, and expenditures to\n\nfulfill our statutory mission.\n\n        20.     Because the Department has not received advance notice of which agencies are\n\nplanning to conduct mass layoffs, we have been forced to rely on public reporting and word-of-\n\nmouth to conduct after-the-fact outreach to potentially affected workers. Reacting after a layoff\n\nis far more resource-intensive than the advance planning and assistance process required by law.\n\n        21.     Moreover, the Department of Workforce Solutions has had to devote significant\n\nadditional staff time from communications and policy staff to conduct broad-based outreach to\n\ntry and identify recently terminated employees, and provide relevant resources and services.\n\n\n\n\n                                              JA769\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 78-18         Filed 03/20/25     Page 6 of 11\n\n\n\n       22.     Under normal circumstances, such personnel are engaged in general media\n\nstrategy around connecting New Mexicans to jobs, providing round-the-clock support for New\n\nMexico\u2019s 60-day legislative session, growing apprenticeship programs, and other affirmative\n\nefforts to help grow and support New Mexico\u2019s job market.\n\n       23.     Such staff have instead been dedicated to reacting to the latest layoff news, trying\n\nto identify affected federal agency and ex-employees, provide information, and otherwise adjust\n\nprocedures and resources to assist confused and unemployed New Mexicans in a complicated\n\nand rapidly evolving environment.\n\n       24.     The New Mexico Department of Workforce Solutions has expended over $23,000\n\nin personnel and operational costs between February 2, 2025, and March 10, 2025, to address\n\nthese extraordinary circumstances. In addition, the New Mexico Department of Tourism\n\nexpended $25,000 to assist in outreach to displaced federal workers.\n\n       25.     In sum, my office and the State are devoting significant time, resources and\n\nexpense, simply to identify workers subject to federal mass layoffs, conduct mass outreach, and\n\notherwise make resources available to potentially affected individuals in new ways, all because\n\nfederal agencies have failed to provide the legally required notice of mass layoffs.\n\nUnemployment Assistance Process\n\n       26.     The Department of Workforce Solutions manages claims for unemployment\n\nbenefits in New Mexico.\n\n       27.     New Mexico Unemployment Compensation benefits, created under the Social\n\nSecurity Act of 1935, provide for unemployment benefits for up to 26 weeks to individuals who\n\nfind themselves unemployed through no fault of their own. \u00a7 51-1-3, NMSA 1978.\n\n\n\n\n                                             JA770\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 78-18         Filed 03/20/25     Page 7 of 11\n\n\n\n       28.     As a general matter, the federal Government is required to reimburse New\n\nMexico for unemployment benefits provided to former federal employees. Specifically, New\n\nMexico is party to an agreement with the United States Secretary of Labor, wherein the Secretary\n\nshall pay, as an agent of the United States, Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees\n\n(\u201cUCFE\u201d) pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8502(a).\n\n       29.     Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8502(b), New Mexico is reimbursed for UCFE payments\n\nto federal employees in the same amount, on the same terms, and subject to the same conditions\n\nwhich would be payable to them under New Mexico Unemployment Compensation Law.\n\n       30.     The New Mexico Department of Workforce Solutions administers its federal-state\n\ncooperative unemployment insurance program, financed in large part by grants from the federal\n\ngovernment pursuant to the Social Security Act. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 501-503.\n\n       31.     Pursuant to \u00a7 51-1-8, NMSA 1978, an individual in New Mexico who wishes to\n\ncollect unemployment insurance benefits must file a claim in accordance with regulations\n\nadopted by the New Mexico Department of Workforce Solutions.\n\n       32.     Claimants file initial claims online using the Department\u2019s system, via telephone,\n\nor in person, to provide information to indicate the basis of the claim, the name of the claimant\u2019s\n\nprevious employer, the reason for their separation, and other relevant information. \u00a7 51-1-5,\n\nNMSA 1978; NMAC 11.3.300.301 and 11.3.300.308.\n\n       33.     After an individual has filed an initial claim, DWS sends a fact-finding\n\nquestionnaire to the employer to verify the information provided and allow opportunity for\n\nresponse to the information provided in the claim. Employers have 10 days to respond. If an\n\nemployer does not submit a timely response, DWS makes a determination based on the\n\ninformation available at the time. NMAC 11.3.300.308 NMAC.\n\n\n\n\n                                             JA771\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 78-18        Filed 03/20/25      Page 8 of 11\n\n\n\n       34.     Eligibility for unemployment benefits is determined based on criteria such the\n\ncircumstances of the separation from employment, whether sufficient wages have been earned in\n\nthe base period, and whether the claimant is able to work, available for work and actively\n\nseeking work. \u00a7\u00a7 51-1-4 through 51-1-8, NMSA 1978.\n\n       35.      After a claim is filed, DWS reviews the information provided by the claimant\n\nand the employer through the fact-finding process and issues an eligibility determination. A\n\nnon-monetary determination is made as to whether a claimant is qualified to receive benefits\n\nbased on their separation from employment. If the claimant is eligible for benefits, a monetary\n\ndetermination is made, based on the wages earned in the base period, to ascertain the weekly\n\nbenefit amount the claimant will be eligible to receive. \u00a7 51-1-8, NMSA 1978.\n\n       36.     An interested party may file an appeal of any determination issued by the\n\nDepartment by submitting a written request via mail, email, or their online unemployment\n\naccount. Unless an appeal is filed within 15 days of the determination, the original decision is\n\ndeemed to be the final decision of the department. If an appeal is timely filed, a telephonic\n\nappeal hearing is scheduled before an Administrative Law Judge, at which the parties can present\n\nevidence, witnesses, and testimony for a review. \u00a7 51-1-8, NMSA 1978, and NMAC 11.3.500.\n\nUnemployment Benefits Recent Experience and Investigatory Process\n\n       37.     The Department\u2019s latest data indicates that 195 former federal employees have\n\napplied for unemployment benefits since February 2, 2025.\n\n       38.     The primary geographic locations of unemployment claims from federal\n\nemployees are Albuquerque, Rio Rancho, Carlsbad, Santa Fe, and Las Cruces.\n\n       39.     The federal agencies that claimants have reported most frequently as their\n\nemployer are the US Department of Agriculture, the US Department of Interior \u2013 National Park\n\n\n\n\n                                             JA772\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 78-18          Filed 03/20/25     Page 9 of 11\n\n\n\nService, and the US Department of Interior \u2013 Bureau of Indian Affairs. In total, claimants have\n\nfiled claims naming 17 federal agencies as their employer.\n\n       40.     As stated above, when an employer provides the initial report of separation to the\n\nDepartment, the employer must indicate the reason for the separation.\n\n       41.     Upon information and belief, federal workers\u2019 termination notices have included\n\nstatements suggesting that they were fired for poor performance.\n\n       42.     The Department of Workforce Solution\u2019s procedures require that the claims\n\nadjudicator must investigate the reason for discharge.\n\n       43.     Under \u00a7 51-1-7(A)(2), NMSA 1978, the standard for disqualification of a\n\nclaimant is not whether they were fired \u201cfor cause\u201d or for poor performance, but rather, whether\n\n\u201cthe individual has been discharged for misconduct connected with the individual's\n\nemployment.\u201d \u201cTo be disqualifying, misconduct must evince a willful or wanton disregard for\n\nthe employer's interests and must significantly infringe upon legitimate employer expectations.\u201d\n\nOtero v. New Mexico Emp't Sec. Div., 1990-NMSC-007, 109 N.M. 412, 785 P.2d 1031.\n\nEmployees must receive adequate warnings prior to discharge. Chavez v. Employment Sec.\n\nComm'n, 1982-NMSC-077, 98 N.M. 462, 649 P.2d 1375.\n         I\n       44.     On February 11, 2025, President Trump issued Executive Order 14222, stating,\n\n\u201cAgency Heads shall promptly undertake preparations to initiate large-scale reductions in force\n\n(RIFs).\u201d In addition, numerous other statements of the President and other federal officials\n\nsuggest that the majority of recent federal terminations were not due to employee misconduct,\n\nbut instead constitute a government-wide effort to shrink the size of the federal workforce.\n\n       45.     Upon information and belief, the Department of Workforce Solutions anticipates\n\nthat given the consistency of the termination letters across agencies, at least some federal\n\n\n\n\n                                             JA773\n\f    Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 78-18         Filed 03/20/25      Page 10 of 11\n\n\n\nagencies will assert that the terminated probationary employees were fired for cause and are\n\naccordingly ineligible for unemployment benefits.\n\n       46.     To the extent that the Department determines that recently terminated federal\n\nemployees were not terminated for misconduct, they will be eligible for state unemployment\n\nbenefits. In any appeal of unemployment benefits, pursuant to the New Mexico Unemployment\n\nInsurance Employer Handbook, the employer carries the burden of proof in establishing the\n\nseparation was for reasons other than a layoff due to lack of work and in establishing the\n\nseparation was for misconduct.\n\n       47.     To the extent the federal government files timely appeals of federal workers\u2019\n\nclaims, the Department of Workforce Solutions is required to and will follow an intensive\n\ninvestigative process. Because they are designed to ensure fairness, the procedures impose a\n\nsignificant strain on the Department\u2019s financial and temporal resources. Each case demanding a\n\nfact-finding proceeding necessitates extensive staff hours for scheduling, conducting interviews,\n\nreviewing evidence, and drafting detailed decisions. The need to send notices, accommodate\n\nwitness testimony, and facilitate cross-examination further escalates the time commitment.\n\nMoreover, the potential for subsequent appeals triggers a cascade of additional hearings and\n\nreviews, diverting resources from other essential departmental functions.\n\n       48.     Upon information and belief, the federal Government\u2019s pretextual claim that such\n\nterminations are not reductions in force is likely to necessitate extensive and irreparable costs\n\nand resource expenditures by the Department of Workforce Solutions.\n\nIncreased Unemployment Benefits\n\n       49.     Finally, New Mexico will also bear increased costs in the form of unemployment\n\nbenefits of displaced federal employees. While the federal government is generally required to\n\n\n\n\n                                             JA774\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 78-18         Filed 03/20/25     Page 11 of 11\n\n\n\nreimburse New Mexico for UCFE benefits, New Mexico must pay such benefits in the first\n\ninstance, depleting the statewide trust fund that is supported by private employers in the state.\n\n        50.    Moreover, the U.S. Secretary of Labor has discretion to reimburse states for\n\nadministrative costs required to conduct the state unemployment compensation program. 42\n\nU.S.C. \u00a7 502(a). While New Mexico has been and continues to expend additional resources\n\nnecessary to address the uptick in federal unemployment claims, it is thus entirely speculative\n\nwhether the Department\u2019s costs will be fully reimbursed.\n\n        51.    To the extent that the federal government refuses to reimburse the New Mexico\n\nUnemployment Insurance Trust Fund for adjudicated claims, the Department of Workforce\n\nSolutions will be required to expend considerable resources in collection processes. In addition,\n\nthe Department may be required to seek funding to protect the UI Trust Fund from the state\n\nlegislature.\n\n               Executed on March 10, 2025, at Santa Fe, New Mexico\n\n\n\n\n                                              _____________________________________\n                                              Sarita Nair, Cabinet Secretary\n\n\n\n\n                                             JA775\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB   Document 78-19   Filed 03/20/25   Page 1 of 8\n\n\n\n\n                         Exhibit P\n\n\n\n\n                              JA776\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB         Document 78-19          Filed 03/20/25     Page 2 of 8\n\n\n\n                             UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n                             FOR THE DISTRICT OF MARYLAND\n\n\n       STATE OF MARYLAND, ET AL.,\n\n                    Plaintiffs,\n                                                                  Case No.: 1:25-cv-\n                        v.\n\n    UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF\n        AGRICULTURE, ET AL.,\n\n                   Defendants.\n\n\n\n\n                     DECLARATION OF\n\n        I,                        , swear under penalty of perjury,\n\n        1.     My name is                              and I am an adult resident of Washington,\n\nD.C.\n\n        2.     I began working for the U.S. Department of Agriculture (\u201cUSDA\u201d), in the U.S.\n\nForest Service, under                         , as a\n\n                              on approximately January 12, 2025. My duty station was\n\nWashington, D.C.\n\n        3.     From the date of my hire, the Forest Service classified me as a probationary\n\nemployee. My probationary period was one year, or until approximately January 11, 2026.\n\n        4.     On February 14, 2025, I received by email a notice signed by                  ,\n\n                                                     , that the Forest Service was terminating my\n                                                                                                 \u2022\nemployment, effective immediately.

I was not aware of my termination prior to Febrna1y 14. If I had more warning, I\n\nwould have had more time to look for a new position.\n\n        6.      I am now unemployed. I plan to apply for unemployment insurance benefits with\n\nthe D.C. government as soon as I am eligible.\n\n        7.      Unfortunately, I can no longer afford to support the local economy in the same\n\nway. For example, I canceled my contract with my personal trainer and will need reduce my\n\nexpenses significantly. Ifl do not find a new job in the next few months, I will need to relocate\n\nout of the District.\n\n        8.      Prior to my termination, my job duties as a\n\n\n\n\n        9.

Good to see counsel\n\n 3   again.\n\n 4           So let's introduce the matter.                                                         Plaintiffs, which include\n\n 5   19 states and the District of Columbia, filed suit against 41\n\n 6   defendants which included cabinet agencies, which I should say\n\n 7   include cabinet agencies, secretaries, other federal agencies,\n\n 8   the heads of those agencies.                                                The states challenged the\n\n 9   Government's termination of probationary federal employees\n\n10   specifically asserting that rights and interests of the states\n\n11   themselves were compromised by the manner in which the Federal\n\n12   Government proceeded.                                    The states allege violations of the\n\n13   Administrative Procedures Act and they generally accuse the\n\n14   Government of engaging in activities that are ultra vires.\n\n15           On March the 7th, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a\n\n16   Temporary Restraining Order.                                                The Court held a hearing on\n\n17   March the 12th and then granted the motion and issued a TRO on\n\n18   March the 13th.                          The TRO has a duration of 14 days, and\n\n19   accordingly expires tomorrow at I think about 8:15 p.m.\n\n20           On the 20th of March the states filed the motion that's\n\n21   technically before the Court now which is a request for a\n\n22   \u00a7 705 stay and a Preliminary Injunction.                                                                     The states have also\n\n23   asked that the TRO be extended.\n\n24           The parties helpfully proposed a briefing schedule which\n\n25   the Court adopted and then after some activity in the Court of\n\n\n\n                                                         JA856\n       Nadine M. Bachmann, RMR, CRR - Federal Official Court Reporter - 101 W.

And the\n\n 4   parties complied and I've received your briefs and they're\n\n 5   docketed at papers 101 and 102 in the electronic case file.\n\n 6           The Government separately filed a notice of appeal on the\n\n 7   14th of March.                        The Government sought an administrative stay\n\n 8   or a stay pending the resolution of the appeal.                                                                                 The Court of\n\n 9   Appeals denied the request and in fairness, their denial was\n\n10   tied to the following statement:                                                       Given the District Court's\n\n11   stated intention to hold a hearing on March 26, 2025 and to\n\n12   promptly grant or deny preliminary injunctive relief\n\n13   thereafter, the panel decided that it was appropriate to deny\n\n14   the request for a stay.                                        So that's my sense and understanding\n\n15   of where we are.\n\n16           First of all, Ms. Williamson, any quarrel with the\n\n17   Court's statement of our procedural history and status?\n\n18                         MS. WILLIAMSON:                               I believe the Court got it right,\n\n19   Your Honor.                   Thank you.\n\n20                         THE COURT:                      Mr. Hamilton, how does it sound to you?\n\n21                         MR. HAMILTON:                           No concerns, Your Honor.\n\n22                         THE COURT:                      Okay.              Well then let's go ahead and\n\n23   proceed.              The plaintiffs obviously go first.\n\n24           Do you have any evidence or testimony you want to present\n\n25   today or merely argument?\n\n\n\n                                                         JA857\n       Nadine M.

I should have\n\n 4   directed the clerk to move the standing desk in the position I\n\n 5   thought it would be there.                                             Let's take a second to get that\n\n 6   properly set up.                            Are we plugged in?                                    Check those mics.\n\n 7                         MS.

WILLIAMSON:                               As set out in plaintiffs' motion,\n\n12   the Court should convert the Temporary Restraining Order to a\n\n13   Preliminary Injunction covering all defendants.                                                                                 The analysis\n\n14   for a Temporary Restraining Order and a Preliminary Injunction\n\n15   as the Court knows are the same.                                                       The plaintiffs continue to\n\n16   meet all four factors.                                      They supplied even more argument --\n\n17   even more evidence indicating why a Preliminary Injunction is\n\n18   warranted at this stage.\n\n19           I would like to address, in particular, three arguments\n\n20   of the defendant agencies in arguing against continued relief\n\n21   in this case at this preliminary stage.\n\n22           First, the defendants' primary and truly only merits\n\n23   argument here is that these -- this mass termination of nearly\n\n24   25,000 people defendants say was not a reduction in force.\n\n25   Defendants say that instead, they describe it as in one point\n\n\n\n                                                         JA858\n       Nadine M.

They describe it in another place in their brief\n\n 4   as a decision that paying the salaries is unwarranted given\n\n 5   the agency's current priorities.                                                       But Your Honor, all of these\n\n 6   descriptions no matter the term or phrase are RIFs, they are\n\n 7   reductions in force.\n\n 8           We know that because there are regulatory provisions that\n\n 9   OPM established to tell an agency when it is conducting a\n\n10   reduction in force.                                 And one such occasion is a\n\n11   reorganization.                          That's the planned elimination, addition, or\n\n12   redistribution of functions or duties in an organization.                                                                                                 And\n\n13   \"function\" is defined in these regulations as all or a clearly\n\n14   identifiable segment of an agency's mission.\n\n15           So if an agency alters its mission such that it needs to\n\n16   reduce the number of employees or change the positions of\n\n17   employees, that is by definition a reduction in force whether\n\n18   that is described by the express terms of the regulation or\n\n19   described in some other similar term.\n\n20           So this is a reduction in force.                                                            The evidence -- not\n\n21   only does the regulation support that, but the evidence before\n\n22   the Court supports that.\n\n23           The defendant agencies relatedly argue that they may have\n\n24   some freestanding, independent authority to fire probationary\n\n25   employees through a mechanism that isn't written in the\n\n\n\n                                                         JA859\n       Nadine M.

The first is that if there were a mechanism to fire\n\n 4   probationary employees for no reason at all, for any reason,\n\n 5   it doesn't make sense that OPM would then have regulations\n\n 6   setting out specific procedures where certain types of\n\n 7   termination decisions were made.                                                       The defendant agencies would\n\n 8   merely every time say, I just want to fire this person if it\n\n 9   were that easy to fire a probationary employee for absolutely\n\n10   no reason.\n\n11           But even more importantly, Your Honor, the evidence here\n\n12   today certainly does not suggest that the defendant agencies\n\n13   relied on some freestanding authority.                                                                 The evidence shows in\n\n14   the letters that the probationary employees received, as well\n\n15   as in the declarations of the hiring authorities at these\n\n16   agencies that these were decisions, these were purportedly\n\n17   decisions to terminate for cause because of performance\n\n18   issues.\n\n19           So it's merely a post hoc rationalization to say that\n\n20   there's some sort of freestanding authority that the agencies\n\n21   might have apart from the OPM regulations.                                                                        There's no support\n\n22   for that in the record before you or in the regulations.\n\n23           Your Honor, I'd also like to address defendants' argument\n\n24   on standing.                     In the defendants' filing in opposition to\n\n25   plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction, defendants make\n\n\n\n                                                         JA860\n       Nadine M.

WILLIAMSON:                               Yes, Your Honor. So it seems they\n\n11   understood the direct link between the injuries that the\n\n12   states are suffering and the remedy here which is to remedy\n\n13   the harms that the state suffered because the defendant\n\n14   agencies went through these unlawful RIFs without notice.\n\n15           So Laufer doesn't provide otherwise.                                                                   Informational\n\n16   injuries are a viable form of injury as the Court recognized\n\n17   in its TRO opinion.                                 And that is the sort of injury that the\n\n18   plaintiffs suffered here, along with downstream harms stemming\n\n19   from those injuries and they seek redress for those downstream\n\n20   harms.\n\n21           The final issue I'd like to address with the Court is why\n\n22   uniform relief is warranted at this preliminary stage.\n\n23           So the harms to the state, Your Honor, the plaintiff\n\n24   states' harms, they are integrated into what a RIF actually\n\n25   looks like in practice and the fact that there's no way to\n\n\n\n                                                         JA861\n       Nadine M.

Not\n\n 4   all 50 states plus the District of Columbia have come before\n\n 5   this Court.                   The majority of the states in the country have\n\n 6   not joined this lawsuit; only 19 did, plus DC.                                                                               And as the\n\n 7   Court has attempted to make clear at every opportunity when it\n\n 8   was appropriate to do so, that despite the views of some that\n\n 9   the employees themselves were treated unlawfully, cruelly,\n\n10   inappropriately, they are not parties in this case.                                                                                       They are\n\n11   not before this Court.                                      And to the extent that they were\n\n12   wronged, A, this Court makes no finding in this regard; and B,\n\n13   this isn't the forum.                                    They go elsewhere.\n\n14           Other Courts have looked at it.                                                           The strong indication is\n\n15   that their remedy lies in an administrative agency, at least\n\n16   initially, in the Merit Systems Protection Board.

Much\n\n18   as some people would like to make it that case and much as\n\n19   some people who feel wronged and aggrieved believe it should\n\n20   be that case, it isn't.                                        It is the states, the states that\n\n21   specifically sued.\n\n22           So my question is how does a national injunction, uniform\n\n23   relief across the entire country or better yet, why is such an\n\n24   order, such an injunction, necessary to provide the relief\n\n25   that you contend the 19 states and DC are entitled to?

And the harm to the plaintiff states here before you\n\n11   today can only be remedied through a uniform preliminary\n\n12   injunctive relief at this stage.                                                       There are two --\n\n13                         THE COURT:                      Why can't I enter an injunction that\n\n14   just stops the Government's, from your perspective at least,\n\n15   illegal conduct vis-a-vis these 19 states and the District of\n\n16   Columbia?                And then that's it.                                     And then there's no contention\n\n17   that the Court has exceeded its jurisdiction, gone places that\n\n18   it didn't need to go, engaged in an unnecessary battle for\n\n19   whatever reasons with the Government, but exceeded what Courts\n\n20   should do which is confine themselves to the issues and the\n\n21   parties that are right in front of them.\n\n22                         MS.

The harms to the\n\n23   plaintiff states don't flow merely from the particular firings\n\n24   with the duty stations in their jurisdiction.

Because\n\n22   again, it's not the person, it's the state.\n\n23           And the Court's responsibility and objective here if it\n\n24   deems a PI to be appropriate upon a conclusion that the\n\n25   Federal Government did break the law, is to protect these\n\n\n\n                                                         JA864\n       Nadine M.

The\n\n 7   duty station in California is covered, but if the Court were\n\n 8   to issue relief that did not include Texas where the person\n\n 9   lives but doesn't work, then the relief would not -- there\n\n10   would still be issues as to social services, coverage of other\n\n11   forms of provision of resources that the state has to provide.\n\n12                         THE COURT:                      Why?            He lives in Texas.                                     Texas is not\n\n13   complaining.                     Texas is apparently completely happy and their\n\n14   position is they didn't feel any impact or if they did, they\n\n15   didn't join this lawsuit.                                           And the federal probationary\n\n16   employees who happen to reside in Texas, they may be upset\n\n17   about their situation, but they're not parties to this case so\n\n18   their interests are not squarely before the Court.                                                                                      The state\n\n19   of Texas isn't in here.                                        Maybe they are going to have all\n\n20   kinds of burdens in the form of increased unemployment\n\n21   insurance claims, increased dependence on social services, et\n\n22   cetera.            But that's for Texas to decide and they have not\n\n23   asserted those interests, rights.                                                         They haven't alleged a\n\n24   violation of the law by the Federal Government as it affects\n\n25   them and they haven't come here.                                                       So what's the problem?\n\n\n\n                                                         JA866\n       Nadine M. Bachmann, RMR, CRR - Federal Official Court Reporter - 101 W.

I'm trying to get you\n\n 4   to a more granular level.                                           Explain to me the harms endured and\n\n 5   cast upon the state of California where the -- okay, let's\n\n 6   come up with a hypothetical so we've all got a better image of\n\n 7   it.     These are complex issues and they're hard to handle on\n\n 8   the fly, but I need help with this.\n\n 9           So we've got an office that's in the state of California.\n\n10   Let's say it's the Bureau of Land Management, an agency of the\n\n11   United States Department of the Interior, a defendant in this\n\n12   case.         And the BLM has decided that they need IT assistance.\n\n13   And so they employ IT technicians, but IT work being what it\n\n14   is, even though this is the Bureau of Land Management, you\n\n15   don't actually have to be out on the land to do IT work for\n\n16   the BLM and the agency has made decisions that say it's okay\n\n17   for people to work remotely in this job.                                                                     They're technically\n\n18   working for the BLM office, let's say, in Sacramento,\n\n19   California.                   But for whatever reasons they want to live in\n\n20   Dallas, Texas.                        And so they live in Dallas, Texas.

That's\n\n22   where their kids go to school and that's where they physically\n\n23   go to work every day in their home office and they have for\n\n24   years.

I don't know the answer to that question off the\n\n17   top of my head.

There's a lot of things wrong\n\n11   with national injunctions just on a jurisprudential level.\n\n12   And courts and commentators are all over the issue and it's\n\n13   very current.                      That doesn't mean the Court won't enter one if\n\n14   the circumstances and law in this case compel it.\n\n15                         MS.

That might be\n\n 8   absolutely true and it might be completely chaotic and an\n\n 9   unintelligent way to run a national Government, but that's not\n\n10   the issue.                 The issue here is how their proceeding in that\n\n11   manner causes the 20 parties, the 20 plaintiffs in this case\n\n12   to experience less than the full remedy to which you contend\n\n13   they're entitled.\n\n14                         MS.

WILLIAMSON:                               Your Honor, I think an injunction\n\n15   crafted more narrowly would lead to a situation where full\n\n16   relief couldn't be offered to the parties at the end of the\n\n17   case and would lead to a circumstance where at least in some\n\n18   instances, the plaintiff states would likely continue to\n\n19   suffer harm from their need to continue to provide for\n\n20   employees who are not reinstated who have some connection to\n\n21   their jurisdiction.\n\n22                         THE COURT:                      So I don't think this has been\n\n23   adequately addressed in the briefs and I'm going to expand\n\n24   what I said a moment ago in terms of the supplementation\n\n25   that's due at 10:00 tomorrow morning, and that is to this\n\n\n\n                                                         JA872\n       Nadine M.

We would just\n\n11   ask that the Court enter the preliminary injunction.\n\n12                         THE COURT:                      Well, I have one more area that I want\n\n13   to get into and that is what technically triggers the\n\n14   obligation to give the notice?                                                   What triggers it?                                   Is it 50\n\n15   people in the competitive area?                                                     Is it 50 people in the state?\n\n16   And this is a complex question, particularly in densely packed\n\n17   metropolitan areas like the DC metropolitan area vis-a-vis\n\n18   Virginia.\n\n19                         MS. WILLIAMSON:                               Yes.            Your Honor, it's 50 people in\n\n20   a competitive area.                                 And a competitive area can be defined to\n\n21   include up to the entire agency.                                                       So a competitive area may be\n\n22   Baltimore, but it may be, for example, all of the Department\n\n23   of Homeland Security.\n\n24                         THE COURT:                      So let's suppose that the office is in\n\n25   Alexandria.                   100 people -- 100 probationary workers work there\n\n\n\n                                                         JA873\n       Nadine M.

And 60 of them live in Virginia, and 20 live in DC,\n\n 3   and 20 live in Maryland.                                         But the competitive area for\n\n 4   purposes of my hypothetical it's defined as, you know, this\n\n 5   agency office or region which is headquartered in that office\n\n 6   in Alexandria.                        So no questions, more than 50 people involved.\n\n 7   There's 100 people involved, but the majority of them live in\n\n 8   Virginia; 60 of them.                                    Only 20 live in DC, only 20 live in\n\n 9   Maryland.                Does Maryland as a state have notice rights in\n\n10   those circumstances?\n\n11                         MS. WILLIAMSON:                               Your Honor, the rule -- I just want\n\n12   to get the language specifically.                                                         So the statute itself says\n\n13   just a significant number of people.                                                              So query whether the\n\n14   statute itself might in that situation trigger the obligation\n\n15   because 20 might be considered a significant number.                                                                                         Under\n\n16   the regulation, the agency would -- I believe the agency would\n\n17   require -- would supply notice to Virginia, but not to\n\n18   Maryland and DC.\n\n19           But Your Honor, I should add that in this case the\n\n20   agencies proceeded with RIFs that were not so limited in\n\n21   geographic scope.                             They were RIFs that were nationwide of\n\n22   hundreds and thousands of people across multiple\n\n23   jurisdictions.                        So there was not -- because the agencies\n\n24   didn't go through the process of attempting to comply with the\n\n25   RIF procedures, they didn't themselves define a competitive\n\n\n\n                                                         JA874\n       Nadine M.

Congress didn't make\n\n 6   competitive areas congruent with state boundaries.\n\n 7                         MS.

In this case\n\n12   there was no attempt to define competitive area in some narrow\n\n13   fashion and instead, you see agencies like the treasury\n\n14   department firing several thousand people at once across the\n\n15   country.\n\n16                         THE COURT:                      Well, one of the problems that the Court\n\n17   faces in all of this is if it concludes that, in fact, these\n\n18   were RIFs, then it's really impaired by the fact that the\n\n19   Government didn't take the steps that the law requires,\n\n20   including defining competitive areas first before they acted.\n\n21                         MS.

And help me to understand how I would\n\n17   craft an order, craft an injunction that got the 20 parties\n\n18   the relief that they're entitled to under my theory, but then\n\n19   didn't extend in this sweeping way across the country without\n\n20   attention to the fact that 31 states presumably looked at this\n\n21   issue and decided not to join the case.

And it is so that the state\n\n 2   can carry out rapid response activities under \u00a7 134(a)(2)(A)\n\n 3   of the Workforce Investment Act.                                                       So the dispute really would\n\n 4   center on whether the state has Workforce Investment Act\n\n 5   obligations.                     And that's distinct from the other things that a\n\n 6   state law might obligate the state to do in connection with an\n\n 7   employee becoming unemployed.\n\n 8           And it should be enough for the states to know whether\n\n 9   they do or do not have these rapid response requirements.                                                                                                 The\n\n10   reinstating of employees is a separate issue that as Your\n\n11   Honor knows from our briefing it's our position that there's\n\n12   an entirely different way for those issues to be litigated\n\n13   through the Merit Service[sic] Protection --\n\n14                         THE COURT:                      Absolutely.                        But if I don't stop\n\n15   Virginia, if I don't stop you from doing what I say\n\n16   hypothetically are illegal RIFs in Virginia, and there are\n\n17   many Maryland residents who work at federal offices in\n\n18   Virginia.                So you go ahead and terminate them and they are\n\n19   then as I've said in my opinion, cast upon the state of\n\n20   Maryland, one of the parties in this case as a burden, they\n\n21   now have a responsibility to them that the Federal Government,\n\n22   Congress, imposed on them.\n\n23           So don't I have to come up with something that says\n\n24   listen, Federal Government, to protect the interests of\n\n25   Maryland and DC which I find are protectable in this\n\n\n\n                                                          JA877\n       Nadine M.

HAMILTON:                           Well, Your Honor, I'm not sure I\n\n 3   agree that the Workforce Investment Act casts these people\n\n 4   upon the states.                            What that act does is it creates this\n\n 5   program that obligates states to participate in providing\n\n 6   rapid response activities which I think are --\n\n 7                         THE COURT:                      But that's only triggered by virtue of\n\n 8   the fact that the people got terminated.                                                                     I mean, the state\n\n 9   doesn't have to do anything if the people haven't lost their\n\n10   jobs in significant numbers and come sweeping into the state\n\n11   agencies with a need for help.\n\n12                         MR. HAMILTON:                           So as far from what I understand the\n\n13   rapid response program is where states send individuals to\n\n14   provide information to persons who have been separated as part\n\n15   of large layoffs.                             This is something that happens both with\n\n16   private and public sector mass layoffs and that is distinct\n\n17   from whether employees are being reinstated to whatever\n\n18   employment they had before the mass layoff in question.\n\n19                         THE COURT:                      Well, the whole mission is to serve the\n\n20   suddenly unemployed who exist in sufficient numbers.\n\n21                         MR. HAMILTON:                           Yes, but I think the distinction is\n\n22   that whatever injury the states can complain about should be\n\n23   addressed by saying that the states can't be held liable by\n\n24   the Federal Government for not complying with the Workforce\n\n25   Investment Act.

I might not be correct about that.                                                                But anyways, there's\n\n 5   a federal program that the states work under and it seems like\n\n 6   a lot of this could have been sorted out through communication\n\n 7   between the agency and the states.\n\n 8           But an additional point that Your Honor noted earlier in\n\n 9   the hearing is the fact that not all reductions in force under\n\n10   the reduction in force statute require notice to states.                                                                                                  It's\n\n11   only those that the statute says is a significant number and\n\n12   then the OPM regulations add to that that it would be where\n\n13   there are 50 people or more in a competitive area.\n\n14                         THE COURT:                      Yeah, but in a competitive area, not in\n\n15   a state.              That's another thing -- that creates a real problem\n\n16   for the Court because they're not congruent.\n\n17                         MR. HAMILTON:                           Right.                And competitive area is\n\n18   defined under 351.402 and it can be quite small.                                                                                  That\n\n19   regulation says exactly what the minimum competitive area must\n\n20   be.     The minimum competitive area is one, a subdivision of the\n\n21   agency; two, under separate administration; three, within the\n\n22   local commuting area.                                    And it's only when that competitive\n\n23   area exceeds 50 employees --\n\n24                         THE COURT:                      But that's easily imagined in\n\n25   DC/Maryland/Virginia.\n\n\n\n                                                         JA879\n       Nadine M.

The 18 agencies\n\n 2   that had to comply with the Temporary Restraining Order, the\n\n 3   declarations that we've submitted show a variety in what\n\n 4   happened with probationary employees.                                                               I think I counted ten\n\n 5   had fewer than 500 probationers terminated agency wide.                                                                                              And\n\n 6   so once we -- and, you know, this hasn't been borne out in the\n\n 7   declaration --\n\n 8                         THE COURT:                      We're only at the preliminary\n\n 9   injunction.\n\n10                         MR. HAMILTON:                           Exactly.                   And we submitted\n\n11   information for compliance, not separate fact issues.                                                                                           But I\n\n12   don't know the extent to -- if those were measured on a,\n\n13   again, subdivision of an agency under separate administration\n\n14   within those subdivisions, then broken out by commuting areas,\n\n15   I don't know the extent to which the competitive area would\n\n16   have been triggered.                                  And the record --\n\n17                         THE COURT:                      Well, I think the Court unfortunately\n\n18   has to do some reasonable projection from the evidence that we\n\n19   do have, recognizing that we're at a very preliminary stage of\n\n20   the litigation, but I've still got to make a fundamental\n\n21   decision about whether relief is appropriate or not.                                                                                         And\n\n22   there may be some relatively small ones.                                                                     There are also some\n\n23   enormous ones, many thousands.                                                   The IRS comes to mind.\n\n24           So I'm still stuck with the problem of action that the\n\n25   Federal Government takes in a nonparty state that spills back\n\n\n\n                                                         JA880\n       Nadine M.

And if I'm determined to protect the\n\n 2   party state from that impact because I find that it otherwise\n\n 3   meets the criteria that I have identified, I'm struggling with\n\n 4   how I would design the injunction to forbid the Government\n\n 5   from doing that in Virginia, an example you and I have been\n\n 6   using, without sweeping more broadly than I need to do that.\n\n 7   And, of course, it's when these national injunctions -- I'm of\n\n 8   the view that sometimes a national injunction is entirely\n\n 9   appropriate and there are circumstances when that's crystal\n\n10   clear.          This isn't such a situation.                                                      This is murky.                             And the\n\n11   Court unfortunately has the responsibility to kind of wade\n\n12   into the swamp here and figure out if it can't draft something\n\n13   more restrictive that is not just easily sweeping across the\n\n14   country.\n\n15           That's a simple solution and easy to write, but as I\n\n16   discussed with your opponent, profound implications.                                                                                         This is\n\n17   a single district court in one district and I'm very sensitive\n\n18   to the issue that judges should not step beyond the authority\n\n19   that they have been explicitly granted.\n\n20           At the same time, judges have a responsibility to remedy\n\n21   the harms that are properly before them and to not shrink from\n\n22   doing that when the evidence, law and circumstances otherwise\n\n23   make it clear that that's appropriate.                                                                 I think that the\n\n24   instinct should be on the side of modesty, and caution, and\n\n25   that's where mine is.                                    But in that regard, I need help from\n\n\n\n                                                         JA881\n       Nadine M. Bachmann, RMR, CRR - Federal Official Court Reporter - 101 W.

And we'll try to\n\n 4   expand on that in what we submit tomorrow morning.                                                                                      But we\n\n 5   agree that there can't be a nationwide injunction here where\n\n 6   30 states have decided against litigating this at all and\n\n 7   another state --\n\n 8                         THE COURT:                      There can't be unless the Court finds\n\n 9   that there's no way not to do that and protect the interests\n\n10   of these 20 parties.\n\n11                         MR. HAMILTON:                           Right, right.                            And the interest of\n\n12   these 20 parties we start with the statute, 3502 and the\n\n13   notice provision in that statute which says that states are\n\n14   entitled to this notice when there's a reduction in force and\n\n15   it is specific in saying what the purpose is of the notice.\n\n16   It is to carry out the rapid response activities under \u00a7 134\n\n17   of the Workforce Investment Act.\n\n18                         THE COURT:                      Yeah, but the problem is that the states\n\n19   are -- these 20 states are unquestionably impacted by\n\n20   terminations that occur in nonparty states.

HAMILTON:                           That may be, Your Honor, but I think\n\n23   that's distinct from what the Workforce Investment Act\n\n24   requires.                And once plaintiffs start talking about lost tax\n\n25   revenue, providing unemployment insurance, those are\n\n\n\n                                                         JA882\n       Nadine M.

I'm\n\n 4   much more concerned about the impact on the capacity of states\n\n 5   to bring immediate services to the benefit of people who are\n\n 6   suddenly and unexpectedly unemployed.                                                               And that, to me, is\n\n 7   with crystal clarity what the congressional intent and purpose\n\n 8   was.       And accordingly, those are the Court's marching orders.\n\n 9   I've got to be faithful to that law.\n\n10                         MR.

The only thing I\n\n11   would add is that we read that statute to specify those state\n\n12   issues as the Workforce Investment Act, not the other things\n\n13   that state law might obligate a state to do when someone\n\n14   becomes unemployed, whether that be as part of a mass layoff\n\n15   or not like enrolling someone in unemployment insurance.\n\n16                         THE COURT:                      You have a very cabin confined view of\n\n17   the purpose of the notice.\n\n18                         MR. HAMILTON:                           We think it's the best reading of the\n\n19   statute and of the regulations.                                                     And again, I would make the\n\n20   point that it isn't all reductions in force under the statute\n\n21   that require notice to the states.                                                          It's only under these\n\n22   certain circumstances and the regulations give agencies\n\n23   decision-making authority in crafting that competitive area\n\n24   which would then determine whether or not a state is even\n\n25   entitled to notice in the first place.

I'll\n\n18   highlight just a few points because I think we have sharpened\n\n19   our arguments since the TRO opposition brief that we filed.\n\n20           I'll start with standing.                                                We think the plaintiffs lack\n\n21   standing here, all 19 states, as well as the District of\n\n22   Columbia.                The plaintiffs are focusing on this informational\n\n23   injury, but their theory of standing in connection with that\n\n24   is quite unusual because they aren't seeking the information\n\n25   from the Federal Government; they're, of course, seeking the\n\n\n\n                                                         JA884\n       Nadine M.

That isn't going to address\n\n 2   them not getting the information that they claim they should\n\n 3   have received when the Federal Government separated these\n\n 4   employees.                 Now there's a different --\n\n 5                         THE COURT:                      Well, if the employees are reinstated\n\n 6   they no longer need the information.

HAMILTON:                           I suppose, but the plaintiffs are\n\n12   complaining about not having gotten information, not -- I\n\n13   suppose I just see that as distinct.                                                              You think about a lot of\n\n14   informational cases might be FOIA litigation and someone, a\n\n15   plaintiff might say I'm entitled to receive a document and\n\n16   then the plaintiff has standing because they're seeking that\n\n17   document.                And that isn't what the plaintiffs are seeking\n\n18   here.\n\n19           As for the future terminations of probationers that might\n\n20   happen, plaintiffs can't satisfy the injury in fact element of\n\n21   standing.                These separations haven't even happened and that's\n\n22   also a problem under the Administrative Procedure Act because\n\n23   the APA allows review of agency actions, but plaintiffs can't\n\n24   even specify what these agency actions are with respect to the\n\n25   termination of future probationers.                                                            And so I won't rehash our\n\n\n\n                                                         JA885\n       Nadine M. Bachmann, RMR, CRR - Federal Official Court Reporter - 101 W.

We read that as\n\n10   really a sequencing sentence that is saying that when the\n\n11   statutory RIF section is implicated, the notice needs to\n\n12   precede the termination of employees.                                                               But there isn't\n\n13   anything in 3502 that says that the statutory RIF procedure is\n\n14   mandatory whenever something might colloquially be called a\n\n15   reduction in force.                                 Instead, that statute begins by telling\n\n16   OPM that it needs to promulgate regulations that give agencies\n\n17   this pathway and this forum to go through prioritizing\n\n18   different employees through this process for carrying out a\n\n19   reduction in force.\n\n20           And on the merits, our notice argument which is of course\n\n21   part of also our scope of relief argument, but the states of\n\n22   course are -- their claims ride on the premise that they were\n\n23   entitled to receive notice for each of the 21 agency\n\n24   defendants' reductions in force and they haven't carried their\n\n25   burden of showing that as so.

A hypertechnical\n\n 7   interpretation, but it gets us out of having to conform to\n\n 8   what was the obvious congressional purpose which was to\n\n 9   insulate states and let them have the opportunity to get\n\n10   prepared for the wave of unemployed people cast upon them when\n\n11   there's an in mass firing.

There is the notice requirement as part of 3502 and\n\n22   that has this tie into the Workforce Investment Act, but I\n\n23   don't read that as an overarching purpose of \u00a7 3502 of Title\n\n24   V.\n\n25              On the balance of the equities and public interest\n\n\n\n                                                            JA887\n          Nadine M.

Reinstating 24,000\n\n 5   probationary employees is an enormous expense for the Federal\n\n 6   Government that does not compare to the injuries that the\n\n 7   plaintiffs are complaining about.\n\n 8                         THE COURT:                      Courts sitting in equity whether it's at\n\n 9   the TRO stage or a PI stage has the responsibility to start\n\n10   with the status quo, the status quo ante in this circuit.

I'll give you\n\n 8   brief rebuttal.\n\n 9                         MS. WILLIAMSON:                               Yes, Your Honor.                                 Just two quick\n\n10   points.            First, Your Honor, my friend on the other side\n\n11   suggests that the states should have taken a different\n\n12   approach instead of seeking relief and the Court should have\n\n13   notified the agencies themselves of the issue.                                                                               But, of\n\n14   course, we know that 3502 places the burden on the Federal\n\n15   Government, the agencies, to notify in advance of the action.\n\n16           So here the states seek relief because of the agency's\n\n17   failure to follow that statute.                                                     It wasn't -- there isn't a\n\n18   provision or a mechanism for the states to relieve themselves\n\n19   of their rapid response duties through some sort of\n\n20   communication with the Government.\n\n21           The second point I'd like, Your Honor, is on the issue of\n\n22   remedy and particularly as it relates to my friend's standing\n\n23   argument, as Your Honor recognized, the notice here is no\n\n24   longer needed, but the question is how to remedy the plaintiff\n\n25   states' harm as a result of the defendant agency's failure to\n\n\n\n                                                         JA889\n       Nadine M.

So the information itself is sort of beside the point\n\n 5   at this point, as the Court recognized.

Give me a moment, counsel.\n\n 9           I'm going to have both counsel address one last issue.                                                                                            I\n\n10   did come in here with a laundry list of things that I wanted\n\n11   to cover and then as happens in hearings, we've jumped around\n\n12   a bit.\n\n13           Reinstatement as a remedy.                                                  Let me hear first from the\n\n14   Government on why reinstatement specifically is precluded\n\n15   because as I think you argue, it's not in the list of\n\n16   traditional equitable remedies that are authorized.                                                                                       What\n\n17   precludes it?\n\n18                         MR. HAMILTON:                           Thank you, Your Honor.                                           That's\n\n19   exactly right.                        We don't think that reinstatement is a remedy\n\n20   that federal courts are able to provide.                                                                     And that just really\n\n21   goes back to history and it being a remedy that there isn't\n\n22   much precedent for federal courts ordering federal agencies to\n\n23   reinstate federal employees to their work.

Instead, Congress decided\n\n 4   that some of those issues would be able to be litigated before\n\n 5   the Merit Services[sic] Protection Board.\n\n 6                         THE COURT:                      So your point is channeling is all that\n\n 7   is authorized.                        That because of channeling, the pathway to the\n\n 8   agency is all that is authorized.\n\n 9                         MR. HAMILTON:                           I think it's a little more than our\n\n10   channeling argument.                                  I think we just look at history and we\n\n11   don't really see precedent for this.                                                              And the fact that there\n\n12   is an additional statute that actually anticipates this\n\n13   question sort of adds an exclamation mark on that.\n\n14                         THE COURT:                      So what is the remedy?                                           Assume that\n\n15   despite your best arguments and compelling briefs and\n\n16   spectacular performance here in oral argument you lose on the\n\n17   merits.            Then what remedy, what's the remedy?\n\n18                         MR. HAMILTON:                           Well, plaintiffs at most could I\n\n19   think seek some sort of declaratory judgment about their\n\n20   obligations under the Workforce Investment Act, but, I mean,\n\n21   that is so distinct from what they're seeking here when trying\n\n22   to reinstate 24,000 probationers to Federal Government\n\n23   service.\n\n24                         THE COURT:                      Well, how else do you get the pressure\n\n25   off of the states, the pressure that at least in the TRO phase\n\n\n\n                                                         JA891\n       Nadine M.

How do you\n\n 2   relieve that pressure?                                      How do you get that load off of them\n\n 3   but by putting them back into their jobs?\n\n 4                         MR. HAMILTON:                           For better or worse, Congress created\n\n 5   a system under which there isn't a way for states to get\n\n 6   relieved of their administrative burden --\n\n 7                         THE COURT:                      So there's no remedy?\n\n 8                         MR. HAMILTON:                           There is no remedy for -- depending\n\n 9   on the injury we're talking about.                                                          I mean, I question whether\n\n10   the Workforce Investment Act would even give the declaratory\n\n11   judgment possibility, but that really is what this --\n\n12                         THE COURT:                      For decades, if not centuries, trial\n\n13   Courts have been told by their appellate superiors if there's\n\n14   a right, presumably there's a remedy.                                                               And it's the district\n\n15   court's job to find it.                                        It's not enough to just say well,\n\n16   they carved out a right here but, you know, there's no obvious\n\n17   remedy.            Done, leave them, marooned.                                                    That is not our law.                                    As\n\n18   a general principle, it's not.\n\n19           Now, you know, there can be circumstances where immunity,\n\n20   justiciability, this Court was involved heavily in\n\n21   gerrymandering litigation for years.                                                              Ultimately the Supreme\n\n22   Court decided that whatever the evils of gerrymandering might\n\n23   or might not be is just can't be fixed by courts.                                                                                    I\n\n24   understand that.                            But there certainly is an absolute duty and\n\n25   effort to try to find a remedy before coming to that throw up\n\n\n\n                                                         JA892\n       Nadine M.

HAMILTON:                           That's what I was attempting to\n\n10   address with my suggestion that at most, the states would be\n\n11   able to seek some sort of declaratory judgment about their\n\n12   obligations under the Workforce Investment Act which is the\n\n13   statute that this notice statute is expressly referencing.\n\n14                         THE COURT:                      So they get a DJ that basically says\n\n15   well, because the Federal Government didn't do what they're\n\n16   supposed to do, the states are relieved of their statutory\n\n17   responsibilities otherwise imposed on them by Congress.\n\n18                         MR. HAMILTON:                           I'd probably frame it more as they\n\n19   didn't have an obligation to do rapid response in the first\n\n20   place.\n\n21                         THE COURT:                      And then the whole purpose that caused\n\n22   Congress to act in the first place which was to protect the\n\n23   states and make sure that they can take care of their citizens\n\n24   is just sort of out the window.                                                     The Feds didn't do what they\n\n25   were supposed to do and the Court then gives the state\n\n\n\n                                                         JA893\n       Nadine M.

The court entered that\n\n        extraordinary relief at the behest of several states\u2014but not even one\n\n        affected employee\u2014to redress the purported violation of a notice\n\n        requirement. A motions panel of this Court stayed the district court\u2019s order\n\n        pending appeal, concluding that a stay was warranted because, among\n\n        other reasons, \u201c[t]he Government is likely to succeed in showing the district\n\n        court lacked jurisdiction.\u201d Order 4-5, Apr. 9, 2025 (Stay Order). That\n\n        conclusion was correct, and this Court should now vacate the injunction.\n\n              First, as the motions panel\u2019s stay order confirms, the district court\n\n        lacked jurisdiction to superintend the federal government\u2019s employment\n\n        relationships at the request of states that are strangers to those\n\n        relationships. The states lack Article III standing to complain of\n\n        downstream economic effects caused by the federal government\u2019s\n\n        employment actions, and the district court\u2019s attempt to repackage plaintiffs\u2019\n\n        injuries as \u201cinformational\u201d is a dead end. There is no connection between\n\n        the purported informational injury that the states assert and the sweeping\n\n        reinstatement remedy the district court ordered.\n\n\n                                               1\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248     Doc: 58       Filed: 04/16/2025   Pg: 9 of 56\n\n\n\n\n                Moreover, Congress has channeled all federal employment disputes\n\n        into an administrative process with judicial review in the Federal Circuit.\n\n        Allowing states to circumvent that process and challenge federal\n\n        employment decisions directly in district court would upend that\n\n        reticulated statutory scheme and contravene Supreme Court precedent\n\n        recognizing that where an exclusive remedial scheme permits claims by\n\n        only a particular class of plaintiffs, it shuts the door to claims by anyone\n\n        else.\n\n                Second, even if the district court had jurisdiction, its decision on the\n\n        merits rests on a fundamental misunderstanding of the relevant statutory\n\n        and regulatory provisions. Under federal law, a probationary employee\n\n        may be terminated, among other reasons, upon an agency\u2019s determination\n\n        that the employee has \u201cfail[ed] to demonstrate fully his or her qualifications\n\n        for continued employment.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.803(a). The district court\n\n        believed that the government had not identified sufficient cause for\n\n        terminating any probationary employees\u2014itself a remarkable conclusion to\n\n        reach in litigation to which the employees are not parties\u2014but the court did\n\n        not stop there. Instead, the court reasoned that since the government did\n\n        not have sufficient cause for the terminations, the government must have\n\n        actually conducted a reduction in force (RIF), a specific process for\n\n\n                                                 2\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248    Doc: 58      Filed: 04/16/2025    Pg: 10 of 56\n\n\n\n\n        eliminating positions that may require advance notice to states. 5 U.S.C.\n\n        \u00a7 3502(d). But even if the court were correct that the government lacked\n\n        sufficient cause to fire probationary employees, that would not mean that\n\n        the government had conducted unlawful RIFs\u2014it would just mean that the\n\n        probationary employees could challenge their terminations through the\n\n        mechanisms created by Congress, as indeed some are endeavoring to do.\n\n              Finally, the district court mis-weighed the equities in granting\n\n        preliminary relief. The states do not suffer any cognizable harm (let alone\n\n        irreparable harm) from the federal government\u2019s determination that it no\n\n        longer wishes to employ certain of their citizens. By contrast, the district\n\n        court\u2019s reinstatement order interferes with the government\u2019s ability to\n\n        manage its workforce, and \u201cthe Government is unlikely to recover the funds\n\n        disbursed to reinstated probationary employees\u201d if it later wins this case, as\n\n        the stay panel recognized. See Stay Order 5. Indeed, \u201c[t]he Supreme\n\n        Court\u201d recently \u201cstayed a similar preliminary injunction issued by the\n\n        United States District Court for the Northern District of California.\u201d Id.\n\n        (citing OPM v. AFGE, No. 24A904, 2025 WL 1035208, at *1 (U.S. Apr. 8,\n\n        2025) (mem.)).\n\n              To correct these errors, and the lopsided balance of harms they have\n\n        caused, this Court should vacate the injunction.\n\n\n                                               3\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 58       Filed: 04/16/2025   Pg: 11 of 56\n\n\n\n\n                           STATEMENT OF JURISDICTION\n\n              Plaintiffs invoked the district court\u2019s jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.\n\n        \u00a7\u00a7 1331 and 1361. See JA31. On March 13, 2025, the district court entered a\n\n        temporary restraining order, JA531, and the government noticed an appeal\n\n        from that order on March 14, 2025, JA535, docketed in this Court as\n\n        No. 25-1248. On April 1, 2025, the district court entered a preliminary\n\n        injunction, JA990, and defendants filed a notice of appeal on April 2, 2025,\n\n        JA995, docketed in this Court as No. 25-1338. This Court has jurisdiction\n\n        under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1). 1\n\n\n\n\n              1 Appeal No. 25-1248 of the district court\u2019s temporary restraining\n\n        order became moot upon the district court\u2019s entry of a preliminary\n        injunction.\n                                            4\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 58       Filed: 04/16/2025   Pg: 12 of 56\n\n\n\n\n                             STATEMENT OF THE ISSUES\n\n              On April 1, 2025, the district court entered a preliminary injunction\n\n        that required 20 different federal agencies to reinstate thousands of\n\n        previously terminated probationary employees. The issues presented are:\n\n              1. Whether the district court lacked jurisdiction over the states\u2019\n\n        claims where the states lack Article III standing and where Congress has\n\n        established a comprehensive system that provides the exclusive means for\n\n        reviewing the federal personnel actions at issue here.\n\n              2. Whether the district court erred on the merits in concluding that\n\n        because the federal government purportedly did not have sufficient cause to\n\n        terminate probationary employees, the federal government in effect\n\n        conducted an unlawful reduction in force, a separate type of employment\n\n        action that may require advance notice to states.\n\n              3. Whether the district court erred in holding that the states\n\n        established irreparable harm and that the balance of equities and the public\n\n        interest support a preliminary injunction.\n\n                      PERTINENT STATUTES AND REGULATIONS\n\n              Pertinent statutes and regulations are reproduced in the addendum to\n\n        this brief.\n\n\n\n\n                                               5\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 58       Filed: 04/16/2025   Pg: 13 of 56\n\n\n\n\n                              STATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\n              A.    Statutory And Regulatory Background\n              1.    \u201cCongress has provided for a probationary period since it\n\n        created the modern civil-service system with the 1883 Pendleton Act[.]\u201d\n\n        National Treasury Emps. Union v. Federal Labor Relations Auth. (NTEU),\n\n        737 F.3d 273, 276 (4th Cir. 2013). Under current law, the \u201cPresident may \u2026\n\n        provide \u2026 for a period of probation\u201d for federal employees \u201cbefore an\n\n        appointment in the competitive service becomes final.\u201d 5 U.S.C.\n\n        \u00a7 3321(a)(1); see id. \u00a7 7511(a)(1)(A) (providing up to one year of\n\n        probationary status for competitive-service employees). Exercising this\n\n        authority, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has issued rules\n\n        defining the probationary term for the competitive service and directing\n\n        agencies to \u201cutilize the probationary period as fully as possible to determine\n\n        the fitness of the employee\u201d and to \u201cterminate his or her services during\n\n        this period if the employee fails to demonstrate fully his or her\n\n        qualifications for continued employment.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.803(a).\n\n        Employees in the excepted service are subject to a trial period of up to two\n\n        years. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7511(a)(1)(B)-(C).\n\n              As the term \u201cprobationary\u201d reflects, \u201cemployees so designated are on\n\n        probation and subject to summary dismissal.\u201d NTEU, 737 F.3d at 276.\n\n        OPM\u2019s regulations provide procedural protections when agencies terminate\n                                           6\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 58       Filed: 04/16/2025   Pg: 14 of 56\n\n\n\n\n        probationary employees in certain circumstances. See id. The regulations\n\n        specify, for example, that where an agency terminates a probationary\n\n        employee \u201cbecause his work performance or conduct during th[e\n\n        probationary] period fails to demonstrate his fitness or his qualifications\n\n        for continued employment,\u201d the employee must receive notice \u201cin writing\n\n        as to why he is being separated and the effective date of the action.\u201d 5\n\n        C.F.R. \u00a7 315.804(a). Similarly, the regulations provide that where an\n\n        agency terminates a probationary employee \u201cfor reasons based in whole or\n\n        in part on conditions arising before his appointment,\u201d the employee is\n\n        entitled, among other things, to \u201cwritten notice\u201d and an opportunity to\n\n        respond. Id. \u00a7 315.805; see also id. \u00a7 315.806.\n\n              2.    Federal law also authorizes the government to conduct a\n\n        reduction in force, a distinct \u201cadministrative procedure by which agencies\n\n        eliminate jobs and reassign or separate employees who occupied the\n\n        abolished positions.\u201d James v. Von Zemenszky, 284 F.3d 1310, 1314 (Fed.\n\n        Cir. 2002); see 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502; 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.201. When conducting a\n\n        RIF, agencies must generally provide 60 days\u2019 advance written notice to an\n\n        employee who is to be released from employment, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d)(1)(A)-\n\n        \u2014and if the RIF would affect a \u201csignificant number of employees\u201d in a\n\n        jurisdiction, such notice must also be provided to \u201cthe State or entity\n\n\n                                               7\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 58       Filed: 04/16/2025   Pg: 15 of 56\n\n\n\n\n        designated by the State to carry out rapid response activities under section\n\n        134(a)(2)(A) of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998,\u201d id. \u00a7 3502(d)(1)(B),\n\n        (d)(3)(A)(i).\n\n              3.

Factual Background\n              On January 20, 2025, OPM transmitted a guidance memo to\n\n        Executive Branch agencies identifying probationary periods as \u201can essential\n\n        tool for agencies to assess employee performance.\u201d Memorandum from\n\n        Charles Ezell, Acting Dir., OPM, to Heads and Acting Heads of Dep\u2019ts &\n\n        Agencies 1 (Jan. 20, 2025). The memo directed agencies to \u201cidentify all\n\n        employees on probationary periods\u201d and \u201cpromptly determine whether\n\n        those employees should be retained at the agency.\u201d Id. On March 4, OPM\n\n        issued revised guidance emphasizing that agencies \u201chave ultimate decision-\n\n        making authority over, and responsibility for, such personnel actions.\u201d\n\n        Memorandum from Charles Ezell, Acting Dir., OPM, to Heads and Acting\n\n        Heads of Dep\u2019ts & Agencies 2 (rev. Mar. 4, 2025), https://perma.cc/E8P5-\n\n        74WZ.\n\n              Invoking their legal authorities to manage their workforces, several\n\n        federal agencies have terminated certain probationary employees.\n\n        According to plaintiffs, between February 13 and March 3, the government\n\n        terminated \u201cat least 24,000 probationary employees.\u201d See JA911. The\n\n\n                                              10\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 58       Filed: 04/16/2025   Pg: 18 of 56\n\n\n\n\n        plaintiff states allege that they \u201cwere not provided any advance notice of\n\n        such terminations.\u201d JA911.\n\n              C.    Prior Proceedings\n              1.    Plaintiffs\u201419 states and the District of Columbia\u2014 commenced\n\n        this action by suing 21 federal agencies on March 6, 2025, and they sought\n\n        a temporary restraining order the following day. See JA22; Dkt. No. 4. On\n\n        March 13, the district court entered a nationwide temporary restraining\n\n        order requiring the government to \u201cREINSTATE all Affected Probationary\n\n        Employees \u2026 FORTHWITH, and in any event before March 17, 2025, at\n\n        1:00 p.m. EDT.\u201d JA531. The court further restrained the government from\n\n        \u201cconduct[ing] any future [RIFs]\u2014whether formally labeled as such or not\u2014\n\n        except in compliance with\u201d notice and other applicable requirements.\n\n        JA531-532. The temporary restraining order did not extend to defendants\n\n        Department of Defense, National Archives and Records Administration,\n\n        and OPM, as the states failed to present sufficient evidence concerning\n\n        terminations at those agencies. See JA515.\n\n              The government endeavored to promptly comply with the court\u2019s\n\n        order in the limited time provided, see generally JA537-607, JA793-851,\n\n        while also seeking emergency relief from this Court, see Emergency Mot.\n\n        for Stay Pending Appeal, Mar. 17, 2025. On March 21, this Court denied\n\n\n                                              11\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248    Doc: 58       Filed: 04/16/2025   Pg: 19 of 56\n\n\n\n\n        the government\u2019s motion, noting the \u201cdistrict court\u2019s stated intention to\n\n        hold a hearing on March 26, 2025, and to promptly grant or deny\n\n        preliminary injunctive relief thereafter.\u201d See Order 2, Mar. 21, 2025. Judge\n\n        Rushing concurred, noting \u201cthe timing of the government\u2019s stay motion and\n\n        the district court\u2019s anticipated ruling on preliminary injunctive relief.\u201d Id.\n\n        at 4 (Rushing, J., concurring). But she criticized the district court\u2019s grant of\n\n        nationwide relief. See id. at 4-5.\n\n              2.    After extending the temporary restraining order, see JA852, the\n\n        district court entered a preliminary injunction on April 1. See JA906-994.\n\n        Like the temporary restraining order, the preliminary injunction stays the\n\n        \u201cpurported terminations of Affected Probationary Employees\u201d and provides\n\n        that defendants shall not \u201cconduct any future [RIFs]\u2014whether formally\n\n        labeled as such or not\u2014\u2026 except in compliance with\u201d statutory and\n\n        regulatory requirements. JA990-991. And the injunction directs agency\n\n        defendants to \u201cundo the purported terminations\u201d by \u201cTuesday, April 8,\n\n        2025, at 2:00 p.m. EDT,\u201d to the extent agencies have not already done so\n\n        pursuant to the temporary restraining order. JA990. The injunction\n\n        extends to two agencies not included in the temporary restraining order\u2014\n\n        the Department of Defense and OPM. See JA992-993. But the injunction\n\n        is geographically narrower than the temporary restraining order, insofar as\n\n\n                                               12\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 58       Filed: 04/16/2025   Pg: 20 of 56\n\n\n\n\n        it applies only to employees \u201c[w]hose duty station (prior to any purported\n\n        termination) and/or residence is in\u201d a plaintiff jurisdiction. JA993. The\n\n        district court recognized that plaintiffs had not shown at the preliminary-\n\n        injunction stage that nationwide relief was appropriate. JA979-981.\n\n              The district court\u2019s legal analysis was otherwise substantially similar\n\n        to the analysis supporting its temporary restraining order. With respect to\n\n        standing, the district court explained that the \u201cthe States\u2019 theory of injury\n\n        boil[s] down to one of informational harm\u201d because \u201ceach State did not\n\n        receive information to which it was legally entitled and each State\n\n        experienced harm as a result of that deprivation.\u201d JA916; see also JA924\n\n        (acknowledging that informational injury must cause real-world harm).\n\n        The court found that the states had sufficiently shown harms flowing from\n\n        the informational injury, including \u201cthe monetary costs and losses of\n\n        services associated with\u201d providing social services \u201cto the suddenly\n\n        unemployed.\u201d JA925. The court further accepted that a reduction of \u201cstate\n\n        income tax revenues\u201d that had already occurred was \u201creal enough\u201d for\n\n        purposes of Article III. JA926. The court found that these injuries were\n\n        caused by defendants\u2019 failure to provide notice, JA932-933, and that they\n\n        were redressable because reinstatements would rectify the \u201cdownstream\n\n        harms\u201d that flowed from the asserted informational injury, JA934.\n\n\n                                              13\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 58      Filed: 04/16/2025   Pg: 21 of 56\n\n\n\n\n              The court rejected the government\u2019s contention that the states\u2019 claims\n\n        concerning the termination of federal employment may be pursued only\n\n        under the CSRA and the FSLMRS, reasoning that the statutory scheme \u201cis\n\n        about where employees and unions must go to press claims relevant to\n\n        them\u201d but \u201cnot about where States may go to press wholly distinct claims\n\n        based on wholly distinct injuries.\u201d JA941.\n\n              On the merits, the court found that the termination of probationary\n\n        employees constituted a RIF because, in the court\u2019s view, the \u201cterminations\n\n        were not based upon any individualized review.\u201d JA951; see also JA952\n\n        (\u201cThe record reflects that the terminations were effected by means of form\n\n        letters terminating employees en masse, despite good performance by those\n\n        employees.\u201d). The district court then held that the government had failed\n\n        to comply with the requirements governing RIFs, including advance notice\n\n        to states. See JA963-969.\n\n              The district court found that the remaining preliminary injunction\n\n        factors were satisfied. It acknowledged that any harms faced by the states\n\n        were \u201clargely economic,\u201d but it found that they were irreparable because the\n\n        states \u201care unlikely to be able to recover money damages at the time of\n\n        judgment to remedy their harms.\u201d JA970. And it found that the balance of\n\n        the equities and the public interest favored the states. JA972-973.\n\n\n                                             14\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 58       Filed: 04/16/2025   Pg: 22 of 56\n\n\n\n\n              3.    The government again sought a stay pending appeal from this\n\n        Court. On April 9, a motions panel of this Court granted the government\u2019s\n\n        motion. Stay Order 4-5, (recognizing the government \u201chas satisfied the\n\n        factors for a stay under Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 426 (2009)). The\n\n        Court emphasized, in particular, that the government was \u201clikely to succeed\n\n        in showing the district court lacked jurisdiction over [the states\u2019] claims,\u201d\n\n        Stay Order 5, and that the government had established irreparable harm\n\n        because it \u201cis unlikely to recover the funds disbursed to reinstated\n\n        probationary employees,\u201d id. The motions panel further noted that the\n\n        Supreme Court had recently \u201cstayed a similar preliminary injunction issued\n\n        by the United States District Court for the Northern District of California,\u201d\n\n        which had directed the reinstatement of probationary employees at the\n\n        Departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture, Defense, Energy, Interior,\n\n        and Treasury.

As the\n\n        motions panel recognized in granting a stay pending appeal, the district\n\n        court lacked jurisdiction to enter the injunction at the behest of states who\n\n        allege downstream harms from the federal government\u2019s personnel\n\n        decisions. Nor was the court\u2019s reinstatement order otherwise proper.\n\n              I. As the Court recognized in granting a stay, the district court erred\n\n        in concluding that it had jurisdiction to hear this matter at all. The district\n\n        court committed two independent jurisdictional errors.\n\n              A. First, the states lack Article III standing. The states are strangers\n\n        to the federal employment decisions at issue, which concern agencies\u2019\n\n        decisions to terminate probationary employees. The states allege\n\n        downstream harms to their state resources and budgets from the federal\n\n        government\u2019s personnel actions, but the Supreme Court has made clear\n\n        that such indirect harms are not cognizable Article IIII injuries. See United\n\n        States v. Texas, 599 U.S. 670, 680 n.3 (2023). Repackaging those\n\n        downstream harms as an \u201cinformational\u201d injury does not resuscitate the\n\n        states\u2019 theory. An informational injury cannot by itself create Article III\n\n        standing but rather must cause \u201creal\u201d harms that \u201care of the type that have\n\n\n                                               17\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 58       Filed: 04/16/2025   Pg: 25 of 56\n\n\n\n\n        traditionally been regarded as providing a basis for a lawsuit in English or\n\n        American courts.\u201d Dreher v. Experian Info. Sols., Inc., 856 F.3d 337, 345\n\n        (4th Cir. 2017) (quotation marks omitted). And here, the only harms the\n\n        district court identified are the purported harms to state resources which\n\n        do not suffice. Nor, in any case, does any such \u201cinformational\u201d injury\n\n        support the district court\u2019s extraordinary reinstatement order, which does\n\n        not provide plaintiffs with any information they presently lack.\n\n              B. Second, even if the states had standing, the district court lacks\n\n        subject-matter jurisdiction because Congress has established a\n\n        comprehensive scheme for reviewing the personnel actions the states\n\n        challenge here. The CSRA permits certain categories of employees to\n\n        appeal certain personnel actions to the MSPB, with judicial review in the\n\n        U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The Supreme Court has held\n\n        that those who are not given appellate rights under the CSRA cannot bypass\n\n        that administrative-review scheme and seek judicial review in district\n\n        courts. United States v. Fausto, 484 U.S. 439, 445 (1988). Permitting\n\n        states to challenge federal personnel actions in federal court, without any of\n\n        the limitations that Congress placed on employees\u2019 own claims, would\n\n        upend the comprehensive scheme Congress established.\n\n\n\n\n                                              18\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 58       Filed: 04/16/2025   Pg: 26 of 56\n\n\n\n\n              II. The district court\u2019s merits analysis was likewise flawed. The\n\n        district court reasoned that the government had not identified sufficient\n\n        cause for terminating any probationary employee and that the government\n\n        must have therefore actually conducted RIFs that required notice to the\n\n        states. But even if the court were correct that the government lacked\n\n        sufficient cause to terminate probationary employees, that would not mean\n\n        that the government had conducted RIFs\u2014it would just mean that the\n\n        probationary employees could challenge their terminations through the\n\n        mechanisms created by Congress. A RIF is a specific type of personnel\n\n        procedure that eliminates a position, as opposed to terminating an\n\n        employee. The district court ignored this distinction and erroneously\n\n        concluded without relevant evidence\u2014which the states had the burden to\n\n        supply\u2014that the challenged personnel actions must have been \u201cessentially\n\n        reorganizations\u201d that amounted to a RIF.\n\n              III. Finally, the district court abused its discretion in ordering\n\n        reinstatement because the states failed to establish any of the equitable\n\n        factors necessary for such relief. The states failed to show an Article III\n\n        injury-in-fact, let alone imminent irreparable harm. And the public interest\n\n        and the balance of harms, which merge here, tilt sharply in favor of the\n\n        government. The district court\u2019s order requires the federal government to\n\n\n                                              19\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248      Doc: 58      Filed: 04/16/2025   Pg: 27 of 56\n\n\n\n\n        continue employing and paying unrecoverable sums to employees whose\n\n        services it has determined are no longer needed. In granting a stay pending\n\n        appeal, the motions panel necessarily concluded that the harms to the\n\n        government and the public interest outweighed any harm to the states. See\n\n        Stay Order 4-5 (citing Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 426 (2009)). For the\n\n        same reason that the balance of equities justified a stay pending appeal,\n\n        those lopsided equities show that an injunction never should have issued in\n\n        the first place.\n\n                                     STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n              \u201cA plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must establish,\u201d by a\n\n        \u201cclear showing,\u201d \u201cthat he is likely to succeed on the merits, that he is likely\n\n        to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, that the\n\n        balance of equities tips in his favor, and that an injunction is in the public\n\n        interest.\u201d Winter v. NRDC, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20, 22 (2008).\n\n              This Court reviews a preliminary injunction \u201cfor abuse of discretion,\n\n        with factual determinations considered for clear error and legal conclusions\n\n        considered de novo.\u201d United States v.

The District Court Lacked Jurisdiction.\n\n              As the motions panel determined in granting a stay pending appeal,\n\n        the states are unlikely to succeed on the merits because the district court\n\n        likely lacked jurisdiction. Stay Order 5. The states failed to establish\n\n        Article III standing, and Congress has divested district courts of subject-\n\n        matter jurisdiction to hear challenges to the federal personnel actions at\n\n        issue here.\n\n              A.      The States Failed To Establish Article III\n                      Standing.\n              States cannot sue the federal government on behalf of their citizens as\n\n        parens patriae. See Haaland v. Brackeen, 599 U.S. 255, 295 (2023). The\n\n        states therefore cannot establish Article III standing by relying on injuries\n\n        allegedly suffered by terminated probationary employees who are not\n\n        before the court.\n\n              Instead, to establish Article III standing, a state\u2014like any other\n\n        litigant\u2014must demonstrate that it has itself suffered an injury-in-fact that\n\n        is \u201cfairly traceable to the challenged conduct of the defendant\u201d and \u201clikely\n\n        to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.\u201d Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins,\n\n        578 U.S. 330, 338 (2016). In granting a preliminary injunction, the district\n\n        court concluded that the states have standing based on downstream harms\n\n                                              21\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 58       Filed: 04/16/2025   Pg: 29 of 56\n\n\n\n\n        to state budgets and operations from the termination of probationary\n\n        employees. E.g., JA926. That theory would permit states to access the\n\n        federal courts to supervise nearly any federal government action, and it is\n\n        irreconcilable with Supreme Court precedent.\n\n              1.    The states\u2019 standing theory rests on their assertions that, as a\n\n        result of the federal government\u2019s personnel actions, they will have to take\n\n        steps to provide resources to their citizens who were terminated and that\n\n        they will suffer losses to their tax bases. See JA56-64; Dkt. No. 78-1, at 7-8,\n\n        13-14.\n\n              That theory is foreclosed by Supreme Court precedent. In United\n\n        States v. Texas, states challenged a federal immigration policy that would\n\n        \u201cimpose[] costs on the States.\u201d 599 U.S. 670, 674 (2023). The states\n\n        claimed the federal government\u2019s immigration-enforcement decisions\n\n        would force them to \u201csupply social services such as healthcare and\n\n        education\u201d to additional persons. Id. The Supreme Court held the states\n\n        lacked standing, explaining that \u201cfederal courts must remain mindful of\n\n        bedrock Article III constraints in cases brought by States against an\n\n        executive agency or officer.\u201d Id. at 680 n.3. The Court emphasized that \u201cin\n\n        our system of dual federal and state sovereignty, federal policies frequently\n\n        generate indirect effects on state revenues or state spending.\u201d Id. And the\n\n\n                                              22\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248    Doc: 58       Filed: 04/16/2025   Pg: 30 of 56\n\n\n\n\n        states\u2019 theory of standing based on those \u201cindirect effects\u201d was too\n\n        \u201cattenuated\u201d to amount to a constitutionally sufficient injury. Id.; accord,\n\n        e.g., Arizona v. Biden, 40 F.4th 375, 386 (6th Cir. 2022) (rejecting\n\n        contention that any federal policy that \u201cimposes peripheral costs on a State\n\n        creates a cognizable Article III injury\u201d).\n\n              Similarly, here, the states assert that the federal government\u2019s\n\n        employment decisions have inflicted downstream harms on the states\u2019\n\n        budgets and resources. They allege, for example, that the terminations\n\n        have imposed burdens on state \u201cadministrative process[es] for handling\n\n        [unemployment insurance] claims,\u201d JA57-58; threatened increased\n\n        enrollment in social services such as Medicaid, e.g., JA64; and caused the\n\n        states to expend funds to establish informational resources for their\n\n        citizens, e.g., JA56, JA63-64. Such harms are not cognizable injuries-in-\n\n        fact. See Texas, 599 U.S. at 674, 680 n.3. Were the rule otherwise, states\n\n        could claim standing to second-guess nearly any federal personnel\n\n        decision\u2014whether that be hirings, firings, relocations, etc.\u2014on the theory\n\n        that the decision has a downstream effect on state resources. The theory\n\n        could reach far beyond federal personnel decisions, too, to the litany of\n\n        federal policies that \u201cfrequently generate indirect effects on state revenues\n\n\n\n\n                                               23\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 58       Filed: 04/16/2025   Pg: 31 of 56\n\n\n\n\n        or state spending.\u201d Id. at 680 n.3; see Arizona, 40 F.4th at 386 (rejecting a\n\n        peripheral-costs theory as \u201cboundless\u201d and \u201ca bridge much too far\u201d).\n\n              The district court erred in suggesting that Texas is distinguishable\n\n        because it involved a challenge to \u201ccore Executive Branch functions.\u201d See\n\n        JA928-929. Although the Court in Texas stressed numerous reasons why\n\n        \u201cfederal courts have not traditionally entertained lawsuits\u201d challenging the\n\n        federal government\u2019s prosecutorial decisions, 599 U.S. at 678, its discussion\n\n        of the insufficiency of the states\u2019 indirect harms was plainly not limited to\n\n        that context, see id. at 680 n.3. And in any event, the states here also\n\n        challenge a \u201ccore Executive Branch function[],\u201d JA928\u2014the federal\n\n        government\u2019s management of its own workforce, see Sampson v. Murray,\n\n        415 U.S. 61, 83 (1974). The district court did not identify any cases\n\n        establishing that federal courts have \u201ctraditionally entertained lawsuits of\n\n        this kind\u201d brought by states alleging downstream harms to their budgets\n\n        and resources as a result of the federal government\u2019s employment\n\n        decisions. See Texas, 599 U.S. at 678. Rather, those actions would\n\n        traditionally be challenged, if at all, by affected employees. See infra pp.\n\n        29-35.\n\n              2.    The district court\u2019s attempt to repackage the states\u2019 alleged\n\n        injuries as \u201cinformational,\u201d JA916, does not rehabilitate the states\u2019 flawed\n\n\n                                              24\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248    Doc: 58       Filed: 04/16/2025   Pg: 32 of 56\n\n\n\n\n        theory. The district court understood the states\u2019 asserted harms to \u201cboil[]\n\n        down\u201d to just one injury: an \u201cinformational harm\u201d from the government\u2019s\n\n        alleged failure to provide states notice of its terminations, which the district\n\n        court believed would be redressed by an order of reinstatement. JA916,\n\n        JA933-934. That fails in every respect.\n\n              As the district court correctly recognized, see JA924, informational\n\n        injury does not by itself create Article III standing. See TransUnion LLC v.\n\n        Ramirez, 594 U.S. 413, 426 (2021). Instead, an asserted informational\n\n        injury must cause \u201creal\u201d harms that \u201care of the type that have traditionally\n\n        been regarded as providing a basis for a lawsuit in English or American\n\n        courts.\u201d Dreher, 856 F.3d at 345 (quotation marks omitted). Here, the\n\n        only harms the district court identified are the purported harms to state\n\n        resources discussed above, which cannot suffice. See, e.g., JA917-918\n\n        (emphasizing burdens on state \u201csocial-service programs,\u201d loss of \u201cincome-\n\n        tax revenue,\u201d and an increase in \u201cunemployment benefits applications\u201d).\n\n              In any event, the district court\u2019s reinstatement order does not redress\n\n        any \u201cinformational\u201d injury. A plaintiff seeking injunctive relief on a theory\n\n        of informational injury asserts that a judicial order would lead him to\n\n        obtain information he lacks\u2014\u201c[a]s when an agency denies requests for\n\n        information under the Freedom of Information Act.\u201d Public Citizen v. U.S.\n\n\n                                               25\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 58       Filed: 04/16/2025   Pg: 33 of 56\n\n\n\n\n        Dep\u2019t of Justice, 491 U.S. 440, 449 (1989); see also, e.g., Federal Election\n\n        Comm\u2019n v. Akins, 524 U.S. 11, 21 (1998) (\u201cThe \u2018injury in fact\u2019 that\n\n        respondents have suffered consists of their inability to obtain information\n\n        \u2026 that, on respondents\u2019 view of the law, the statute requires [the\n\n        committee] make public.\u201d); Laufer v. Naranda Hotels, LLC, 60 F.4th 156,\n\n        171 (4th Cir. 2023) (disabled plaintiff sought injunction requiring hotel to\n\n        provide information about accessible rooms). Here, at least as to\n\n        terminations that have already occurred, the states do not allege that any\n\n        information is now being withheld from them. Any informational injury no\n\n        longer exists and could not possibly be grounds for the district court\u2019s\n\n        sweeping reinstatement order.\n\n              The district court nevertheless suggested that its reinstatement\n\n        remedy was \u201csufficient and necessary to redress the overarching\n\n        informational injury\u201d because the \u201cdownstream harms stem from the\n\n        increased pressure on state programs,\u201d and \u201can adequate remedy is one\n\n        that relieves that pressure.\u201d JA934. Yet neither the district court nor the\n\n        states has cited any authority suggesting that an informational injury\n\n        remains redressable even after the plaintiff has obtained all the information\n\n        it claimed was missing, so long as the plaintiff experiences some follow-on\n\n        consequential injury. Nor may courts grant relief for a supposed\n\n\n                                              26\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248    Doc: 58      Filed: 04/16/2025   Pg: 34 of 56\n\n\n\n\n        \u201cinformational injury\u201d that goes far beyond redressing the lack of\n\n        information itself. Indeed, lawsuits involving \u201cinformational\u201d injuries\n\n        typically come to an end when the plaintiff obtains the information sought.\n\n        See, e.g., Regional Mgmt. Corp. v. Legal Servs. Corp., 186 F.3d 457, 465\n\n        (4th Cir. 1999) (explaining that \u201ca challenge to a particular denial of a\n\n        [Freedom of Information Act] request becomes moot if an agency produces\n\n        the requested documents\u201d); Misegades & Douglas v. Schuyler, 456 F.2d\n\n        255, 256 (4th Cir. 1972) (per curiam) (\u201cSince appellant has been provided\n\n        with the document, there is no longer any matter in controversy before this\n\n        court.\u201d). The mismatch between the states\u2019 informational injury theory and\n\n        the district court\u2019s order is further underscored by the fact that, under the\n\n        states\u2019 own theory, they are entitled to at most 60 days\u2019 notice, but the\n\n        district court\u2019s order of indefinite reinstatement was untethered to even\n\n        that timeline.\n\n              Thus, even if the district court were correct that it had the equitable\n\n        power to order indefinite reinstatement of wrongfully terminated\n\n        employees\u2014and it isn\u2019t, see, e.g., Sampson, 415 U.S. at 83\u2014such relief was\n\n        plainly improper here on the states\u2019 asserted informational harms.\n\n\n\n\n                                              27\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248    Doc: 58       Filed: 04/16/2025   Pg: 35 of 56\n\n\n\n\n              B.    Federal Personnel Statutes Divest District Courts\n                    Of Subject-Matter Jurisdiction To Consider\n                    Claims Concerning The Termination Of Federal\n                    Employees.\n\n              Even if the states had Article III standing, the district court would still\n\n        lack jurisdiction over their claims because Congress has \u201cestablished a\n\n        comprehensive system\u201d that provides the \u201cexclusive means\u201d for reviewing\n\n        challenges to the employment decisions of federal agencies. Elgin v.\n\n        Department of the Treasury, 567 U.S. 1, 5, 8 (2012) (quotation marks\n\n        omitted).\n\n              1.    The CSRA, including the FSLMRS, \u201ccreates an integrated\n\n        scheme of administrative and judicial review, wherein the Congress\n\n        intentionally provided\u2014and intentionally chose not to provide\u2014particular\n\n        forums and procedures for particular kinds of claims.\u201d AFGE v. Secretary\n\n        of the Air Force, 716 F.3d 633, 636 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (alterations, citation,\n\n        and quotations marks omitted). Congress allowed certain individual\n\n        federal employees who are affected by agency personnel decisions to\n\n        challenge those decisions \u201cby litigating their claims through the statutory\n\n        scheme in the context of [a] concrete\u201d dispute, with limitations imposed by\n\n        Congress on the kinds of claims and remedies available. See AFGE v.\n\n        Trump, 929 F.3d 748, 757 (D.C. Cir. 2019). The purpose of this statute was\n\n        to \u201creplace the haphazard arrangements for administrative and judicial\n\n                                               28\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 58       Filed: 04/16/2025   Pg: 36 of 56\n\n\n\n\n        review of personnel action, part of the outdated patchwork of statutes and\n\n        rules built up over almost a century that was the civil service system.\u201d\n\n        United States v. Fausto, 484 U.S. 439, 444 (1988) (quotation marks\n\n        omitted).\n\n              2.    The district court never disputed that if this lawsuit were\n\n        brought by the real parties in interest\u2014terminated probationary\n\n        employees\u2014it could proceed only through the scheme enacted by Congress.\n\n        See, e.g., JA941 (court agreeing that \u201cthe CSRA offers a limited review\n\n        scheme\u201d for \u201csuit[s] brought by employees or unions\u201d). Yet the district\n\n        court concluded that those statutory limitations are irrelevant here because\n\n        states are not entitled to seek administrative or judicial review under the\n\n        CSRA. JA941.\n\n              That gets it exactly backwards. Even if the states are excluded from\n\n        the CSRA process, that does not turn the states into favored plaintiffs who\n\n        can challenge the federal government\u2019s termination decisions directly in\n\n        district court, without any of the limitations that would apply if the real\n\n        parties in interest were to bring suit. To the contrary, when a\n\n        comprehensive remedial scheme permits only some plaintiffs to seek\n\n        review, the scheme implicitly precludes judicial review by other plaintiffs\n\n        (here, the states) who are not authorized to bring claims.\n\n\n                                              29\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 58       Filed: 04/16/2025   Pg: 37 of 56\n\n\n\n\n              The Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized this fundamental\n\n        principle. In Block v. Community Nutrition Institute, 467 U.S. 340, 347\n\n        (1984), the Supreme Court considered a statute that permitted dairy\n\n        handlers to obtain review of certain \u201cmarket orders\u201d after exhausting\n\n        administrative remedies but did not authorize review by anyone else. See\n\n        id. at 346 (citing 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 608c). When a group of dairy consumers\n\n        sought review of a marketing order, the Supreme Court explained that the\n\n        statute omits a \u201cprovision for participation by consumers in any\n\n        proceeding.\u201d Id. at 347. In the \u201ccomplex scheme\u201d Congress had provided,\n\n        \u201cthe omission of such a provision is sufficient reason to believe that\n\n        Congress intended to foreclose consumer participation in the regulatory\n\n        process.\u201d Id. Accordingly, the Court explained, the statute\u2019s \u201cstructure \u2026\n\n        indicates that Congress intended only producers and handlers, and not\n\n        consumers, to ensure that the statutory objectives would be realized.\u201d Id.\n\n        And the \u201crestriction of the administrative remedy to handlers strongly\n\n        suggests that Congress intended a similar restriction of judicial review of\n\n        market orders.\u201d Id. Any other result, the Court said, would facilitate\n\n        circumvention of the comprehensive statutory scheme. See id. at 348.\n\n              Not long after Block, the Supreme Court applied the same reasoning\n\n        to the CSRA itself. In Fausto, the Court again explained that the\n\n\n                                              30\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248    Doc: 58       Filed: 04/16/2025   Pg: 38 of 56\n\n\n\n\n        \u201cexclusion\u201d of a party \u201cfrom the provisions establishing administrative and\n\n        judicial review for personnel action\u201d of the type challenged here \u201cprevents\n\n        [the party] from seeking review\u201d under other provisions. 484 U.S. at 455\n\n        (emphasis added). There, a federal employee who lacked any \u201cright to\n\n        administrative or judicial review\u201d under the CSRA challenged his\n\n        suspension in federal claims court under the Back Pay Act. See id. at 440,\n\n        443. The Supreme Court explained that Congress\u2019s choice to \u201cwithhold[]\u201d a\n\n        remedy under the CSRA \u201cpreclude[d] judicial review\u201d for that employee\u2014it\n\n        did not \u201cleave [the employee] free to pursue\u201d different remedies in a\n\n        different forum. Id. at 443-44, 448-49. The Court emphasized that the\n\n        CSRA\u2019s \u201ccomprehensive nature,\u201d its express provisions for different kinds\n\n        of review for different kinds of plaintiffs, and its exclusion of those in the\n\n        plaintiffs\u2019 position from the comprehensive scheme, reflected a \u201cconsidered\n\n        congressional judgment\u201d that those employees \u201cshould not have statutory\n\n        entitlement to review for\u201d that type of personnel action covered by the\n\n        CSRA. Id. at 448-49; see Grosdidier v. Chairman, Broad. Bd. of\n\n        Governors, 560 F.3d 495, 497 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (Kavanaugh, J.) (\u201c[T]he\n\n        CSRA is the exclusive avenue for suit even if the plaintiff cannot prevail in a\n\n        claim under the CSRA.\u201d).\n\n\n\n\n                                               31\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248    Doc: 58       Filed: 04/16/2025   Pg: 39 of 56\n\n\n\n\n              Those principles likewise foreclose the district court\u2019s exercise of\n\n        subject-matter jurisdiction here. Just as Congress \u201cintentionally foreclosed\n\n        judicial review to\u201d certain employees under the CSRA, see Pinar v. Dole,\n\n        747 F.2d 899, 912 (4th Cir. 1984), it intentionally foreclosed judicial review\n\n        by parties other than those whom it specifically authorized to seek relief.\n\n        As in Fausto, it would turn the CSRA\u2019s comprehensive structure \u201cupside\n\n        down\u201d for states who are strangers to the federal government\u2019s employment\n\n        relationships to challenge the terminations of probationary employees in\n\n        federal district court, \u201cfree\u201d from any of the restrictions that would apply if\n\n        the claim were brought by the terminated employees themselves. See 484\n\n        U.S. at 449-50. The exclusion of states from the CSRA\u2019s review scheme\n\n        reflects Congress\u2019s considered judgment limiting who may challenge a\n\n        personnel decision and on what grounds\u2014rather than providing carte\n\n        blanche for states to sue outside the CSRA\u2019s comprehensive scheme. See\n\n        Graham v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d 931, 935 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (Roberts, J.) (\u201c[I]t\n\n        is the comprehensiveness of the statutory scheme involved, not the\n\n        \u2018adequacy\u2019 of the specific remedies\u201d that precludes jurisdiction. (quoting\n\n        Spagnola v. Mathis, 859 F.2d 223, 227 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (en banc) (per\n\n        curiam))).\n\n\n\n\n                                               32\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248    Doc: 58       Filed: 04/16/2025   Pg: 40 of 56\n\n\n\n\n              Contrary to the district court\u2019s suggestion (JA942-944), the Supreme\n\n        Court\u2019s more recent decisions in Thunder Basin Coal Co. v. Reich, 510 U.S.\n\n        200 (1994), and Axon Enterprise, Inc. v. FTC, 598 U.S. 175, 186 (2023),\n\n        reflect these same principles, and the analysis above readily maps onto the\n\n        frameworks they distill. Those cases underscore that where, as here,\n\n        Congress has established a \u201ccomprehensive\u201d review scheme, district courts\n\n        lack subject-matter jurisdiction over a claim that is, as here, \u201cof the type\n\n        Congress intended to be reviewed within\u201d the statutory structure. See id.\n\n        (quoting Thunder Basin, 510 U.S. at 208, 212); see also Elgin, 567 U.S. at\n\n        12-14 (reaffirming that the CSRA establishes an \u201cintegrated scheme of\n\n        administrative and judicial review\u201d for challenges to federal employment\n\n        actions (quoting Fausto, 484 U.S. at 445)).\n\n              The district court erred in concluding that the states\u2019 claim falls\n\n        outside the CSRA because it is \u201cfundamentally different\u201d from those that\n\n        employees may bring under the CSRA. JA939-940, 943. The states\u2019 claim,\n\n        \u201cat bottom,\u201d rests on allegations that the government unlawfully terminated\n\n        probationary employees. Federal Law Enf\u2019t Officers Ass\u2019n v. Ahuja, 62\n\n        F.4th 551, 563 (D.C. Cir. 2023) (quoting Heckler v. Ringer, 466 U.S. 602,\n\n        614 (1984)). The states specifically allege that the terminations were\n\n        \u201cagainst the law,\u201d JA29, and the states dispute\u2014as \u201cpretext\u201d\u2014agencies\u2019\n\n\n                                               33\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248    Doc: 58      Filed: 04/16/2025   Pg: 41 of 56\n\n\n\n\n        stated reasons for terminating probationary employees, Dkt. No. 78-1, at 4,\n\n        10. Moreover, the states sought\u2014and the district court granted\u2014\n\n        reinstatement of terminated employees. JA982 (granting relief to\n\n        \u201creturn[]\u201d individuals \u201cto the Government\u2019s employ\u201d). The states\u2019 claim\n\n        thus falls in the heartland of challenges that Congress wanted only the\n\n        MSPB (and, eventually, the Federal Circuit and Supreme Court) to resolve.\n\n        See supra pp. 8-10, 31-32. Indeed, some terminated employees are\n\n        invoking the CSRA to seek exactly that relief on the same theory that the\n\n        states advance here. See, e.g., U.S. Office of Special Counsel\u2019s Initial\n\n        Request for Stay of Personnel Actions at 10-15, U.S. Office of Special\n\n        Counsel ex rel. Doe v. Department of Agric., No. CB-1208-25-0020-U-1\n\n        (M.S.P.B. Feb. 28, 2025) (alleging that terminations of probationary\n\n        employees unlawfully failed to follow RIF procedures).\n\n              The district court was therefore plainly incorrect in concluding that\n\n        there is no \u201cidentity of interests between the States and the fired\n\n        employees,\u201d where the states challenge the terminations as unlawful and\n\n        seek to have those employees reinstated. JA944. If the district court were\n\n        correct that the states\u2019 interests diverge from the terminated employees\u2019\n\n        interests, that would only make all the more apparent the impropriety of\n\n        permitting the states to seek relief on the terminated employees\u2019 behalf,\n\n\n                                              34\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 58       Filed: 04/16/2025   Pg: 42 of 56\n\n\n\n\n        where no employee is a party to this suit. Cf., e.g., Broussard v. Meineke\n\n        Disc. Muffler Shops, Inc., 155 F.3d 331, 338 (4th Cir. 1998) (in class action\n\n        context, \u201cbasic due process requires that named plaintiffs possess\n\n        undivided loyalties to absent class members\u201d).\n\n              In short, Congress did not establish an implausible scheme in which\n\n        employees must litigate their terminations through a comprehensive,\n\n        integrated scheme, but states are left free to challenge those same\n\n        employment actions directly in federal district court with \u201cgreater rights\u201d\n\n        than the affected employees themselves. See Graham, 358 F.3d at 934.\n\n        That scheme would allow states to \u201cbypass\u201d the reticulated statutory\n\n        scheme Congress established \u201cand thereby deprive the Government of the\n\n        opportunity to work out its personnel problems within the framework it has\n\n        so painstakingly established.\u201d Pinar, 747 F.2d at 913 (quotation marks\n\n        omitted). And it would risk conflicting decisions concerning the same\n\n        personnel actions, recreating the very \u201chaphazard\u201d \u201cpatchwork\u201d that\n\n        Congress enacted the CSRA to avoid. See Fausto, 484 U.S. at 444-45.\n\n        Instead, Congress limited review of federal employment actions to actions\n\n        by affected employees themselves, in a different forum. And as then-Judge\n\n        Roberts summed up, \u201cwhat you get under the CSRA is what you get.\u201d\n\n        Fornaro v. James, 416 F.3d 63, 67 (D.C. Cir. 2005).\n\n\n                                              35\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248     Doc: 58      Filed: 04/16/2025   Pg: 43 of 56\n\n\n\n\n        II.     The Government Did Not Conduct A Reduction In\n                Force.\n\n                The motions panel was correct to conclude that the district court\n\n        likely \u201clacked jurisdiction over Plaintiffs\u2019 claims.\u201d Stay Order 5. That alone\n\n        suffices to vacate the injunction. But the district court\u2019s merits analysis is\n\n        no sounder. The essential premise of the district court\u2019s order\u2014that\n\n        agencies\u2019 terminations of probationary employees amounted to an\n\n        unannounced RIF\u2014is wrong. The district court emphasized that \u201c[n]early\n\n        every termination letter in the record reflects that the terminations purport\n\n        to be for-cause.\u201d JA948. But the court doubted that sufficient cause\n\n        existed to terminate probationary employees. JA951. Even if the district\n\n        court were correct, however, that sufficient cause did not exist for any\n\n        particular employee, that would be a claim that affected employees may\n\n        pursue\u2014and are pursuing\u2014through the procedures created by the CSRA. It\n\n        would not mean the government has conducted unannounced unlawful\n\n        RIFs.\n\n                \u201cA RIF is not an adverse action against a particular employee\u201d but is\n\n        rather \u201can administrative procedure by which agencies eliminate jobs and\n\n        reassign or separate employees who occupied the abolished positions.\u201d\n\n        James v. Von Zemenszky, 284 F.3d 1310, 1314 (Fed. Cir. 2002). Reflecting\n\n        this difference, the regulations governing RIFs focus on the \u201cpositions\u201d that\n\n                                               36\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 58       Filed: 04/16/2025   Pg: 44 of 56\n\n\n\n\n        are to be filled, abolished, or vacated\u2014not the specific employees. 5 C.F.R.\n\n        \u00a7 351.201(a)(1). When an agency \u201cformally announce[s] a reduction in\n\n        force,\u201d it may take action to release employees \u201cbecause of lack of work;\n\n        shortage of funds; insufficient personnel ceiling; reorganization; the\n\n        exercise of reemployment rights or restoration rights; or reclassification of\n\n        an employee\u2019s position d[u]e to erosion of duties,\u201d subject to requirements\n\n        in which employees compete for continued employment based on their\n\n        seniority level, veteran status, and performance history. See generally id.\n\n        \u00a7\u00a7 351.201(a), 351.501.\n\n              The district court reasoned that, because a large number of\n\n        probationary employees were terminated, the terminations must have been\n\n        \u201cessentially reorganizations\u201d that amounted to a RIF. JA950. But under\n\n        the regulations, a reorganization is \u201cthe planned elimination, addition, or\n\n        redistribution of functions or duties in an organization,\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.203\n\n        (emphasis added). The court identified no record evidence that any agency\n\n        had eliminated functions or duties, nor did it find that any \u201cpositions\u201d (as\n\n        distinct from employees) had been eliminated. Instead, the district court\n\n        simply stated that because the government\u2019s efforts were \u201caimed at a\n\n        reduction in probationers across the board,\u201d JA953, it must have actually\n\n        conducted a RIF.\n\n\n                                              37\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 58       Filed: 04/16/2025   Pg: 45 of 56\n\n\n\n\n              The district court erred by concluding that the states would likely\n\n        succeed in showing that the government illegally conducted a RIF, even\n\n        though the states failed to carry their burden of supplying evidence that any\n\n        positions were actually eliminated or any agency functions or duties were\n\n        actually changed. See Winter v. NRDC, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008).\n\n        Accordingly, should the Court reach the merits, those errors independently\n\n        support reversal.\n\n        III. The States Failed To Establish The Other Preliminary-\n             Injunction Factors.\n\n              The district court likewise erred in concluding that the remaining\n\n        equitable factors favored a preliminary injunction. As discussed above, the\n\n        states\u2019 allegations of downstream economic effects do not establish an\n\n        injury-in-fact, let alone amount to irreparable harm. See supra pp. 21-27.\n\n        Nor, in any event, do those downstream harms outweigh the significant\n\n        harms the injunction inflicts on the government and the public interest,\n\n        which \u201cmerge\u201d here. See Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009).\n\n              Across the government, agencies have determined that the continued\n\n        employment of certain employees is unnecessary and inconsistent with\n\n        those agencies\u2019 missions. It obviously disserves the government to require\n\n        it to continue employing individuals whose services it no longer needs, for\n\n        the government has \u201ctraditionally been granted the widest latitude in the\n\n                                              38\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248    Doc: 58        Filed: 04/16/2025   Pg: 46 of 56\n\n\n\n\n        \u2018dispatch of its own internal affairs.\u2019\u201d Sampson, 415 U.S. at 83. And on a\n\n        practical level, the government \u201cis unlikely to recover the [taxpayer] funds\n\n        disbursed to reinstated probationary employees,\u201d even if the government\n\n        eventually wins this case. See Stay Order 5; JA988 (acknowledging this\n\n        irreparable harm). That harm could theoretically have been addressed by a\n\n        bond under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(c), but the district court\n\n        further abused its discretion by setting the amount of the bond at a nominal\n\n        $100 per plaintiff state, JA987-989\u2014which is plainly inadequate to protect\n\n        the government from the losses that it is incurring while the district court\u2019s\n\n        order is in effect. Finally, the district court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction, despite\n\n        the exclusive administrative process for handling federal employment\n\n        matters, has an ongoing \u201cdisruptive effect on the administrative processes\n\n        established by the government to handle cases such as these.\u201d Garcia v.\n\n        United States, 680 F.2d 29, 32 (5th Cir. 1982).\n\n              The motions panel\u2019s grant of a stay pending appeal underscores the\n\n        conclusion that the equities tilt sharply in the government\u2019s favor. The\n\n        motions panel balanced plaintiffs\u2019 asserted harms against the government\u2019s\n\n        harms and the public interest and determined that a stay was warranted.\n\n        See Stay Order 4-5 (citing Nken, 556 U.S. at 426, and recognizing that the\n\n        government had satisfied the stay factors). That is consistent with a similar\n\n\n                                                39\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248    Doc: 58          Filed: 04/16/2025   Pg: 47 of 56\n\n\n\n\n        decision reached by the Supreme Court in OPM v.

In granting a stay of\n\n        that injunction, which required the reinstatement of terminated\n\n        probationary employees at six agencies, the Supreme Court necessarily\n\n        concluded that that injunction irreparably harmed the government. See\n\n        Hollingsworth v. Perry, 558 U.S. 183, 190 (2010) (per curiam) (\u201cTo obtain\n\n        a stay pending the filing and disposition of a petition for a writ of certiorari,\n\n        an applicant must show \u2026 a likelihood that irreparable harm will result\n\n        from the denial of a stay.\u201d). For the same reasons the balance of equities\n\n        justify a stay pending appeal, the district court\u2019s injunction never should\n\n        have issued in the first place.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  40\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 58       Filed: 04/16/2025   Pg: 48 of 56\n\n\n\n\n                                      CONCLUSION\n\n              For the foregoing reasons, this Court should vacate the district court\u2019s\n\n        preliminary injunction.\n\n                                                   Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                                   YAAKOV M.

Attach additional page if necessary.)\n         Plaintiffs are nineteen states and the District of Columbia. Plaintiffs have sued twenty-one\n         federal agencies, alleging that those agencies' terminations of certain probationary federal\n         employees amounted to a reduction in force of which the plaintiff jurisdictions were entitled to\n         advance notice. On April 1, 2025, the district court entered an order requiring the\n         reinstatement of thousands of employees at nearly all of those agencies.\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248         Doc: 53            Filed: 04/11/2025         Pg: 3 of 6\n\n\n\n\n         Issues (Non-binding statement of issues on appeal. Attach additional page if necessary)\n\n         The issues on appeal will include whether the plaintiffs had Article III standing, whether the\n         district court was divested of jurisdiciton pursuant to the Civil Service Reform Act and the\n         Federal Service-Labor Management Relations Statute, whether the plaintiffs were likely to\n         suceed on the merits of their claims, and whether the equitable factors otherwise supported\n         preliminary relief.\n\n\n\n\n         Adverse Parties (List adverse parties to this appeal and their attorneys; provide party=s address if the\n         party is not represented by counsel.

As far as the Appellee States are aware, the sweep\n\n        of that unannounced purge was unparalleled in modern history. The States were left\n\n        to pick up the pieces of the shattered federal workforce\u2014addressing numerous\n\n        unemployment compensation requests, hunting for information about newly jobless\n\n        residents, and helping our citizens seek employment as each new wave of\n\n        terminations crested. As the district court found in a careful 85-page decision based\n\n        on extensive record evidence, these mass firings were reductions in force (\u201cRIFs\u201d)\n\n        aimed to cut costs and reorganize agencies. Yet the Agencies flagrantly violated the\n\n        comprehensive statutory and regulatory commands that govern RIFs. Specifically,\n\n        Congress requires the Agencies to notify the States 60 days in advance of a RIF.\n\n        Here, the Agencies ignored that clear mandate and harmed the States in the process.\n\n              Recognizing this reality, the district court promptly restored the status quo\n\n        ante by enjoining the Agencies from continuing the mass firings and reinstating only\n\n        those terminated employees whose duty station or residence is in one of the States.\n\n        The injunction does not prevent the Agencies from terminating employees for\n\n        individualized cause or from conducting future RIFs, provided that they give the\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248     Doc: 51        Filed: 04/10/2025    Pg: 4 of 131\n\n\n\n\n        required notice. Thus far, in compliance with the injunction, the Agencies have\n\n        reinstated nearly all of the thousands of terminated employees.\n\n              But yesterday, a divided panel of this Court stayed the preliminary injunction\n\n        with only one paragraph of reasoning and over a lengthy dissent. As a result, the\n\n        Agencies can immediately re-terminate tens of thousands of probationary\n\n        employees. The mass layoffs would again inundate the States with a wave of\n\n        unemployed residents, amplifying the harms that engendered this suit. The full\n\n        Court should vacate the panel majority\u2019s order and leave in place the district court\u2019s\n\n        carefully crafted preliminary injunction as this case is resolved on an expedited\n\n        briefing schedule. While the Court considers this request, the States ask for an\n\n        immediate administrative stay of the panel\u2019s decision.\n\n              En banc review is appropriate because the stay order conflicts with binding\n\n        precedent and involves a question of exceptional importance. First, the panel\n\n        majority\u2019s holding that the district court likely lacked jurisdiction over the States\u2019\n\n        claims conflicts with Supreme Court and Fourth Circuit precedent. See, e.g., Fed.\n\n        Election Comm\u2019n v. Akins, 524 U.S. 11 (1998); Dreher v. Experian Info. Solutions,\n\n        Inc., 856 F.3d 337 (4th Cir. 2017). Its determination that the States lack standing to\n\n        vindicate concrete, pocketbook harms caused by the deprivation of information\n\n        contravenes black-letter law. The sole support for the panel decision was one\n\n        inapposite, unpublished Supreme Court order in a case concerning different kinds of\n\n                                                  2\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248      Doc: 51       Filed: 04/10/2025    Pg: 5 of 131\n\n\n\n\n        plaintiffs (nonprofits) suing under a vastly different theory of harm. And to the\n\n        extent the majority also found that the States\u2019 claims should be administratively\n\n        channeled, that conclusion fails the well-established Thunder Basin test, which\n\n        defines the limited circumstances in which plaintiffs must pursue administrative\n\n        adjudication. See Thunder Basin Coal Co. v. Reich, 510 U.S. 200 (1994). Moreover,\n\n        such a determination would make this Court the first in the country to hold that the\n\n        Civil Service Reform Act (\u201cCSRA\u201d) precludes non-union, non-employee plaintiffs,\n\n        like the States, from review in any forum for a clear statutory violation.\n\n              Second, the question at the core of this dispute is also exceptionally important:\n\n        Whether the Agencies can once again terminate more than 24,000 probationary\n\n        employees, in contravention of the express statutory protections Congress provided\n\n        to the States. Specifically, the question is whether the Agencies can do so while this\n\n        appeal is pending and being briefed on an expedited basis. In balancing the parties\u2019\n\n        harms, the majority considered only that \u201cthe Government is unlikely to recover the\n\n        funds disbursed to reinstated probationary employees.\u201d Dkt. 42 at 5. But the law\n\n        requires an agency to continue employing its personnel while conducting a proper\n\n        RIF. So, the only cost imposed on the Agencies is the cost of following the law.\n\n        And the panel majority did not mention the massive and unrecoverable costs the\n\n        States will incur pending final judgment. Accordingly, swift intervention of the full\n\n        Court is needed.\n\n                                                  3\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248     Doc: 51        Filed: 04/10/2025    Pg: 6 of 131\n\n\n\n\n                                    STATEMENT OF THE CASE\n              Legal Framework\n\n              New federal employees and others who have changed offices or received\n\n        promotions are subject to probationary periods. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7511(a)(1); 5 C.F.R.\n\n        \u00a7 315.801.

On Inauguration Day, the\n\n        Office of Personnel Management (\u201cOPM\u201d) directed agency heads to \u201cidentify all\n\n        employees on probationary periods\u201d and \u201cpromptly determine whether those\n\n        employees should be retained.\u201d Mem. from Charles Ezell to Heads & Acting Heads\n\n        of Dep\u2019ts & Agencies 1 (Jan. 20, 2025), tinyurl.com/y4cjp5wh. Less than a month\n\n        later, OPM ordered the mass termination of probationary employees. The Agencies\n\n\n                                                  5\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248     Doc: 51        Filed: 04/10/2025    Pg: 8 of 131\n\n\n\n\n        obeyed, firing over 24,000 employees. (ECF 1, Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 102-40; ECF 33-2,\n\n        Redacted Decl. \u00b6 5; DiMartini Decl. \u00b6 13.) Each termination occurred without notice\n\n        to the States. These terminations were RIFs and were not based on individualized\n\n        for-cause findings. As a former OPM Director explained, it is \u201cnot possible . . . for\n\n        so many federal agencies to have independently and simultaneously decided to\n\n        terminate large numbers of their workers,\u201d or \u201cto have done proper assessments of\n\n        all these employees.\u201d (ECF 78-9, Archuleta Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 12-13.)\n\n              In the wake of these mass terminations, many States have seen significant\n\n        increases in the number of unemployment claims filed by former federal\n\n        employees\u2014up several hundred percent relative to the same period last year. (See,\n\n        e.g., ECF 4-5, Maryland Labor Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 50, 52 (330% increase); ECF 4-11, New\n\n        Jersey Labor Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 14-15 (273%); ECF 4-7, California Employment Decl. \u00b6 30\n\n        (149%).) To fulfill their rapid response duties, the States have had to devote\n\n        significant resources to affirmatively contact the Agencies, monitor public reporting,\n\n        and conduct mass outreach to identify impacted workers. (See, e.g., ECF 4-5,\n\n        Maryland Labor Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 16, 19-23; ECF 4-11, New Jersey Labor Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 16 -18.)\n\n        Some States diverted staff from pressing projects to retrain them to provide rapid\n\n        response services. (See, e.g., ECF 4-5, Maryland Labor Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 24-28.) Others\n\n        created new websites or set up dedicated phone lines. (See, e.g., ECF 4-5, Maryland\n\n        Labor Decl. \u00b6 29; ECF 4-8, Illinois Employment Decl. \u00b6 32; ECF 4-7, California\n\n                                                  6\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248     Doc: 51        Filed: 04/10/2025     Pg: 9 of 131\n\n\n\n\n        Employment Decl. \u00b6 19.)        The States still do not know exactly how many\n\n        probationary employees were terminated in each geographic area, or by what agency\n\n        those employees were terminated.\n\n              Procedural History\n\n              On March 6, 2025, the States sued to challenge the mass termination of\n\n        probationary employees without proper notice. The States requested that the district\n\n        court temporarily restrain further unlawful terminations of probationary employees\n\n        and preserve the status quo ante (ECF 4-1, at 3\u20114.) The district court issued a\n\n        temporary restraining order (\u201cTRO\u201d) on a nationwide basis as to all but three\n\n        defendants. On March 25, the Agencies represented having \u201cachieved substantial\n\n        compliance\u201d with the TRO. (ECF 103, at 3.)\n\n              On April 1, the district court granted the States\u2019 preliminary injunction motion\n\n        with respect to all but one defendant. It narrowed the relief to apply only \u201cto\n\n        employees who live or work in Plaintiff States.\u201d (ECF 125, at 70.) The injunction\n\n        does not prevent the Agencies from terminating employees for individualized cause\n\n        or from conducting future RIFs, provided that they follow lawful procedures and\n\n        notify the States. (ECF 126 \u00b6 3.)\n\n              On April 9, over the dissent of Judge Benjamin, a panel of this Court stayed\n\n        the district court\u2019s preliminary injunction at the request of the Agencies. The panel\n\n        majority justified its decision with a single paragraph of legal reasoning. It explained\n\n\n                                                   7\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248     Doc: 51        Filed: 04/10/2025       Pg: 10 of 131\n\n\n\n\n        only that the Agencies are \u201clikely to succeed in showing the district court lacked\n\n        jurisdiction over Plaintiffs\u2019 claims\u201d and are \u201cunlikely to recover the funds disbursed\n\n        to reinstated probationary employees.\u201d Dkt. 42 at 5. The States immediately moved\n\n        to administratively stay that decision pending rehearing en banc; the panel denied\n\n        that relief, again over Judge Benjamin\u2019s dissent. Dkt. 48.\n\n                     REASONS FOR GRANTING REHEARING EN BANC\n\n        I.    THE PANEL MAJORITY\u2019S JURISDICTIONAL DETERMINATION CONFLICTS\n              WITH SUPREME COURT AND FOURTH CIRCUIT PRECEDENT.\n\n              The panel majority\u2019s conclusion that the district court lacked jurisdiction\n\n        conflicts with clear precedent from this Court and the Supreme Court. For that\n\n        reason alone, the full Court\u2019s intervention is needed.\n\n              A.     The States Have Standing.\n\n              As Judge Benjamin observed, under binding precedent, \u201cthe States clearly\n\n        have standing.\u201d Dkt. 42 at 6 (Benjamin, J., dissenting) (footnote omitted). Indeed,\n\n        the district court spent nearly 20 pages meticulously outlining the basis for the\n\n        States\u2019 standing, detailing ample evidence of concrete harms. (ECF 125, at 8-29.)\n\n        Following Fourth Circuit and Supreme Court precedent, the district court concluded\n\n        that the States\u2019 informational injury is cognizable under Article III. The panel\n\n        majority was wrong to conclude otherwise, and, in doing so, ran afoul of binding\n\n        precedent.\n\n\n\n                                                  8\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248      Doc: 51         Filed: 04/10/2025      Pg: 11 of 131\n\n\n\n\n               To establish standing, a State must show \u201c(i) that [it] has suffered or likely\n\n        will suffer an injury in fact, (ii) that the injury likely was caused . . . by the defendant,\n\n        and (iii) that the injury likely would be redressed by the requested judicial relief.\u201d\n\n        FDA v. Alliance for Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. 367, 380 (2024). An informational\n\n        injury constitutes an Article III injury when there is a \u201clack [of] access to information\n\n        to which [one] is legally entitled\u201d and \u201cthe denial of that information creates a \u2018real\u2019\n\n        harm with an adverse effect.\u201d Dreher, Inc., 856 F.3d at 345 (citing Spokeo, Inc. v.\n\n        Robins, 578 U.S. 330, 340 (2016)); see also Akins, 524 U.S. at 24; Pub.

When assessing informational harm, this Court\n\n        and the Supreme Court \u201clook to a variety of sources,\u201d Dreher, 856 F.3d at 345,\n\n        including the \u201cjudgment of Congress,\u201d id. at 344 (quoting Spokeo, 578 U.S. at 340).\n\n               Here, the States asserted a direct injury based on the Agencies\u2019 failure to\n\n        provide certain information in advance of mass terminations, as required by the RIF\n\n        statutes and regulations. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d)(3); 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.801(b). That\n\n        clear statutory violation resulted in substantial pocketbook harms and resource\n\n        strains to the States, the record evidence of which is overwhelming. These harms\n\n        are \u201creal, [] not abstract.\u201d Spokeo, 578 U.S. at 340 (internal quotation marks\n\n        omitted).

(ECF 125, at 9-16.)\n\n              What is more, these are exactly the sort of harms Congress meant to forestall\n\n        by requiring warning to the States before an agency conducts mass terminations.\n\n        Accord Dreher, 856 F.3d at 345-46; Spokeo, 578 U.S. at 340-41.

Contra Dreher, 856 F.3d at 346\n\n        (concluding that the plaintiff alleged \u201ca statutory violation [of the FCRA] divorced\n\n        from any real world effect\u201d).\n\n              Yet the panel majority concluded that the Agencies are \u201clikely to succeed in\n\n        showing the district court lacked jurisdiction.\u201d Dkt. 42 at 5. To get there, the\n\n        majority did not wrestle with any of this Court\u2019s or the Supreme Court\u2019s\n\n        informational injury cases; rather, it cited to a brief Supreme Court order in a case\n\n                                                  10\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248     Doc: 51         Filed: 04/10/2025    Pg: 13 of 131\n\n\n\n\n        brought by a different class of plaintiffs (nonprofit organizations) concerning\n\n        different theories of harm (statutory versus non-statutory), incorrectly characterizing\n\n        that case as involving a \u201csimilar preliminary injunction.\u201d Dkt. 42 at 5 (citing OPM\n\n        v. AFGE, No. 24A904, 2025 WL 1035208, at *1 (U.S. Apr. 8, 2025) (Mem.)).\n\n        AFGE did involve the unlawful termination of probationary employees by the\n\n        federal government. But the similarities end there.\n\n              The only conceivable relevance of the Supreme Court\u2019s AFGE order is its\n\n        citation to Clapper v.

But here, the States\u2019 injuries are anything but speculative, and there is no\n\n        dispute that they resulted directly from the Agencies\u2019 violation of the statutory RIF\n\n        procedures.\n\n              The States were entitled not just to information, but specifically to advance\n\n        warning, the absence of which caused irreparable harm to the States.

Moreover, such a determination\n\n        would apparently make this Court the first in the country to hold that the CSRA\n\n        precludes non-union, non-employee plaintiffs from review for a clear statutory\n\n        violation.\n\n              Neither the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute nor the\n\n        CSRA precludes jurisdiction here. To establish preclusion, the Agencies must\n\n        satisfy Thunder Basin\u2019s two-step framework. 510 U.S. at 207, 212. Under that\n\n        framework, a court first asks \u201cwhether Congress\u2019s intent to preclude district-court\n\n        jurisdiction is fairly discernible in the statutory scheme.\u201d Bennett v.

Elgin v. Dep\u2019t of\n\n        Treasury, 567 U.S. 1, 10 (2012). The CSRA\u2019s administrative tribunals\u2014the Merit\n\n        Systems Protection Board and the Federal Labor Relations Authority\u2014are available\n\n        only to employees, unions, and employers, not to the States. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7103(a)(1)-\n\n        (2), 7123, 7703. Yet the States have clear statutory rights to notice, making it\n\n        illogical to conclude that Congress intended CSRA preclusion to encompass suits\n\n        like this one. See Koretoff v. Vilsack, 614 F.3d 532, 536 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (no\n\n        preclusion where Congress did not foreclose review to the \u201cclass\u201d to which the\n\n        plaintiff belongs).\n\n              Even if this Court were to proceed to step two, the CSRA still would not\n\n        preclude this suit. If the district court lacked jurisdiction, the States would be\n\n        deprived of any judicial review because they cannot access the relevant\n\n        administrative fora.

See, e.g., Dkt. 34 at 19-\n\n        21 (citing United States v. Fausto, 484 U.S. 439 (1988)). As Judge Benjamin\n\n        recognized, the States are not \u201ctrying to vindicate the interests of the terminated\n\n        workers.\u201d Dkt. 42 at 10 (Benjamin, J., dissenting) (quoting ECF 125, at 33). Rather,\n\n        the States suffer \u201ctheir own and separate harms as \u2018state[s] qua states,\u2019\u201d Dkt. 42 at\n\n        10 (Benjamin, J., dissenting) (quoting ECF 125, at 33)\u2014harms arising from the\n\n        Agencies\u2019 failure to provide statutorily mandated notice, which is not \u201cthe type of\n\n        personnel action covered by\u201d the CSRA, see Fausto, 484 U.S. at 448.\n\n              The panel majority offered no rationale supporting channeling, and any\n\n        determination to the contrary conflicts with Thunder Basin and the background\n\n        presumption of judicial review. That too warrants rehearing en banc.\n\n        II.   THE PANEL\u2019S ORDER RESOLVES                A    QUESTION     OF   EXCEPTIONAL\n              IMPORTANCE.\n\n              The Agencies\u2019 unannounced termination of more than 24,000 probationary\n\n        employees is unprecedented. The Agencies effectively claim the authority to fire\n\n        employees en masse based on shifting justifications and with no process, despite\n\n        clear statutory and regulatory commands to the contrary. (See ECF 101, at 16-20.)\n\n        That is not the law. Moreover, the panel majority erroneously concluded that the\n\n                                                 14\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248     Doc: 51        Filed: 04/10/2025    Pg: 17 of 131\n\n\n\n\n        equities tilt in the Agencies\u2019 favor based on the costs of employing personnel until\n\n        they can be properly terminated. But these expenses are imposed by the RIF statute\n\n        itself. The panel majority also ignored the mountain of harms befalling the States,\n\n        probationary employees, and the public interest. The panel\u2019s determination that the\n\n        Agencies may re-terminate more than 24,000 probationary employees while this\n\n        appeal proceeds on an expedited basis is exceptionally important and merits review.\n\n              As the district court found (ECF 125, at 38-62), the Agencies terminated\n\n        probationary employees through a series of massive RIFs but ignored the relevant\n\n        legal requirements, including the requirement to provide notice to the States. The\n\n        Agencies have never disputed that they are required to provide such notice to\n\n        conduct a RIF. Yet they failed to do so. Because the Agencies\u2019 legal violations are\n\n        clear and obvious, they have no likelihood of success on the merits, and the district\n\n        court was justified in entering a preliminary injunction. See CASA, Inc. v. Trump,\n\n        No. 25-1153, 2025 WL 654902, at *1-2 (4th Cir. Feb. 28, 2025).\n\n              The equities favor the States as well. The panel majority\u2019s stay invites the\n\n        Agencies to conduct another round of mass terminations, which have \u201ccause[d] real\n\n        harm with significant adverse effects\u201d for the States. Dkt. 42 at 8 (Benjamin, J.,\n\n        dissenting). These harms stem from the States\u2019 legal obligation under federal and\n\n        state law to provide rapid response services and furnish benefits to their residents in\n\n        the wake of mass terminations. States have no ability to avoid these costs, and the\n\n                                                  15\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248     Doc: 51        Filed: 04/10/2025    Pg: 18 of 131\n\n\n\n\n        Agencies have not argued otherwise. The stay will cause significant disruption,\n\n        reinstituting the same chaos that preceded the TRO. This havoc is especially\n\n        unwarranted since the panel has already scheduled argument on the preliminary\n\n        injunction for May 6. See Dkt. 44.\n\n              Each day that probationary employees are unemployed creates rising and\n\n        likely unrecoverable costs for the States, including \u201csubstantial . . . money damages\u201d\n\n        and the diversion of \u201cresources and personnel to accommodate the shifting\n\n        unemployment-response landscape.\u201d (ECF 125, at 63.) Another round of mass\n\n        terminations would compound these costs. The Agencies\u2019 suggestion below that\n\n        terminated employees could obtain back pay ignores the nature of this suit: Back\n\n        pay to employees alone would not redress injuries to the States. As the Agencies\n\n        themselves repeatedly argued, \u201cthe only way the States could be made whole was\n\n        by reinstatement.\u201d (ECF 125, at 65 (citing ECF 20, at 14, 17).)\n\n              Any harm to the Agencies pales in comparison, especially considering the\n\n        district court\u2019s tailored injunction. (See ECF 126, at \u00b6 8(b)(iii) (limiting relief to\n\n        probationary employees \u201c[w]hose duty station . . . and/or residence is in one of\u201d the\n\n        States).) The panel majority only cursorily addresses the Agencies\u2019 supposed harm\n\n        by noting that \u201cthe Government is unlikely to recover the funds disbursed to\n\n        reinstated probationary employees.\u201d      Dkt. 42 at 5 (citing Dep\u2019t of Educ. v.\n\n        California, No. 24A910, 2025 WL 1008354 (U.S. Apr. 4, 2025) (per curiam)). But\n\n                                                 16\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248     Doc: 51       Filed: 04/10/2025    Pg: 19 of 131\n\n\n\n\n        the panel majority ignored that the Agencies \u201cwould have had to pay probationary\n\n        employees\u2019 salaries for a statutory period anyway\u201d under federal law. Dkt. 42 at 12\n\n        (Benjamin, J., dissenting) (emphasis added) (citing 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.801).\n\n              Nor does the preliminary injunction significantly burden the Agencies\u2019\n\n        internal affairs. To the contrary, \u201c[r]equiring the federal government to adhere to\n\n        statutory notice requirements as set forth by federal law can hardly be considered\n\n        \u2018micromanaging.\u2019\u201d Dkt. 42 at 8 n.4 (Benjamin, J., dissenting). Indeed, the district\n\n        court explicitly permitted the Agencies to move forward with legitimate RIFs during\n\n        the pendency of this case, so long as they follow the proper procedures and provide\n\n        the statutorily required notice to the States. That the Agencies have opted not to do\n\n        so is a \u201cself-imposed\u201d harm. Dkt. 42 at 12 (Benjamin, J., dissenting) (internal\n\n        quotation marks omitted).\n\n              The States should not bear the burden of the Agencies\u2019 unprecedented and\n\n        illegal terminations. The stay will only compound that burden. It will resurrect the\n\n        harms that prompted this action, forcing the States to once again scramble to aid\n\n        residents in finding new jobs or accessing public benefits.\n\n                                         CONCLUSION\n\n              The petition for rehearing en banc should be granted and the panel\u2019s April 9,\n\n        2025 stay order should be vacated.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 17\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248    Doc: 51        Filed: 04/10/2025   Pg: 20 of 131\n\n\n\n\n                                                   Respectfully submitted,\n\n         BRIAN L.

Plaintiffs allege that the\n\n        Government violated federal law when it terminated thousands of probationary federal\n\n        employees without following the procedures required for a reduction in force, including\n\n        advance notice to the affected States. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502; 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.803(b). The\n\n        district court agreed with Plaintiffs and entered a preliminary injunction requiring the\n\n        Government to reinstate the probationary employees who reside or work in Plaintiff States\n\n        and refrain from further alleged reductions in force except in compliance with the notice\n\n        requirements of \u00a7 3502. Maryland v. USDA, --- F. Supp. 3d ---, 2025 WL 973159, at *40-\n\n        42 (D. Md. April 1, 2025).\n\n              The Government now asks us to stay the district court\u2019s preliminary injunction.\n\n        Among other things, the Government argues that the States lack Article III standing to\n\n        challenge the terminations and that the district court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction\n\n        because the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, Pub. L. No. 95-454, provides the exclusive\n\n        means for review of personnel actions taken against federal employees.\n\n              Having reviewed the record, the district court\u2019s opinion, and the parties\u2019 briefing,\n\n        we agree with the Government that it has satisfied the factors for a stay under Nken v.\n                                                   4\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248\nUSCA4                           42\n                           Doc: 51         Filed: 04/09/2025\n                                                  04/10/2025      Pg: 5\n                                                                      33ofof12\n                                                                             131\n\n\n\n\n        Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 426 (2009). The Government is likely to succeed in showing the\n\n        district court lacked jurisdiction over Plaintiffs\u2019 claims, and the Government is unlikely to\n\n        recover the funds disbursed to reinstated probationary employees. Cf. Dep\u2019t of Educ. v.\n\n        California, No. 24A910, 2025 WL 1008354, at *1 (U.S. Apr. 4, 2025) (per curiam). The\n\n        Supreme Court has stayed a similar preliminary injunction issued by the United States\n\n        District Court for the Northern District of California. See OPM v. AFGE, No. 24A904,\n\n        2025 WL 1035208, at *1 (U.S. Apr. 8, 2025) (mem.). We therefore grant the Government\u2019s\n\n        motion for a stay of the preliminary injunction pending this appeal.

The district court entered a well-reasoned memorandum opinion and order granting\n\n        a preliminary injunction, and then denied a motion for stay pending appeal. For the below\n\n        reasons and those explained in thorough detail by the district court, I would deny the\n\n        Government\u2019s motion.\n\n\n\n                                                      I.\n\n                                                      A.\n\n               As a threshold matter, per the district court\u2019s order, the States1 clearly have standing\n\n        to challenge the process by which the Government has engaged in mass firings.2 To\n\n        establish standing, \u201cthe plaintiff must have a \u2018 \u201cpersonal stake\u201d \u2019 in the case.\u201d TransUnion\n\n        LLC v. Ramirez, 594 U.S. 413, 423 (2021) (quoting Raines v. Byrd, 521 U.S. 811, 819\n\n        (1997)). To prove a personal stake, \u201cplaintiffs must be able to sufficiently answer the\n\n        question: \u2018 \u201cWhat\u2019s it to you?\u201d \u2019 \u201d Id. (quoting Antonin Scalia, The Doctrine of Standing\n\n\n               1\n                Plaintiff States are a consortium of nineteen states (Maryland, Minnesota, Arizona,\n        California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan,\n        Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont,\n        Wisconsin) and the District of Columbia.\n               2\n                 This is an important distinction. The Government repeatedly mischaracterizes the\n        basis of the States\u2019 claims, suggesting that the States are attempting to sue on behalf of\n        their respective citizens for alleged unlawful firings. This mischaracterization not only\n        misses the point but\u2014more seriously\u2014distracts from the States\u2019 actual alleged harm. The\n        States were entitled to proper notice, which the Government did not give. That is the basis\n        for the instant suit.\n\n                                                      6\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248\nUSCA4                           42\n                           Doc: 51          Filed: 04/09/2025\n                                                   04/10/2025     Pg: 7\n                                                                      35ofof12\n                                                                             131\n\n\n\n\n        as an Essential Element of the Separation of Powers, 17 Suffolk U. L. Rev. 881, 882\n\n        (1983)). A satisfactory answer to this question requires a plaintiff to show \u201c(i) that he\n\n        suffered an injury in fact that is concrete, particularized, and actual or imminent; (ii) that\n\n        the injury was likely caused by the defendant; and (iii) that the injury would likely be\n\n        redressed by judicial relief.\u201d Id. (citing Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560\u2013\n\n        61 (1992)).\n\n               The Supreme Court has recognized that certain intangible injuries, including an\n\n        \u201cinformational injury,\u201d can support standing. See, e.g., Fed. Election Comm\u2019n v. Akins,\n\n        524 U.S. 11, 24\u201325 (1998); Pub. Citizen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 491 U.S. 440, 449 (1989).\n\n        \u201cA statutory violation alone,\u201d however, \u201cdoes not create a concrete informational injury\n\n        sufficient to support standing.\u201d Dreher v. Experian Info. Sols., Inc., 856 F.3d 337, 345 (4th\n\n        Cir. 2017) (citing Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 578 U.S. 330, 341\u201342 (2016)). Instead, a\n\n        \u201cconstitutionally cognizable informational injury requires that a person lack access to\n\n        information to which he is legally entitled and that the denial of that information creates a\n\n        \u2018real\u2019 harm with an adverse effect.\u201d Id. (quoting Spokeo, 578 U.S. at 339\u201340).\n\n               By this standard, the States\u2019 informational injury cannot be a \u201cdead end,\u201d as the\n\n        Government claims. See Mot. for stay pending appeal at 1. First, pursuant to 5 U.S.C.\n\n        \u00a7 3502(d), the Government was legally required to inform the States at least 60 days before\n\n        any reduction in force (\u201cRIF\u201d). See also 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.803(b). The Government failed\n\n        to do so, thereby depriving the States of information to which they were legally entitled\n\n        and satisfying the first requirement of a constitutionally cognizable informational injury.\n\n        See Dreher, 856 F.3d at 345. Next, as discussed in depth by the district court, the denial\n                                                   7\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248\nUSCA4                           42\n                           Doc: 51         Filed: 04/09/2025\n                                                  04/10/2025     Pg: 8\n                                                                     36ofof12\n                                                                            131\n\n\n\n\n        of this notice has, and will continue to, cause real harm with significant adverse effects.\n\n        See Mem. Op. on prelim. inj. (D. ECF No. 125) at 10\u201316.3 Such adverse effects include,\n\n        but are not limited to, an increase in unemployment benefits applications, an increase in\n\n        the resources required to investigate this influx in unemployment benefits applications,\n\n        additional financial and labor costs associated with the sudden strain placed on rapid\n\n        response programs without advance notice, unanticipated loss of tax revenue, and the loss\n\n        of support from federal employees who were working with various state agencies.4 See id.\n\n        These harms, among others, plainly satisfy the concreteness requirement and thus provide\n\n        the necessary grounds for Article III standing. See Dreher, 856 F.3d at 345.\n\n               Further, the district court correctly distinguished this case from United States v.\n\n        Texas, 599 U.S. 670 (2023). Asking the Government \u201cto change its arrest or prosecution\n\n        policies so that the Executive Branch makes more arrests or initiates more prosecutions\u201d is\n\n        a far cry from requiring the Government to adhere to a statutory notice requirement. See\n\n        id. at 677. The former \u201crun[s] up against the Executive\u2019s Article II authority to enforce\n\n\n\n               3\n                Page numbers for citations to ECF documents utilize the document\u2019s native\n        numbering.\n               4\n                 The Government\u2019s argument regarding the harms suffered by the States as a result\n        of the lack of statutory notice is concerning. See Mot. for stay pending appeal at 13\n        (arguing that allowing standing \u201cbased on downstream harms to state budgets and\n        operations from the termination of probationary employees\u201d is \u201ca recipe for any state to\n        micromanage the activities of the federal government\u201d and \u201cirreconcilable with Supreme\n        Court precedent\u201d). Requiring the federal government to adhere to statutory notice\n        requirements as set forth by federal law can hardly be considered \u201cmicromanaging.\u201d As\n        explained below, the Government had the opportunity to conduct the RIF according to\n        statutory procedure and chose not to do so.\n\n                                                    8\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248\nUSCA4                           42\n                           Doc: 51          Filed: 04/09/2025\n                                                   04/10/2025     Pg: 9\n                                                                      37ofof12\n                                                                             131\n\n\n\n\n        federal law\u201d and seeks to mandate something of the Government that was not already\n\n        required. Id. at 678. The latter merely asks the Government to comply with a required\n\n        procedure.\n\n               In the same vein, the relationship between the action (or inaction) by the\n\n        Government and the alleged harm is also distinct. In Texas, the states sought damages for\n\n        the costs associated with incarceration and social services based on the Government\u2019s\n\n        failure to exercise its discretion\u2014i.e., its discretionary inaction. Id. at 674, 684\u201385. Here,\n\n        the alleged harms, namely, the unexpected increased financial burden placed on rapid\n\n        response programs, are a result of the Government\u2019s failure to adhere to statutory notice\n\n        requirements\u2014i.e., its actions contrary to law. One is tangentially related to actions that\n\n        the Government was not required to take, while the other is directly related to an action\n\n        the Government was required to and failed to take. For these reasons, and those aptly\n\n        explained by the district court, Texas is inapplicable here.5\n\n\n\n\n               5\n                 On April 8, 2025, the Supreme Court stayed the preliminary injunction entered by\n        the United States District Court for the Northern District of California in its similar\n        probationary employee RIF case. See OPM v. AFGE, No. 24A904 (U.S. Apr. 8, 2025).\n        The Ninth Circuit had denied a motion to stay pending appeal. See Am. Fed\u2019n of Gov\u2019t\n        Emps., AFL-CIO v. United States Off. of Pers. Mgmt., No. 25-1677, 2025 WL 914823 (9th\n        Cir. Mar. 26, 2025). Like United States v. Texas, 599 U.S. 670 (2023), the decision in\n        AFGE is not applicable to the present case. The Supreme Court specifically noted \u201c[t]he\n        District Court\u2019s injunction was based solely on the allegations of the nine non-profit-\n        organization plaintiffs.\u201d See AFGE, No. 24A904. The basis of standing is different here,\n        where States are suing under a statutory scheme relevant to states.\n\n                                                      9\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248\nUSCA4                           42\n                           Doc: 51         Filed: 04/09/2025\n                                                  04/10/2025     Pg: 10\n                                                                     38 of 12\n                                                                           131\n\n\n\n\n               Accordingly, the States have successfully answered the question: \u201cWhat\u2019s it to\n\n        them?\u201d    See TransUnion LLC, 594 U.S. at 423.

Community Nutrition Institute, 467 U.S. 340 (1984) is\n\n        unavailing and \u201crel[ies] crucially on the idea that there is an identity of interests between\n\n        the States and the fired employees.\u201d Id. at 37; see also id. at 35\u201337. \u201cBut,\u201d as the district\n\n        court made clear, \u201cthat is not so.\u201d Id. at 37.\n\n               For the above reasons, I do not believe the Government can defeat the States\u2019\n\n        standing.\n\n\n\n                                                         II.\n\n               The Government also cannot satisfy the standard for a stay pending appeal. Those\n\n        factors are \u201c(1) whether the stay applicant has made a strong showing that he is likely to\n\n        succeed on the merits; (2) whether the applicant will be irreparably injured absent a stay;\n\n        (3) whether issuance of the stay will substantially injure the other parties interested in the\n\n        proceeding; and (4) where the public interest lies.\u201d Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 434\n\n        (2009) (quoting Hilton v. Braunskill, 481 U.S. 770, 776 (1987)).\n\n               The Government must satisfy all four factors. But I do not believe it can satisfy\n\n        any. I write to highlight the Government\u2019s lack of a convincing argument on irreparable\n\n        harm. See Nken, 556 U.S. at 434\u201335 (2009). The Government asserts that it cannot recover\n\n        salaries it is currently paying to reinstated probationary employees, and that the preliminary\n\n        injunction is a disruption to the CSRA process.

The\n\n        preliminary injunction order expressly states \u201c[n]othing in this Order prohibits the\n\n        Government from conducting lawful terminations of probationary federal employees\u2014\n\n        whether (1) pursuant to a proper RIF . . . or else (2) for cause . . . under the standards for\n\n        making such determinations set forth in the TRO Memorandum.\u201d Prelim.

Additionally, if the Government had followed the statutory RIF\n\n        notice procedure, it would have had to pay probationary employees\u2019 salaries for a statutory\n\n        period anyway. See 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.801. And, as explained earlier, the States are not\n\n        alleging a violation of the CSRA, nor are they attempting to step into the probationary\n\n        employees\u2019 place for a CSRA challenge.

The panel should\n\n        now decline the states\u2019 unusual request to stay its own stay order\u2014and\n\n        thereby re-enjoin the government\u2014pending disposition of the states\u2019\n\n        forthcoming petition for rehearing en banc.\n\n              1.   The panel has already determined\u2014\u201c[h]aving reviewed the\n\n        record, the district court\u2019s opinion, and the parties\u2019 briefing\u201d\u2014that the\n\n        stay factors favor the federal government. See Order 4-5 (Apr. 9, 2025).\n\n        The motions panel emphasized that \u201c[t]he Government is likely to\n\n        succeed in showing the district court lacked jurisdiction over Plaintiffs\u2019\n\n        claims, and the Government is unlikely to recover the funds disbursed\n\n        to reinstated probationary employees.\u201d See id. The states offer no\n\n        response to these holdings, and instead simply repeat their contention,\n\n        which the panel has already rejected, that terminations of probationary\n\n        employees would cause various harms to the states\u2019 revenues and\n\n        taxbases. Mot. 2. The states identify no reason why the panel would\n\n        reach a different conclusion in this posture.\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 46      Filed: 04/10/2025   Pg: 3 of 6\n\n\n\n\n              2.   Nor do the states\u2019 cursory arguments establish that en banc\n\n        review is likely. Mot. 1-2. This Court does not typically grant en banc\n\n        review of a motions panel decision. And although the states insist that\n\n        this case \u201cconcerns a matter of exceptional importance,\u201d Mot. 1, they do\n\n        not identify any legal argument for why the motions panel\u2019s decision is\n\n        incorrect. The mere fact that this case is important\u2014to both the states\n\n        and the federal government\u2014cannot be a reason why the considered\n\n        decision of the motions panel should not be able to promptly take effect,\n\n        particularly in light of the panel\u2019s conclusion that the injunction inflicts\n\n        irreparable harm on the government.\n\n              The motions panel\u2019s decision is consistent, moreover, with a recent\n\n        decision of the Supreme Court staying a \u201csimilar preliminary injunction\n\n        issued by the United States District Court for the Northern District of\n\n        California,\u201d which had required the reinstatement of previously\n\n        terminated probationary employees. See Order 5 (citing OPM v. AFGE,\n\n        No. 24A904, 2025 WL 1035208, at *1 (U.S. Apr. 8, 2025) (mem.)). In\n\n        granting that stay motion, the Supreme Court necessarily determined\n\n        that the government had established irreparable harm. See also\n\n        Hollingsworth v. Perry, 558 U.S. 183, 190 (2010) (\u201cTo obtain a stay\n\n\n                                              2\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 46         Filed: 04/10/2025   Pg: 4 of 6\n\n\n\n\n        pending the filing and disposition of a petition for a writ of certiorari, an\n\n        applicant must show \u2026 a likelihood that irreparable harm will result\n\n        from the denial of a stay.\u201d).\n\n                                        CONCLUSION\n\n              For the foregoing reasons, the Court should deny the motion for\n\n        an administrative stay.\n\n                                                     Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                                     YAAKOV M.

Appellant Agencies oppose this motion.\n\n       Rehearing en banc is appropriate because, among other reasons, this case\n\nconcerns a matter of exceptional importance: whether 20 federal agencies injured 19\n\nStates and the District of Columbia through the sudden and unlawful mass layoff of\n\nthousands of federal probationary employees without the 60-day advance notice\n\nrequired by federal law, and whether the Agencies should be permitted to resume\n\ntheir unlawful conduct while this case is pending. See Loc. R. 40(2)(D). The\n\fquestion of whether the States have standing to seek redress is of vital importance\n\nand merits review by the full court.\n\n        If the status quo is not preserved through an immediate administrative stay,\n\nthe Agencies will likely terminate thousands of probationary employees once again\n\nwhile the en banc court considers the States\u2019 petition. Allowing mass firings to go\n\nforward in this manner will cause chaos in, and significant injury to, the States.\n\nThese unrecoverable costs and irreparable injuries include (1) expenses imposed on\n\nstate rapid-response teams; (2) a surge in unemployment claims, often requiring\n\nexhaustive investigations; (3) disruption and damage to state programs depending\n\non federal workers; and (4) financial harms from decreased tax revenue and\n\nincreased reliance on state social service programs. (See ECF No. 125, at 9-16.)\n\n        The States accordingly seek a brief administrative stay from the panel pending\n\ndisposition of their petition for rehearing en banc. Such a stay would preserve the\n\nstatus quo during the pendency of the States\u2019 petition and thus would appropriately\n\nprevent the potential whipsaw effect of differing court decisions in a short period of\n\ntime.\n\n\n\n\n                                           2\n\fRespectfully submitted,\n\nKEITH ELLISON                                ANTHONY G.

Plaintiffs allege that the\n\nGovernment violated federal law when it terminated thousands of probationary federal\n\nemployees without following the procedures required for a reduction in force, including\n\nadvance notice to the affected States. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502; 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.803(b). The\n\ndistrict court agreed with Plaintiffs and entered a preliminary injunction requiring the\n\nGovernment to reinstate the probationary employees who reside or work in Plaintiff States\n\nand refrain from further alleged reductions in force except in compliance with the notice\n\nrequirements of \u00a7 3502. Maryland v. USDA, --- F. Supp. 3d ---, 2025 WL 973159, at *40-\n\n42 (D. Md. April 1, 2025).\n\n      The Government now asks us to stay the district court\u2019s preliminary injunction.\n\nAmong other things, the Government argues that the States lack Article III standing to\n\nchallenge the terminations and that the district court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction\n\nbecause the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, Pub. L. No. 95-454, provides the exclusive\n\nmeans for review of personnel actions taken against federal employees.\n\n      Having reviewed the record, the district court\u2019s opinion, and the parties\u2019 briefing,\n\nwe agree with the Government that it has satisfied the factors for a stay under Nken v.\n                                           4\n\fHolder, 556 U.S. 418, 426 (2009). The Government is likely to succeed in showing the\n\ndistrict court lacked jurisdiction over Plaintiffs\u2019 claims, and the Government is unlikely to\n\nrecover the funds disbursed to reinstated probationary employees. Cf. Dep\u2019t of Educ. v.\n\nCalifornia, No. 24A910, 2025 WL 1008354, at *1 (U.S. Apr. 4, 2025) (per curiam). The\n\nSupreme Court has stayed a similar preliminary injunction issued by the United States\n\nDistrict Court for the Northern District of California. See OPM v. AFGE, No. 24A904,\n\n2025 WL 1035208, at *1 (U.S. Apr. 8, 2025) (mem.). We therefore grant the Government\u2019s\n\nmotion for a stay of the preliminary injunction pending this appeal. The Clerk will set an\n\nexpedited briefing schedule.\n\n       Entered at the direction of Judge Rushing, with the concurrence of Judge Wilkinson.\n\nJudge Benjamin filed a separate dissenting opinion.\n\n                                                  For the Court\n\n                                                  /s/ Nwamaka Anowi, Clerk\n\n\n\n\n                                             5\n\fDEANDREA GIST BENJAMIN, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n\n       The majority votes to stay the preliminary injunction pending the resolution of the\n\nappeal. The district court entered a well-reasoned memorandum opinion and order granting\n\na preliminary injunction, and then denied a motion for stay pending appeal. For the below\n\nreasons and those explained in thorough detail by the district court, I would deny the\n\nGovernment\u2019s motion.\n\n\n\n                                              I.\n\n                                              A.\n\n       As a threshold matter, per the district court\u2019s order, the States1 clearly have standing\n\nto challenge the process by which the Government has engaged in mass firings.2 To\n\nestablish standing, \u201cthe plaintiff must have a \u2018 \u201cpersonal stake\u201d \u2019 in the case.\u201d TransUnion\n\nLLC v. Ramirez, 594 U.S. 413, 423 (2021) (quoting Raines v. Byrd, 521 U.S. 811, 819\n\n(1997)). To prove a personal stake, \u201cplaintiffs must be able to sufficiently answer the\n\nquestion: \u2018 \u201cWhat\u2019s it to you?\u201d \u2019 \u201d Id. (quoting Antonin Scalia, The Doctrine of Standing\n\n\n       1\n        Plaintiff States are a consortium of nineteen states (Maryland, Minnesota, Arizona,\nCalifornia, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan,\nNevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont,\nWisconsin) and the District of Columbia.\n       2\n         This is an important distinction. The Government repeatedly mischaracterizes the\nbasis of the States\u2019 claims, suggesting that the States are attempting to sue on behalf of\ntheir respective citizens for alleged unlawful firings. This mischaracterization not only\nmisses the point but\u2014more seriously\u2014distracts from the States\u2019 actual alleged harm. The\nStates were entitled to proper notice, which the Government did not give. That is the basis\nfor the instant suit.\n\n                                              6\n\fas an Essential Element of the Separation of Powers, 17 Suffolk U. L. Rev. 881, 882\n\n(1983)). A satisfactory answer to this question requires a plaintiff to show \u201c(i) that he\n\nsuffered an injury in fact that is concrete, particularized, and actual or imminent; (ii) that\n\nthe injury was likely caused by the defendant; and (iii) that the injury would likely be\n\nredressed by judicial relief.\u201d Id. (citing Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560\u2013\n\n61 (1992)).\n\n       The Supreme Court has recognized that certain intangible injuries, including an\n\n\u201cinformational injury,\u201d can support standing. See, e.g., Fed. Election Comm\u2019n v. Akins,\n\n524 U.S. 11, 24\u201325 (1998); Pub. Citizen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 491 U.S. 440, 449 (1989).\n\n\u201cA statutory violation alone,\u201d however, \u201cdoes not create a concrete informational injury\n\nsufficient to support standing.\u201d Dreher v. Experian Info. Sols., Inc., 856 F.3d 337, 345 (4th\n\nCir. 2017) (citing Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 578 U.S. 330, 341\u201342 (2016)). Instead, a\n\n\u201cconstitutionally cognizable informational injury requires that a person lack access to\n\ninformation to which he is legally entitled and that the denial of that information creates a\n\n\u2018real\u2019 harm with an adverse effect.\u201d Id. (quoting Spokeo, 578 U.S. at 339\u201340).\n\n       By this standard, the States\u2019 informational injury cannot be a \u201cdead end,\u201d as the\n\nGovernment claims. See Mot. for stay pending appeal at 1. First, pursuant to 5 U.S.C.\n\n\u00a7 3502(d), the Government was legally required to inform the States at least 60 days before\n\nany reduction in force (\u201cRIF\u201d). See also 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.803(b). The Government failed\n\nto do so, thereby depriving the States of information to which they were legally entitled\n\nand satisfying the first requirement of a constitutionally cognizable informational injury.\n\nSee Dreher, 856 F.3d at 345. Next, as discussed in depth by the district court, the denial\n                                          7\n\fof this notice has, and will continue to, cause real harm with significant adverse effects.\n\nSee Mem. Op. on prelim. inj. (D. ECF No. 125) at 10\u201316.3 Such adverse effects include,\n\nbut are not limited to, an increase in unemployment benefits applications, an increase in\n\nthe resources required to investigate this influx in unemployment benefits applications,\n\nadditional financial and labor costs associated with the sudden strain placed on rapid\n\nresponse programs without advance notice, unanticipated loss of tax revenue, and the loss\n\nof support from federal employees who were working with various state agencies.4 See id.\n\nThese harms, among others, plainly satisfy the concreteness requirement and thus provide\n\nthe necessary grounds for Article III standing. See Dreher, 856 F.3d at 345.\n\n       Further, the district court correctly distinguished this case from United States v.\n\nTexas, 599 U.S. 670 (2023). Asking the Government \u201cto change its arrest or prosecution\n\npolicies so that the Executive Branch makes more arrests or initiates more prosecutions\u201d is\n\na far cry from requiring the Government to adhere to a statutory notice requirement. See\n\nid. at 677. The former \u201crun[s] up against the Executive\u2019s Article II authority to enforce\n\n\n\n       3\n        Page numbers for citations to ECF documents utilize the document\u2019s native\nnumbering.\n       4\n         The Government\u2019s argument regarding the harms suffered by the States as a result\nof the lack of statutory notice is concerning. See Mot. for stay pending appeal at 13\n(arguing that allowing standing \u201cbased on downstream harms to state budgets and\noperations from the termination of probationary employees\u201d is \u201ca recipe for any state to\nmicromanage the activities of the federal government\u201d and \u201cirreconcilable with Supreme\nCourt precedent\u201d). Requiring the federal government to adhere to statutory notice\nrequirements as set forth by federal law can hardly be considered \u201cmicromanaging.\u201d As\nexplained below, the Government had the opportunity to conduct the RIF according to\nstatutory procedure and chose not to do so.\n\n                                            8\n\ffederal law\u201d and seeks to mandate something of the Government that was not already\n\nrequired. Id. at 678. The latter merely asks the Government to comply with a required\n\nprocedure.\n\n       In the same vein, the relationship between the action (or inaction) by the\n\nGovernment and the alleged harm is also distinct. In Texas, the states sought damages for\n\nthe costs associated with incarceration and social services based on the Government\u2019s\n\nfailure to exercise its discretion\u2014i.e., its discretionary inaction. Id. at 674, 684\u201385. Here,\n\nthe alleged harms, namely, the unexpected increased financial burden placed on rapid\n\nresponse programs, are a result of the Government\u2019s failure to adhere to statutory notice\n\nrequirements\u2014i.e., its actions contrary to law. One is tangentially related to actions that\n\nthe Government was not required to take, while the other is directly related to an action\n\nthe Government was required to and failed to take. For these reasons, and those aptly\n\nexplained by the district court, Texas is inapplicable here.5\n\n\n\n\n       5\n         On April 8, 2025, the Supreme Court stayed the preliminary injunction entered by\nthe United States District Court for the Northern District of California in its similar\nprobationary employee RIF case. See OPM v. AFGE, No. 24A904 (U.S. Apr. 8, 2025).\nThe Ninth Circuit had denied a motion to stay pending appeal. See Am. Fed\u2019n of Gov\u2019t\nEmps., AFL-CIO v. United States Off. of Pers. Mgmt., No. 25-1677, 2025 WL 914823 (9th\nCir. Mar. 26, 2025). Like United States v. Texas, 599 U.S. 670 (2023), the decision in\nAFGE is not applicable to the present case. The Supreme Court specifically noted \u201c[t]he\nDistrict Court\u2019s injunction was based solely on the allegations of the nine non-profit-\norganization plaintiffs.\u201d See AFGE, No. 24A904. The basis of standing is different here,\nwhere States are suing under a statutory scheme relevant to states.\n\n                                              9\n\f       Accordingly, the States have successfully answered the question: \u201cWhat\u2019s it to\n\nthem?\u201d    See TransUnion LLC, 594 U.S. at 423.           Standing based on the alleged\n\ninformational injury is thus appropriate here.\n\n                                            B.\n\n       Nor does the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (\u201cCSRA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7101\u201335,\n\ndefeat the district court\u2019s jurisdiction. The CSRA \u201cprovides for the original and exclusive\n\nadministrative review of certain labor- and employment-related claims brought by federal\n\nemployees and/or their unions.\u201d Mem. Op. on prelim. inj. at 32. The Government argues\n\nthe CSRA precludes the States\u2019 claims because \u201cat bottom, [they] rest on allegations that\n\nthe government unlawfully terminated probationary employees . . . and the states sought\u2014\n\nand the district court granted\u2014reinstatement of affected employees.\u201d Mot. for stay\n\npending appeal at 21\u201322.\n\n       The States do not dispute that they cannot receive relief under the CSRA\u2014instead,\n\nthey have consistently argued that their harm arises from an independent \u201cstatutory right[]\n\nto notice.\u201d Mem. in support of motion for prelim. inj. (D. ECF No. 78-1) at 15. I, like the\n\ndistrict court, am not prepared to accept \u201cthe faulty premise that the States [are] simply\n\ntrying to vindicate the interests of the terminated workers (as opposed to their own and\n\nseparate harms as \u2018state qua states\u2019).\u201d Mem. Op. on prelim. inj. at 33.\n\n       I also cannot ignore the Supreme Court\u2019s analytical framework for assessing\n\nwhether a district court is divested of jurisdiction in favor of the Government\u2019s preferred\n\nframework. As ably set out by the district court, \u201cpursuant to . . . Thunder Basin Coal Co.\n\nv. Reich, 510 U.S. 200 (1994), there [is] no reason to believe Congress ha[s] divested the\n                                            10\n\fdistrict courts of jurisdiction over the States\u2019 claims in this case.\u201d Mem. Op. on prelim.\n\ninj. at 31; see also id. at 31\u201333. The Government\u2019s attempt to review the jurisdictional\n\nquestion pursuant to Block v. Community Nutrition Institute, 467 U.S. 340 (1984) is\n\nunavailing and \u201crel[ies] crucially on the idea that there is an identity of interests between\n\nthe States and the fired employees.\u201d Id. at 37; see also id. at 35\u201337. \u201cBut,\u201d as the district\n\ncourt made clear, \u201cthat is not so.\u201d Id. at 37.\n\n       For the above reasons, I do not believe the Government can defeat the States\u2019\n\nstanding.\n\n\n\n                                                 II.\n\n       The Government also cannot satisfy the standard for a stay pending appeal. Those\n\nfactors are \u201c(1) whether the stay applicant has made a strong showing that he is likely to\n\nsucceed on the merits; (2) whether the applicant will be irreparably injured absent a stay;\n\n(3) whether issuance of the stay will substantially injure the other parties interested in the\n\nproceeding; and (4) where the public interest lies.\u201d Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 434\n\n(2009) (quoting Hilton v. Braunskill, 481 U.S. 770, 776 (1987)).\n\n       The Government must satisfy all four factors. But I do not believe it can satisfy\n\nany. I write to highlight the Government\u2019s lack of a convincing argument on irreparable\n\nharm. See Nken, 556 U.S. at 434\u201335 (2009). The Government asserts that it cannot recover\n\nsalaries it is currently paying to reinstated probationary employees, and that the preliminary\n\ninjunction is a disruption to the CSRA process. See Mot. for stay pending appeal at 25\u2013\n\n27.\n                                                 11\n\f       The Government\u2019s monetary injury, if any, is \u201c \u2018self-imposed.\u2019 \u201d See Dep\u2019t of Educ.\n\nv. California, __ S. Ct. __, __, No. 24A910, 2025 WL 1008354, at *1 (quoting Cuomo v.\n\nU.S. Nuclear Regul. Comm\u2019n, 772 F.2d 972, 977 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (per curiam)). The\n\npreliminary injunction order expressly states \u201c[n]othing in this Order prohibits the\n\nGovernment from conducting lawful terminations of probationary federal employees\u2014\n\nwhether (1) pursuant to a proper RIF . . . or else (2) for cause . . . under the standards for\n\nmaking such determinations set forth in the TRO Memorandum.\u201d Prelim. Inj. order (D.\n\nECF No. 126) at 2 n.1. Additionally, if the Government had followed the statutory RIF\n\nnotice procedure, it would have had to pay probationary employees\u2019 salaries for a statutory\n\nperiod anyway. See 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.801. And, as explained earlier, the States are not\n\nalleging a violation of the CSRA, nor are they attempting to step into the probationary\n\nemployees\u2019 place for a CSRA challenge. See Mem. Op. on prelim. inj. at 33\u201337.\n\n\n\n                                             III.\n\n       I see no reason to stay the district court\u2019s preliminary injunction pending its appeal.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n                                             12\n\f",

USDA, No. 25-1248 (L)\n\nDear Ms. Anowi:\n\n       The government respectfully writes to inform the Court of the Supreme\nCourt\u2019s decision in OPM et al. v. AFGE, et. al., No. 24A904 (U.S. Apr. 8, 2025).\nAs the government has explained, see Mot. for Stay Pending Appeal 12 n.3 (Apr.\n4, 2025), the AFGE litigation involves a preliminary injunction issued by the\nNorthern District of California requiring the government to reinstate probationary\nemployees at the Departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture, Defense, Energy,\nInterior, and Treasury. The Ninth Circuit denied a stay pending appeal, and the\ngovernment sought a stay from the Supreme Court.\n\n      Earlier today, the Supreme Court granted the government\u2019s stay application,\nholding that the plaintiffs on whose claims the district court had based preliminary\ninjunctive relief had failed to demonstrate standing. A copy of the Supreme\nCourt\u2019s order is attached.\n\n\n                                       Sincerely,\n\n                                       /s/ Steven A. Myers\n                                       Steven A. Myers\n\ncc: all counsel (by ECF)\n\f(ORDER LIST:   604 U.S.)\n\n\n                              TUESDAY, APRIL 8, 2025\n\n\n\n                               ORDER IN PENDING CASE\n\n24A904     OPM, ET AL. V. AFGE, ET AL.\n\n                  The application for stay presented to Justice Kagan and by\n\n           her referred to the Court is granted.       The March 13, 2025\n\n           preliminary injunction entered by the United States District\n\n           Court for the Northern District of California, case No. 3:25-cv-\n\n           1780, is stayed pending the disposition of the appeal in the\n\n           United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and\n\n           disposition of a petition for a writ of certiorari, if such a\n\n           writ is timely sought.     Should certiorari be denied, this stay\n\n           shall terminate automatically.      In the event certiorari is\n\n           granted, the stay shall terminate upon the sending down of the\n\n           judgment of this Court.\n\n                  The District Court\u2019s injunction was based solely on the\n\n           allegations of the nine non-profit-organization plaintiffs in\n\n           this case.      But under established law, those allegations are\n\n           presently insufficient to support the organizations\u2019 standing.\n\n           See, e.g., Clapper v. Amnesty Int\u2019l USA, 568 U. S. 398 (2013).\n\n           This order does not address the claims of the other plaintiffs,\n\n           which did not form the basis of the District Court\u2019s preliminary\n\n           injunction.\n\n                  Justice Sotomayor would deny the application.\n\n                  Justice Jackson would have declined to reach the standing\n\n           question in the context of an application for emergency relief\n\fwhere the issue is pending in the lower courts and the applicants\n\nhave not demonstrated urgency in the form of interim irreparable\n\nharm.   See Department of Education v. California, 604 U. S. ___,\n\n___ (2025) (Jackson, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 1\u20132).

Nothing in the states\u2019\n\n        opposition undermines any of those points, and this Court should enter\n\n        a stay pending appeal.\n\n                                      ARGUMENT\n\n        I.    The Government Is Likely To Prevail On The Merits.\n\n              A.   The District Court Lacked Jurisdiction.\n\n                   1.    Article III Standing\n\n              The states\u2019 cursory efforts to defend the district court\u2019s standing\n\n        analysis, see Resp. 15-17, are unavailing. As set out in our motion, the\n\n        district court rested its standing analysis on only one theory of injury\u2014\n\n        an informational injury that led to downstream economic harms. Op.\n\n        17. But that theory fails for multiple reasons.\n\n              At the outset, there is a basic mismatch between the purported\n\n        informational injury the states assert (failure to receive pre-termination\n\n        notice) and the sweeping remedy the district court imposed\n\n        (reinstatement of thousands of employees). As our motion explained, a\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 39      Filed: 04/07/2025   Pg: 4 of 15\n\n\n\n\n        plaintiff seeking injunctive relief on a theory of informational injury\n\n        asserts that a judicial order would lead him to obtain information he\n\n        lacks. Mot. 16-17. Here, the states are undoubtedly aware of the\n\n        terminations that they challenge in this lawsuit, and to the extent they\n\n        suggest otherwise, see Resp. 16, they provide no specifics as to what\n\n        information is now being withheld from them.\n\n              The primary case upon which plaintiffs rely, Laufer v. Naranda\n\n        Hotels, LLC, 60 F.4th 156, 171 (4th Cir. 2023), cited in Resp. 17, only\n\n        confirms the incongruity between the state\u2019s theory of informational\n\n        injury and the district court\u2019s reinstatement order. In Laufer, a\n\n        disabled plaintiff alleged an \u201cinformational injury\u201d from a lack of\n\n        required information on a hotel website about \u201caccessible features\u201d and\n\n        sought an order requiring the hotel to provide the information on its\n\n        website consistent with the regulation. Id. at 159-60; see also\n\n        Complaint at 9, Laufer v. Naranda Hotels LLC, No. 1:20-cv-02136-CCB\n\n        (D. Md. Aug. 17, 2020), ECF No. 4. The court accepted that Laufer had\n\n        \u201calleged an informational injury that gives her Article III standing to\n\n        sue,\u201d Laufer, 60 F.4th at 166, and given the obvious connection between\n\n        the asserted injury (missing information) and the requested relief (an\n\n\n                                              2\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 39       Filed: 04/07/2025   Pg: 5 of 15\n\n\n\n\n        order to provide it), the Court observed that the defendant had not even\n\n        contested redressability in district court, id. at 167.\n\n              Here, by contrast, the court\u2019s reinstatement order does nothing to\n\n        remedy the informational injury of which the states complain, and\n\n        indeed that purported informational injury no longer existed by the\n\n        time the states filed their lawsuit. Plaintiffs, like the district court, cite\n\n        no authority establishing that an informational injury remains\n\n        redressable even after the plaintiff has obtained the information it\n\n        claimed was missing, or that courts may grant relief for an\n\n        \u201cinformational injury\u201d that goes far beyond redressing the lack of\n\n        information itself.\n\n              The states\u2019 asserted \u201cinformational injury\u201d fails in any event. The\n\n        states never dispute that informational injury only suffices when it\n\n        causes \u201c\u2018real\u2019\u201d harms that \u201care of the type that have \u2018traditionally been\n\n        regarded as providing a basis for a lawsuit in English or American\n\n        courts.\u2019\u201d Dreher v. Experian Info. Sols., Inc., 856 F.3d 337, 345 (4th Cir.\n\n        2017) (quoting Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 578 U.S. 330, 340, 341 (2016)); see\n\n        also Resp. 15-16 (conceding the point). The states\u2019 asserted downstream\n\n        harms of \u201cdecreased tax revenue,\u201d \u201cincreased reliance on state social\n\n\n                                               3\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 39      Filed: 04/07/2025   Pg: 6 of 15\n\n\n\n\n        service programs,\u201d \u201csurges in unemployment claims,\u201d \u201cdisruptions to\n\n        state programs depending on federal workers,\u201d and costs from providing\n\n        other resources to terminated employees, see Resp. 16, are not\n\n        cognizable Article III injuries-in-fact, United States v. Texas, 599 U.S.\n\n        670, 680 n.3 (2023).\n\n              Other than an irrelevant citation to a case about tax penalties and\n\n        the Bankruptcy Code, see In re Yahweh Ctr., Inc., 27 F.4th 960 (4th Cir.\n\n        2022), cited in Resp. 17, the states\u2019 only attempt to distinguish Texas is\n\n        their assertion that their injuries derive from their \u201cstatutory right to\n\n        advanced notice.\u201d Resp. 17. Yet the states\u2019 articulation of a statutory\n\n        basis for their claims cannot solve their problem under Article III,\n\n        which \u201crequires a concrete injury even in the context of a statutory\n\n        violation.\u201d Spokeo, 578 U.S. at 341; see also TransUnion, LLC v.\n\n        Ramirez, 594 U.S. 413, 426 (2021) (\u201cCongress\u2019s creation of a statutory\n\n        prohibition or obligation and a cause of action does not relieve courts of\n\n        their responsibility to independently decide whether a plaintiff has\n\n        suffered a concrete harm under Article III \u2026 .\u201d).\n\n\n\n\n                                              4\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 39      Filed: 04/07/2025   Pg: 7 of 15\n\n\n\n\n                   2.    Civil Service Reform Act Channeling\n\n              The district court\u2019s order compelling the government to reinstate\n\n        thousands of terminated federal employees flouted the exclusive\n\n        remedial scheme created by the Civil Service Reform Act and the\n\n        Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute. The states\u2019 only\n\n        real defense of the district court\u2019s holding is to observe that Congress\n\n        did not provide states an opportunity to challenge federal employees\u2019\n\n        terminations, see Resp. 19, but that is exactly the point: in authorizing\n\n        challenges to employment decisions only by unions, employees, and\n\n        applicants for employment, Congress deliberately denied review to\n\n        anyone else. See Block v. Community Nutrition Inst., 467 U.S. 340\n\n        (1984); United States v. Fausto, 484 U.S. 439 (1988). The states thus\n\n        plainly fall within a \u201cclass\u201d of parties consciously denied the opportunity\n\n        to seek review of federal employees\u2019 terminations. Cf. Resp. 19 (quoting\n\n        Koretoff v. Vilsack, 614 F.3d 532, 536 (D.C. Cir. 2010)).\n\n              The states\u2019 attempt to distinguish Block fails. See Resp. 20. They\n\n        observe that the statutory scheme in Block did not permit \u201cparticipation\n\n        by consumers,\u201d id. (quoting Block, 467 U.S. at 347), but the same is true\n\n        of states here; no provision of the CSRA creates an \u201cexpress provision\n\n\n                                              5\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 39       Filed: 04/07/2025   Pg: 8 of 15\n\n\n\n\n        for participation\u201d by states, Block, 467 U.S. at 347. While federal law\n\n        requires notice to states of certain reductions in force, see Resp. 20, it\n\n        nowhere provides that states may enforce this notice obligation in either\n\n        an administrative or a judicial proceeding. And while plaintiffs attempt\n\n        to distance their claim from a \u201cgarden-variety employment claim[],\u201d id.,\n\n        their arguments confirm that at bottom they seek to challenge federal\n\n        personnel decisions. Indeed, the states offer no response to our\n\n        observation that the states are bringing the same claim, on the same\n\n        theory, seeking the same relief, that many terminated employees are\n\n        seeking themselves. See Mot. 22.\n\n              B.   The Government Did Not Conduct A Reduction\n                   In Force Requiring Notice To States.\n\n              Plaintiffs do not rehabilitate the district court\u2019s flawed conclusion\n\n        that agencies\u2019 terminations of probationary employees amounted to an\n\n        unannounced reduction in force. A reduction in force does not occur\n\n        whenever the government terminates a large number of employees. See\n\n        Mot. 23-25. Instead, the reduction in force regulations provide that\n\n        when an agency \u201cformally announce[s] a reduction in force,\u201d it may\n\n        eliminate \u201cpositions\u201d \u201cbecause of lack of work; shortage of funds;\n\n        insufficient personnel ceiling; reorganization; the exercise of\n\n                                               6\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 39     Filed: 04/07/2025   Pg: 9 of 15\n\n\n\n\n        reemployment rights or restoration rights; or reclassification of an\n\n        employee\u2019s position d[u]e to erosion of duties.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.201(a)(1)-\n\n        (2). Plaintiffs continue to observe that the government terminated a\n\n        significant number of probationary employees, see Mot. 11-15, but they\n\n        do not dispute our demonstration that a reduction in force did not occur\n\n        because the government did not eliminate positions pursuant to a\n\n        reorganization. Instead, the agencies simply elected to terminate\n\n        certain individuals. And as the states further acknowledge, those\n\n        terminations generally purported to be for cause. See Resp. 7.\n\n              The states\u2019 argument thus boils down to their belief that the\n\n        government did not actually have sufficient cause to terminate anyone.\n\n        See, e.g., Resp. 13 (suggesting that agencies were not \u201chonestly \u2026\n\n        dissatisfied\u201d with employees\u2019 performance (quotation marks omitted));\n\n        see also Resp. 8 n.2 (noting that some terminated employees had\n\n        recently obtained positive performance reviews). As the government\n\n        has observed, that would be a remarkable conclusion to reach in\n\n        litigation to which the affected employees are not parties, and the states\n\n        ignore the \u201cnumerous ways that the law treats probationary and non-\n\n        probationary employees differently.\u201d National Treasury Emps. Union v.\n\n\n                                             7\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 39      Filed: 04/07/2025   Pg: 10 of 15\n\n\n\n\n        Federal Labor Relations Auth., 737 F.3d 273, 277 (4th Cir. 2013). In\n\n        any case, the legality of any individual employee\u2019s termination under\n\n        the standards applicable to probationary employees is an entirely\n\n        distinct question from whether the government conducted a reduction\n\n        in force of which the states were entitled to notice. See Mot. 25. Even if\n\n        it were true that the government lacked sufficient cause to fire certain\n\n        probationary employees, that would not mean that the government had\n\n        conducted a reduction in force\u2014it would mean that the terminations\n\n        were unlawful, a claim that may be pursued by affected employees\n\n        under the mechanisms created by Congress.\n\n        II.   The Equitable Factors Favor A Stay.\n\n              Finally, the equitable factors favor a stay. As set out above, the\n\n        states do not suffer Article III injury when the federal government\n\n        terminates certain of their citizens\u2019 employment, see supra pp.1-4, let\n\n        alone irreparable harm sufficient to justify a preliminary injunction.\n\n        Nor do the states dispute that every day the injunction remains in\n\n        place, the government is obligated to continue paying thousands of\n\n        employees it had previously terminated, with no practical mechanism to\n\n        recoup those funds if it prevails on appeal\u2014a problem exacerbated by\n\n\n                                              8\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 39      Filed: 04/07/2025   Pg: 11 of 15\n\n\n\n\n        the district court\u2019s failure to require each plaintiff state to post more\n\n        than a nominal bond. As the Supreme Court just confirmed last week,\n\n        such considerations counsel in favor of a stay. See Department of Educ.\n\n        v. California, No. 24A910, 2025 WL 1008354 (U.S. Apr. 4, 2025) (per\n\n        curiam) (granting stay of preliminary injunction where \u201crespondents\n\n        have not refuted the Government\u2019s representation that it is unlikely to\n\n        recover the grant funds once they are disbursed\u201d and \u201cthe District Court\n\n        declined to impose bond\u201d).\n\n              The states\u2019 attempt to invoke injuries to the employees\n\n        themselves, see Resp. 21-22, is unavailing. Those individuals are not\n\n        parties to this action, and indeed the district court has suggested that\n\n        there is not even an \u201cidentity of interests between the States and the\n\n        fired employees.\u201d Dkt. No. 125 at 37. And as our motion explained,\n\n        many of those employees are endeavoring to pursue their own claims\n\n        pursuant to the statutory scheme that Congress enacted.1\n\n\n\n              1 The states observe that the district court\u2019s order permits\n\n        defendants to \u201cmove forward with legitimate RIFs during the pendency\n        of this case, so long as they follow the proper procedures.\u201d Resp. 23.\n        That may be, but neither federal personnel law nor the U.S.\n        Constitution contemplates that the legality of any employee\u2019s\n        termination\u2014whether the terminations at issue here, or any future RIF\n                                                                  Continued on next page.\n                                              9\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 39      Filed: 04/07/2025   Pg: 12 of 15\n\n\n\n\n              Finally, the states observe that the government has been in\n\n        compliance with the temporary restraining order for several weeks,\n\n        such that staying the preliminary injunction could \u201cdisrupt the status\n\n        quo\u201d by leading to additional terminations. Mot. 22. But while it is\n\n        true that the government made enormous efforts to comply with the\n\n        temporary restraining order by reinstating affected employees, the\n\n        district court\u2019s entry of a legally erroneous temporary restraining order\n\n        (followed by a legally erroneous preliminary injunction) is a reason for\n\n        this Court to correct the district court\u2019s errors\u2014not to compound them.\n\n        The best way to provide certainty for the federal government, the\n\n        states, and the employees themselves is for this Court to confirm that\n\n        this case should never have been in federal court in the first place.\n\n\n\n\n        that an agency might execute\u2014will be subject to the continuing\n        jurisdiction of a federal district court at the behest of state\n        governments.\n                                              10\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 39    Filed: 04/07/2025   Pg: 13 of 15\n\n\n\n\n                                   CONCLUSION\n\n              The Court should stay the preliminary injunction pending appeal.\n\n                                                Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                                YAAKOV M.

Here, issuing a stay would do exactly the opposite\u2014it would\n\n        abruptly terminate the employment of thousands of public servants through no fault\n\n        of their own. And it would again plunge the Appellee States into chaos by straining\n\n        their unemployment and public benefit systems and leaving them scrambling to\n\n        comply with federal statutory mandates. That harm contrasts sharply with the cost\n\n        to the Appellant Agencies of abiding by the district court\u2019s carefully crafted\n\n        injunction, which simply requires them to comply with federal notice requirements\n\n        before engaging in mass terminations that directly harm the Appellee States. The\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248     Doc: 36        Filed: 04/07/2025    Pg: 2 of 31\n\n\n\n\n        equities of this case are straightforward. So is the law governing mass terminations.\n\n        Neither law nor equity justifies a stay.\n\n              The district court issued a preliminary injunction after finding that the\n\n        Agencies flagrantly violated a congressional command requiring warnings to States\n\n        before mass terminations. Without providing notice to the States, the Agencies\n\n        recently terminated over 24,000 probationary employees through unlawful\n\n        reductions in force (\u201cRIFs\u201d). States were left to handle an unanticipated spike in\n\n        unemployment insurance claims and increased demand for public services\u2014the very\n\n        harms that advance warning is intended to ameliorate. Recognizing that the\n\n        Agencies\u2019 conduct was forbidden by clear statutory and regulatory text, the district\n\n        court maintained the status quo ante by preliminarily enjoining the Agencies from\n\n        continuing their string of unlawful mass firings and reinstating the terminated\n\n        employees.\n\n              The Agencies fail to satisfy any of the criteria for the extraordinary relief they\n\n        seek. When federal agencies engage in mass terminations, they must follow\n\n        statutorily prescribed RIF procedures, including giving States notice that enables\n\n        them to deploy federally mandated support services to help employees locate new\n\n        jobs before they are unemployed. Here, the Agencies abruptly terminated thousands\n\n        of employees without warning, resulting in significant irreparable injury. Those\n\n        injuries, combined with the lack of legally required notice, give the States standing\n\n                                                   2\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248     Doc: 36        Filed: 04/07/2025    Pg: 3 of 31\n\n\n\n\n        to sue. And the violation of the States\u2019 clear statutory right is subject to judicial\n\n        review. The Agencies\u2019 contrary contention\u2014that States lack any recourse\u2014is a\n\n        novel assertion that contravenes basic Article III principles.\n\n              Further, the balance of the equities and the public interest cut firmly against a\n\n        stay. There is no public interest in unlawful government action. Nor should the\n\n        States have to shoulder the administrative burden of locating, supporting, and\n\n        processing unemployment benefits claims made by thousands of unlawfully\n\n        terminated employees while the Agencies gut the federal workforce without\n\n        following the requisite procedures. Moreover, with the probationary employees now\n\n        reinstated for nearly three weeks, the parties have returned to their last uncontested\n\n        status, which a stay would disrupt. A stay is especially unwarranted here, where the\n\n        injunction covers only the Appellee States and still permits for-cause terminations\n\n        and lawfully executed RIFs. The motion for a stay should be denied.\n\n\n                                    STATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\n              Legal Framework\n\n                     Termination of Probationary Employees\n\n              New employees and certain employees who have changed offices or received\n\n        promotions are subject to probationary periods. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7511(a)(1); 5 C.F.R.\n\n        \u00a7 315.801.

Price, Trump Administration Begins\n\n        Sweeping Layoffs with Probationary Workers, Warns of Larger Cuts to Come,\n\n        Associated Press (Feb. 13, 2025), tinyurl.com/mtzwfc6j.          OPM reiterated that\n\n        demand a day later and drafted a template termination letter for the Agencies to send\n\n        to their probationary employees, informing the employees that their removal was\n\n        \u201cbased on [their] performance.\u201d (ECF 78-4, CHCO Email, at 4.) The Agencies\n\n        obeyed, firing over 24,000 probationary employees as of the filing of the complaint.\n\n        (ECF 1, Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 102-40.) Each termination occurred without notice to the States.\n\n              In carrying out the terminations, the Agencies largely relied on OPM\u2019s\n\n        template language, which stated that the employees were being terminated because\n\n        their \u201cability, knowledge and skills do not fit the Agency\u2019s current needs, and [their]\n\n        performance has not been adequate to justify further employment.\u201d (ECF 33-2,\n\n        Redacted Decl. \u00b6 5; DiMartini Decl. \u00b6 13.)\n\n              These terminations were not based on individualized findings regarding the\n\n        employees\u2019 performance.

(DiMartini Decl. \u00b6 14; ECF 4-36, Grant Decl.\n\n        \u00b6 19.) Some termination letters even stated that the employee was being terminated\n\n        \u201cper OPM instructions.\u201d      (ECF 78-10, Schwarz Decl. \u00b6 10.)         In response to\n\n        unemployment claims, several agencies represented that the terminations were due\n\n        to a \u201creduction in force\u201d or a \u201cpermanent lack of work due to a change in Presidential\n\n        Administration.\u201d (Maryland Labor Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 61-62.) One agency\u2019s termination\n\n        email even instructed employees to \u201cdirect [their] inquiries to rif@gsa.gov.\u201d (ECF\n\n        No. 78-12, GSA Email, at 2.)\n\n                     Spikes in Unemployment and Demand for Public Services\n\n              In the wake of these mass terminations, many States have seen significant\n\n        increases in the number of unemployment claims filed by former federal employees.\n\n        (See, e.g., Maryland Labor Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 18, 50, 52 (30-60 claims per day, 330%\n\n        increase); ECF 4-11, New Jersey Labor Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 14-15 (273%); ECF 4-7, California\n\n\n\n\n              2\n                Many employees purportedly terminated for performance had recently\n        received stellar reviews.

(See, e.g., Maryland Labor Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 16, 19-23; ECF 4-11, New Jersey\n\n        Labor Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 16-18.) Some diverted staff from pressing projects to retrain them to\n\n        provide rapid response services. (See, e.g., Maryland Labor Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 24-28.) Others\n\n        created new websites or set up dedicated phone lines to find and assist terminated\n\n        federal employees.     (See, e.g., Maryland Labor Decl. \u00b6 29; ECF 4-8, Illinois\n\n        Employment Decl. \u00b6 32; ECF 4-7, California Employment Decl. \u00b6 19.) The States\n\n        still do not know exactly how many probationary employees were terminated in each\n\n        geographic area, or by what agency those employees were terminated.\n\n              Procedural History\n\n              On March 6, 2025, the States filed suit to challenge the mass termination of\n\n        probationary employees without following RIF procedures. The next day, the States\n\n        requested that the district court temporarily restrain further unlawful terminations of\n\n        probationary employees, reinstate probationary employees unlawfully terminated,\n\n        and that the Agencies provide information to the States and district court in regular\n\n        status reports. (ECF 4-1, at 3\u20114.) The district court subsequently granted the States\u2019\n\n                                                  9\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248     Doc: 36        Filed: 04/07/2025    Pg: 10 of 31\n\n\n\n\n        motion for a temporary restraining order (\u201cTRO\u201d) on a nationwide basis as to all but\n\n        three defendants.3\n\n              The Agencies requested a stay of the TRO in this Court, which was denied.\n\n        That same day, they filed a status report stating that they rescinded many of the\n\n        terminations and acknowledging that almost all the terminations were not due to\n\n        performance. (See, e.g., ECF 52-1, at 14 (explaining that Department of Homeland\n\n        Security\u2019s report of 313 probationary employee terminations \u201cexcludes [those]\n\n        terminated in individualized actions based on their performance\u201d); ECF 52-1, at 18\n\n        n.1 (similar); ECF 52-1, at 44 (similar).)\n\n              On April 1, the district court granted the States\u2019 motion for a preliminary\n\n        injunction with respect to all but one defendant. It narrowed the relief to apply \u201conly\n\n        with respect to employees who live or work in Plaintiff States.\u201d (ECF 125, at 70.)\n\n        The injunction does not prevent the Agencies from terminating employees for\n\n        individualized cause or from conducting future RIFs, provided that they follow\n\n        lawful procedures. (ECF 126, at \u00b6 3.) The district court denied the Agencies\u2019\n\n        subsequent motion for a stay (ECF 134), and the Agencies filed an appeal and again\n\n        seek a stay from this Court.\n\n\n\n\n              3\n                The district court excluded the Department of Defense, the National\n        Archives and Records Administration, and OPM from the TRO without prejudice.\n        (ECF 43, at 39.)\n                                                     10\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248     Doc: 36         Filed: 04/07/2025   Pg: 11 of 31\n\n\n\n\n                                            ARGUMENT\n\n              A stay pending appeal is \u201can exercise of judicial discretion,\u201d and \u201cnot a matter\n\n        of right, even if irreparable injury might otherwise result.\u201d Nken v.

Because the Agencies did not\n\n        provide the requisite notice, these RIFs were unlawful and cannot stand. The\n\n        Agencies have not made a strong showing to the contrary.\n\n              The Agencies contend that the Court is required to treat the mass terminations\n\n        as if they were based on performance simply because most termination letters say\n\n        that the employees were fired for cause.

Here,\n\n        the Agencies\u2019 contention that they evaluated performance is overwhelmingly refuted\n\n        by the evidence, including:\n\n              \u2022 OPM\u2019s directive to terminate, not evaluate, probationary employees\n                (DiMartini Decl. \u00b6 5);\n\n              \u2022 Declarations of agency officials stating that individual assessments were\n                not undertaken (Grant Decl. \u00b6 19; DiMartini Decl. \u00b6 16);\n\n              \u2022 Employee declarations documenting exemplary evaluations shortly before\n                termination, see note 2 above;\n\n              \u2022 The Agencies\u2019 admission that many employees were terminated due to a\n                \u201creduction in force\u201d (Maryland Labor Decl. \u00b6 62);\n\n              \u2022 \u201cThe sheer number of employees that were terminated in a matter of\n                days,\u201d\u2014more than 24,000\u2014the district court determined, \u201cbelies any\n\n\n                                                12\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248    Doc: 36       Filed: 04/07/2025    Pg: 13 of 31\n\n\n\n\n                 argument that these terminations were due to the employees\u2019 individual\n                 unsatisfactory performance or conduct\u201d (ECF 43, at 33);\n\n              \u2022 The Agencies\u2019 declarations confirming that hundreds of employees were\n                not \u201cterminated in individualized actions based on their performance\u201d\n                (ECF 52-1 at 14, 18 & n.1, 44);\n\n              \u2022 Termination letters that expressly stated that firings were pursuant to\n                applicable \u201ccivil service RIF regulations\u201d (ECF 78-10, Schwartz Decl. at\n                \u00b6 17); and\n\n              \u2022 Agency communications instructing terminated employees to \u201cdirect\n                [their] inquiries to rif@gsa.gov,\u201d (ECF 78-12, GSA Email, at 2).\n\n              To terminate probationary employees for unsatisfactory performance,\n\n        employers \u201cmust honestly be dissatisfied with the probationer\u2019s conduct or\n\n        performance after giving him a fair trial on the job.\u201d McGuffin, 942 F.3d at 1102\n\n        (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks omitted). That is plainly not what\n\n        happened here. The Agencies cannot rely on the procedures governing for-cause\n\n        terminations when those terminations were not undertaken for cause.\n\n              Instead, the Agencies were required to follow RIF procedures under binding\n\n        OPM regulations. RIF procedures must be used when an agency separates an\n\n        employee due to \u201clack of work,\u201d \u201cshortage of funds,\u201d or \u201creorganization,\u201d among\n\n        other things.   5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.201(a)(2).    As the district court recognized, the\n\n        Agencies\u2019 \u201cown briefing . . . indicates that these terminations were RIFs,\u201d\n\n        undertaken for exactly those reasons. (ECF 125 at 47; see ECF 101, at 20-21.)\n\n        Moreover, in responses to unemployment reports, some Agencies explained that\n\n                                                13\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248    Doc: 36        Filed: 04/07/2025   Pg: 14 of 31\n\n\n\n\n        terminations were effectuated due to a \u201creduction in force\u201d or because of \u201cpermanent\n\n        lack of work.\u201d (Maryland Labor Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 61-62.) And the Administration has\n\n        publicly explained its own actions by opining that \u201c[t]here are too many federal\n\n        employees\u201d and salaries \u201ccontribute[] significantly to federal spending and debt.\u201d\n\n        See The White House, Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Works to Remake\n\n        America\u2019s Federal Workforce (Feb. 11, 2025), tinyurl.com/3tfbpxwc. The federal\n\n        government may be entitled to terminate some employees for these reasons, but it\n\n        must still follow RIF procedures.\n\n              The Agencies counter that, because they did not label the terminations as\n\n        RIFs, and because they did not take even the most preliminary steps toward\n\n        complying with the applicable statutes and regulations (for example, by eliminating\n\n        the relevant positions rather than merely firing employees), the terminations were\n\n        somehow not RIFs. Mot. 25. As the district court correctly recognized, that \u201chas it\n\n        backwards.\u201d (ECF 125, at 48.) The existence of a RIF turns not on whether the\n\n        Agencies complied with statutorily mandated procedures, but rather on whether they\n\n        conducted mass terminations due to a lack of work, a shortage of funds, or part of a\n\n        reorganization\u2014\u201cregardless of what label the [Agencies] attach[] to the actions.\u201d\n\n        (ECF 125, at 48.) To conclude otherwise would reward the Agencies for their\n\n        noncompliance, or worse yet, for intentionally flouting the law.\n\n\n\n\n                                                14\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248      Doc: 36         Filed: 04/07/2025     Pg: 15 of 31\n\n\n\n\n              As the district court concluded, \u201cthese were indeed RIFs.\u201d (ECF 125, at 49.)\n\n        And the Agencies have never disputed that they are required to provide advance\n\n        notice to states to conduct such RIFs. See Mot. 5. Yet they failed to comply with\n\n        these clear requirements. Because the Agencies\u2019 legal violations are clear and\n\n        obvious, they have no likelihood of success on the merits. See CASA, Inc. v. Trump,\n\n        No. 25-1153, 2025 WL 654902, at *1 (4th Cir. Feb. 28, 2025) (denying stay request\n\n        for failure to make \u201cstrong showing\u201d of likelihood of success given that \u201ccircuit\n\n        precedent foreclose[d] the government\u2019s position\u201d).\n\n              B.     The States Have Standing.\n\n              The district court correctly concluded that each State has Article III standing.\n\n        To establish standing, a State must show \u201c(i) that [it] has suffered or likely will suffer\n\n        an injury in fact, (ii) that the injury likely was caused . . . by the defendant, and (iii)\n\n        that the injury likely would be redressed by the requested judicial relief.\u201d FDA v.\n\n        Alliance for Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. 367, 380 (2024). Here, the States asserted\n\n        a direct injury based on the Agencies\u2019 failure to provide advance notice under the\n\n        RIF statutes and regulations. The Agencies\u2019 claim to the contrary does not come\n\n        close to the \u201cstrong showing\u201d needed to grant a stay. See Nken, 556 U.S. at 434.\n\n              The States\u2019 injury is an informational one that has caused specific concrete\n\n        harms. Under black-letter law, an informational injury can constitute an injury in\n\n        fact when there is a \u201clack [of] access to information to which [one] is legally entitled\u201d\n\n                                                    15\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248     Doc: 36       Filed: 04/07/2025    Pg: 16 of 31\n\n\n\n\n        and \u201cthe denial of that information creates a real harm with an adverse effect.\u201d\n\n        Dreher v. Experian Info. Solutions, Inc., 856 F.3d 337, 345 (4th Cir. 2017). Here,\n\n        the record is replete with evidence supporting both of those requirements.\n\n              Congress granted the States the statutory right to certain information in\n\n        advance of mass firings to avoid a predictable harm to states and localities. See 5\n\n        U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d)(3). As a consequence of the lack of warning, the States have\n\n        suffered specific harms, including (1) costs from the hasty rollout of rapid-response\n\n        protocols; (2) burdens associated with processing unanticipated surges in\n\n        unemployment claims; (3) sudden disruptions to state programs depending on\n\n        federal workers; and (4) unexpected financial harms from decreased tax revenue and\n\n        increased reliance on state social service programs. (ECF 125, at 9-16.) Contrary\n\n        to the Agencies\u2019 assertion, Mot. 16-17, the States still lack information as to the\n\n        unlawfully terminated employees. But even if that were not so, the Agencies miss\n\n        the point: the States were not just entitled to information, but to advance warning,\n\n        the absence of which caused irreparable harm.\n\n              Notwithstanding the States\u2019 clear entitlement to notice and the myriad harms\n\n        caused by the unwarned terminations, the Agencies continue to claim that United\n\n        States v. Texas, 599 U.S. 670 (2023), \u201csquarely foreclose[s]\u201d Article III standing.\n\n        Mot. 14. Not so. Texas had nothing to do with informational injuries caused by\n\n        noncompliance with a statute that entitled plaintiffs to notice.     Instead, Texas\n\n                                                 16\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248     Doc: 36        Filed: 04/07/2025    Pg: 17 of 31\n\n\n\n\n        involved a state\u2019s challenge to the federal government\u2019s enforcement priorities\n\n        regarding third parties. In that context, the state\u2019s follow-on harms from non-\n\n        enforcement were indeed attenuated and peripheral. See Mot. 14. But invoking\n\n        Texas here is attempting to \u201ccram[] a square peg into a round hole.\u201d In re Yahweh\n\n        Ctr., Inc., 27 F.4th 960, 968 (4th Cir. 2022). The States have experienced a violation\n\n        of a specific statutory right to advanced notice, resulting in concrete injuries. And\n\n        those pocketbook harms and resource strains are exactly the sort of harms Congress\n\n        meant to forestall by requiring warnings before mass terminations. They are\n\n        anything but \u201cperipheral.\u201d Compare Laufer v. Naranda Hotels, LLC, 60 F.4th 156,\n\n        170-71 (4th Cir. 2023) (recognizing Article III injury from the deprivation of\n\n        information required to be disclosed by statute), with TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez,\n\n        594 U.S. 413, 442 (2021) (finding no standing where \u201c[a]n asserted informational\n\n        injury . . . causes no adverse effects\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\n           C.      The States\u2019 Claims Are Not Subject to Administrative Channeling.\n\n                Contrary to the Agencies\u2019 contentions, neither the Federal Service Labor-\n\n        Management Relations Statute nor the Civil Service Reform Act (\u201cCSRA\u201d)\n\n        precludes jurisdiction. See Mot. 18-23. The Agencies ask this Court to be the first\n\n        in the country to endorse an extraordinary expansion of the implied channeling\n\n        doctrine that would leave States with effectively no judicial review and no remedy\n\n        at all. The Court should decline this invitation.\n\n                                                  17\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248     Doc: 36        Filed: 04/07/2025   Pg: 18 of 31\n\n\n\n\n              Any jurisdictional analysis must start with \u201cthe strong presumption in favor\n\n        of judicial review\u201d that can be overcome only by \u201cclear and convincing indications\n\n        that Congress meant to foreclose review.\u201d SAS Inst., Inc. v. Iancu, 584 U.S. 357,\n\n        370 (2018) (internal quotation marks omitted); cf. Axon Enter., Inc. v. FTC, 598 U.S.\n\n        175, 207 (2023) (Gorsuch, J., concurring) (questioning courts\u2019 \u201cauthority to engage\n\n        in this business of jurisdiction-stripping-by-implication\u201d). This presumption has\n\n        special force in the APA context. See Sackett v. EPA, 566 U.S. 120, 129 (2012).\n\n              To overcome this presumption, the Agencies must satisfy the two-step\n\n        framework from Thunder Basin Coal Co. v. Reich, 510 U.S. 200 (1994). Under that\n\n        framework, a court first asks \u201cwhether Congress\u2019s intent to preclude district-court\n\n        jurisdiction is fairly discernible in the statutory scheme.\u201d Bennett v. SEC, 844 F.3d\n\n        174, 181 (4th Cir. 2016) (internal quotation marks omitted). It next asks \u201cwhether\n\n        plaintiffs\u2019 claims are of the type Congress intended to be reviewed within this\n\n        statutory structure,\u201d considering whether (1) \u201cthe statutory scheme foreclose[s] all\n\n        meaningful judicial review,\u201d (2) \u201cthe extent to which the plaintiff\u2019s claims are\n\n        wholly collateral to the statute\u2019s review provisions,\u201d and (3) \u201cwhether agency\n\n        expertise could be brought to bear on the . . . questions presented.\u201d Id. (alterations\n\n        in original) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201c[M]eaningful judicial review is the\n\n        most important factor.\u201d Id. at 183 n.7.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  18\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248     Doc: 36        Filed: 04/07/2025     Pg: 19 of 31\n\n\n\n\n              Application of this framework confirms that the district court had jurisdiction.\n\n        At step one, the CSRA\u2019s \u201ctext, structure, and purpose\u201d do not display a \u201cfairly\n\n        discernible\u201d intent to limit jurisdiction over the States\u2019 claims. Elgin v. Dep\u2019t of\n\n        Treasury, 567 U.S. 1, 10 (2012). The CSRA\u2019s administrative tribunals\u2014the Merit\n\n        Systems Protection Board and the Federal Labor Relations Authority\u2014are available\n\n        only to employees, unions, and employers. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7103(a)(1)-(2), 7123, 7703.\n\n        Yet States have clear statutory rights to notice, making it illogical to conclude that\n\n        Congress intended CSRA preclusion to encompass suits like this one. See Koretoff\n\n        v. Vilsack, 614 F.3d 532, 536 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (no preclusion where Congress did\n\n        not foreclose \u201creview to the class to which the plaintiff belongs\u201d (alterations omitted)\n\n        (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\n              Even if this Court were to proceed to step two, the CSRA still would not\n\n        preclude this suit. If the district court lacked jurisdiction, the States would be\n\n        stripped of meaningful judicial review. And their claims about notice are \u201cwholly\n\n        collateral\u201d to the CSRA\u2019s administrative review scheme, Thunder Basin, 510 U.S.\n\n        at 212 (internal quotation marks omitted), because notice to States has \u201cnothing to\n\n        do with\u201d the labor-related matters that the administrative tribunals \u201cregularly\n\n        adjudicate[]\u201d between employees, unions, and employers, Axon, 598 U.S. at 193\n\n        (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted). Lastly, the administrative\n\n        tribunals specialize in individualized adjudications of prototypical employee\n\n                                                  19\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248     Doc: 36         Filed: 04/07/2025    Pg: 20 of 31\n\n\n\n\n        disputes and lack the expertise to handle the States\u2019 claims\u2014i.e., that the Agencies\n\n        are indiscriminately targeting a swath of the federal workforce to gut the civil service\n\n        without warning the States.\n\n              The Agencies\u2019 reliance on cases involving ordinary employment disputes\n\n        between employees, unions, and employers is misguided. See Mot. 20-21. Unlike\n\n        the plaintiff in United States v. Fausto, 484 U.S. 439 (1988), the States are not\n\n        asserting garden-variety employment claims but, rather, are challenging the\n\n        Agencies\u2019 failure to provide them with statutorily required notice, which is not \u201cthe\n\n        type of personnel action covered by\u201d the CSRA. Id. at 448. Block v. Community\n\n        Nutrition Institute, 467 U.S. 340 (1984), is similarly inapposite. Predating Thunder\n\n        Basin, Block concerned a statutory scheme that allowed milk producers and handlers\n\n        to participate in the adoption of milk market orders, but \u201c[n]owhere in the Act\u201d\n\n        permitted \u201cparticipation by consumers.\u201d Block, 467 U.S. at 347. The Court\n\n        concluded that consumers, having no statutory rights, could not seek judicial review.\n\n        In contrast, Congress expressly conferred the right to notice to the States, and thus\n\n        did not \u201cintend[] to foreclose\u201d their ability to vindicate that right. Id. Similarly,\n\n        allowing the States\u2019 claims to move forward would not \u201cleave a gaping hole in the\n\n        CSRA.\u201d Mot. 23. The States have a clear statutory right yet are not encompassed\n\n        in the CSRA\u2019s administrative-review scheme\u2014making them differently situated\n\n        from employees, unions, or run-of-the-mill third parties.\n\n                                                  20\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248     Doc: 36        Filed: 04/07/2025   Pg: 21 of 31\n\n\n\n\n        II.   THE EQUITABLE FACTORS DO NOT FAVOR A STAY.\n\n              Staying the preliminary injunction would \u201csubstantially injure\u201d both the\n\n        States, which are responsible for providing rapid response services, and \u201cthe other\n\n        parties interested in the proceeding\u201d\u2014namely, the thousands of probationary\n\n        employees. See Nken, 556 U.S. at 426. Those employees are now back with their\n\n        agencies in accordance with the parties\u2019 last uncontested status. The district court\u2019s\n\n        carefully crafted preliminary injunction properly maintains the status quo ante for a\n\n        limited subset of probationary employees\u2014those \u201c[w]hose duty station . . . and/or\n\n        residence is in one of\u201d the States. (ECF 126, at 4.) Upending the injunction would\n\n        cause significant disruption, reinstituting the same chaos that preceded the TRO and\n\n        triggering a new wave of unemployment and benefits claims.\n\n              Maintaining the injunction is plainly in the public interest. See Roe v.\n\n        Department of Def., 947 F.3d 207, 230-31 (4th Cir. 2020). As the district court\n\n        recognized, the Agencies\u2019 unwarned mass terminations caused \u201ctemporal and\n\n        immediate\u201d damage (ECF 125, at 64) tied to the States\u2019 legal obligations to provide\n\n        rapid response services and provide benefits to their residents (ECF 125, at 15-18).\n\n        Indeed, each day that probationary employees are unemployed creates rising and\n\n        likely unrecoverable costs for the States, including \u201csubstantial\u201d \u201cmoney damages\u201d\n\n        and the diversion of \u201cresources and personnel to accommodate the shifting\n\n        employment-response landscape.\u201d (ECF 125, at 63.) The Agencies\u2019 suggestion that\n\n                                                 21\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248     Doc: 36         Filed: 04/07/2025    Pg: 22 of 31\n\n\n\n\n        preliminary relief is unjustified because terminated employees \u201cmay obtain back\n\n        pay,\u201d Mot. 27, ignores the nature of this suit. Back pay to employees alone would\n\n        not redress injuries to the States. As the Agencies themselves repeatedly argued,\n\n        \u201cthe only way the States could be made whole was by reinstatement.\u201d (ECF 125, at\n\n        65 (citing ECF 20, at 14, 17).)\n\n              For terminated probationary employees, the injuries that would result from a\n\n        stay are profound now that the parties have largely returned to the status quo ante.\n\n        It has been nearly three weeks since the Agencies first reinstated thousands of\n\n        probationary employees\u2014which the district court deemed \u201cmeaningful progress\n\n        towards compliance with the TRO\u201d (ECF 72, at 1)\u2014and almost two weeks since the\n\n        Agencies represented having \u201cachieved substantial compliance\u201d (ECF 103, at 3). A\n\n        stay would disrupt this status quo ante and prompt another unanticipated round of\n\n        mass terminations, once again leaving thousands of blameless public servants in the\n\n        lurch. That is neither equitable nor in the public interest.\n\n              Any harm to the Agencies pales in comparison, especially considering the\n\n        district court\u2019s tailored injunction. The Agencies identify only two purported harms.\n\n        First, they contend that having to \u201ccontinue employing individuals whose services\n\n        [an agency] no longer requires\u201d irreparably injures the government. Mot. 26. But\n\n        reviving established employment relationships with employees who were only\n\n        recently separated imposes relatively modest burdens. See League of Women Voters\n\n                                                  22\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248      Doc: 36        Filed: 04/07/2025    Pg: 23 of 31\n\n\n\n\n        of N.C. v. North Carolina, 769 F.3d 224, 248 (4th Cir. 2014) (finding burden on\n\n        government to restore status quo was lessened because relevant \u201csystems have\n\n        existed, do exist, and simply need to be resurrected\u201d). And having to employ\n\n        individuals whose services are ostensibly no longer required for a brief period\u2014\n\n        generally 60 days to provide notice\u2014is exactly what the RIF procedures require.\n\n        That may be some constraint on the Agencies\u2019 \u201cinternal affairs,\u201d but it is hardly\n\n        irreparable harm. Mot. 26. Indeed, the Agencies seemingly ignore that the district\n\n        court permitted them to move forward with legitimate RIFs during the pendency of\n\n        this case, so long as they follow the proper procedures and give the States statutorily\n\n        required notice.\n\n              Second, the Agencies assert that \u201cthe government will never be able to recover\n\n        the salaries that it is being ordered to continue paying.\u201d Mot. 26. But the Agencies\n\n        ignore that they would have had to cover costs for such salaries if they had followed\n\n        the requisite RIF procedures, by continuing to employ probationary employees\n\n        through the 60-day notice period to the States. In any event, the district court tailored\n\n        its preliminary injunction to cover only probationary employees who work or reside\n\n        in the Plaintiff States. (ECF 126.) By contrast, the effect of a stay on the States\n\n        would be massive. It would resurrect the harms that prompted this action, forcing\n\n        the States to once again scramble to aid residents in finding new jobs or accessing\n\n        public benefits.\n\n                                                   23\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248    Doc: 36       Filed: 04/07/2025   Pg: 24 of 31\n\n\n\n\n                                        CONCLUSION\n\n              The motion for a stay should be denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                               24\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248    Doc: 36        Filed: 04/07/2025   Pg: 25 of 31\n\n\n\n\n                                                   Respectfully submitted,\n\n         KEITH ELLISON                             ANTHONY G.

That injunction follows a\n\n        temporary restraining order the district court previously entered\n\n        requiring similar relief. This relief would be extraordinary under any\n\n        circumstances. It is all the more extraordinary here, where the court\n\n        acted at the behest of several states\u2014but not even one affected\n\n        employee\u2014to redress the purported violation of a notice requirement.\n\n              This Court should stay the injunction pending appeal. The\n\n        district court lacked jurisdiction to superintend the federal\n\n        government\u2019s employment relationships at the behest of states that are\n\n        strangers to those relationships. The states lack Article III standing to\n\n        complain of downstream economic effects caused by the government\u2019s\n\n        employment actions, and the district court\u2019s attempt to repackage\n\n        plaintiffs\u2019 injuries as \u201cinformational\u201d is a dead end. Indeed, there is no\n\n        connection between the purported informational injury the states assert\n\n        and the sweeping reinstatement remedy the district court ordered.\n\n        Moreover, Congress has channeled all federal employment disputes into\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 34      Filed: 04/04/2025   Pg: 4 of 194\n\n\n\n\n        an administrative process with judicial review in the Federal Circuit.\n\n        Allowing states to circumvent that process would upend that reticulated\n\n        statutory scheme and contravene Supreme Court precedent recognizing\n\n        that where an exclusive remedial scheme permits claims by only a\n\n        particular class of plaintiffs, it shuts the door to claims by anyone else.\n\n              The district court\u2019s merits analysis was no sounder. Under federal\n\n        law, a probationary employee may be terminated, among other reasons,\n\n        upon an agency\u2019s determination that the employee has \u201cfail[ed] to\n\n        demonstrate fully his or her qualifications for continued employment.\u201d\n\n        5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.803(a). The district court believed that the government\n\n        had not identified sufficient cause for terminating any probationary\n\n        employees\u2014itself a remarkable conclusion to reach in litigation to\n\n        which the employees are not parties\u2014but it did not stop there. Instead,\n\n        the district court reasoned that since the government did not have\n\n        sufficient cause for firing these employees, it must have actually\n\n        conducted a reduction in force (RIF), a specific type of personnel\n\n        procedure that may require advance notice to states, see 5 U.S.C.\n\n        \u00a7 3502(d). But even if the court were correct that the government\n\n        lacked sufficient cause to fire probationary employees, that would not\n\n\n                                              2\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 34      Filed: 04/04/2025   Pg: 5 of 194\n\n\n\n\n        mean the government had conducted RIFs\u2014it would just mean that the\n\n        probationary employees could challenge their terminations through the\n\n        mechanisms created by Congress, as indeed some employees are\n\n        endeavoring to do.\n\n              The remaining stay factors overwhelmingly favor the government.\n\n        The court\u2019s order represents an extraordinary incursion on the\n\n        Executive Branch\u2019s authority to manage its workforce. The preliminary\n\n        injunction requires the government to retain and pay employees whose\n\n        services it has determined it no longer requires, and there is no\n\n        mechanism for the government to recoup those salaries if it eventually\n\n        prevails in this appeal\u2014particularly given the district court\u2019s failure to\n\n        require the states to post more than nominal $100 bonds. On the other\n\n        side of the ledger, the states do not suffer any cognizable harm (let\n\n        alone irreparable harm) from the federal government\u2019s determination\n\n        that it no longer wishes to employ certain of their citizens.\n\n              To correct these errors and prevent further irreparable harm, this\n\n        Court should grant a stay pending appeal.1\n\n\n\n              1 In compliance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 8(a)(1),\n\n        the government asked the district court to stay its order pending\n                                                                        Continued on next page.\n                                              3\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 34      Filed: 04/04/2025   Pg: 6 of 194\n\n\n\n\n                                      STATEMENT\n\n              A.

On January 20, 2025, OPM transmitted a guidance memo to\n\n        Executive Branch agencies identifying probationary periods as \u201can\n\n        essential tool for agencies to assess employee performance.\u201d\n\n\n                                              6\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 34     Filed: 04/04/2025   Pg: 9 of 194\n\n\n\n\n        Memorandum from Charles Ezell, Acting Director, U.S. Office of\n\n        Personnel Management, to Heads and Acting Heads of Departments\n\n        and Agencies, Guidance on Probationary Periods, Administrative Leave\n\n        and Details, at 1 (Jan. 20, 2025). The memo directed agencies to\n\n        \u201cidentify all employees on probationary periods\u201d and \u201cpromptly\n\n        determine whether those employees should be retained at the agency.\u201d\n\n        Id. On March 4, OPM issued revised guidance emphasizing that\n\n        agencies \u201chave ultimate decision-making authority over, and\n\n        responsibility for, such personnel actions.\u201d Memorandum from Charles\n\n        Ezell, Acting Director, U.S. Office of Personnel Management, to Heads\n\n        and Acting Heads of Departments, Guidance on Probationary Periods,\n\n        Administrative Leave and Details, at 2 (rev.

Plaintiffs\u201419 states and the District of Columbia\u2014\n\n        commenced this action by suing 21 federal agencies on March 6, 2025,\n\n        and they sought a temporary restraining order the following day. See\n\n        Dkt. Nos. 1, 4. On March 13, the district court entered a nationwide\n\n        temporary restraining order requiring the government to \u201cREINSTATE\n\n        all Affected Probationary Employees \u2026 FORTHWITH, and in any event\n\n        before March 17, 2025, at 1:00 p.m. EDT.\u201d Dkt. No. 44, at 1.2 The court\n\n        further restrained the government from \u201cconduct[ing] any future\n\n        [RIFs]\u2014whether formally labeled as such or not\u2014except in compliance\n\n        with\u201d notice and other applicable requirements. Id. at 1-2.\n\n              The government endeavored to promptly comply with the court\u2019s\n\n        order in the limited time provided, see generally Dkt. Nos. 52, 103, while\n\n        also seeking emergency relief from this Court, see Emergency Mot. for\n\n        Stay Pending Appeal (Mar. 17, 2025). On March 21, this Court denied\n\n        the government\u2019s motion, noting the \u201cdistrict court\u2019s stated intention to\n\n        hold a hearing on March 26, 2025, and to promptly grant or deny\n\n\n\n\n              2 The temporary restraining order did not extend to defendants\n\n        Department of Defense, National Archives and Records Administration,\n        and OPM, as the states failed to present sufficient evidence concerning\n        terminations at those agencies. See Dkt.

But she criticized\n\n        the district court\u2019s grant of nationwide relief. See id. at 4-5.\n\n              After extending the temporary restraining order, see Dkt. No. 115,\n\n        the district court entered a preliminary injunction on April 1. See Op.;\n\n        see also Dkt. No. 126 (Order). Like the temporary restraining order, the\n\n        preliminary injunction stays the \u201cpurported terminations of Affected\n\n        Probationary Employees\u201d and provides that defendants shall not\n\n        \u201cconduct any future [RIFs]\u2014whether formally labeled as such or not\u2014\n\n        \u2026 except in compliance with\u201d statutory and regulatory requirements.\n\n        Order 1-2. And the injunction directs agency defendants to \u201cundo the\n\n        purported terminations\u201d by \u201cTuesday, April 8, 2025, at 2:00 p.m.,\u201d to the\n\n        extent agencies have not already done so pursuant to the temporary\n\n        restraining order. Order 1. The injunction extends to two agencies not\n\n        included in the temporary restraining order\u2014the Department of\n\n        Defense and OPM. See Order 3-4. But the injunction is geographically\n\n        narrower than the temporary restraining order, insofar as it applies\n\n\n                                              9\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 34      Filed: 04/04/2025   Pg: 12 of 194\n\n\n\n\n        only to employees \u201c[w]hose duty station (prior to any purported\n\n        termination) and/or residence is in\u201d a plaintiff jurisdiction.

The court found that the states\n\n        had sufficiently shown harms flowing from the informational injury,\n\n        including \u201cthe monetary costs and losses of services associated with\u201d\n\n        providing social services \u201cto the suddenly unemployed.\u201d Op. 18. The\n\n        court further accepted that a reduction of \u201cstate income tax revenues\u201d\n\n        that had already occurred was \u201creal enough\u201d for purposes of Article III.\n\n        Op. 19. The court found that these injuries were caused by defendants\u2019\n\n\n                                             10\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 34     Filed: 04/04/2025   Pg: 13 of 194\n\n\n\n\n        failure to provide notice, Op. 25-26, and that they were redressable\n\n        because reinstatements would rectify the \u201cdownstream harms\u201d that\n\n        flowed from the asserted informational injury, Op. 27.\n\n              The court rejected the government\u2019s contention that the states\u2019\n\n        claims concerning the termination of federal employment may only be\n\n        pursued under the CSRA and the FSLMRS, reasoning that the\n\n        statutory scheme \u201cis about where employees and unions must go to\n\n        press claims relevant to them\u201d but \u201cnot about where States may go to\n\n        press wholly distinct claims based on wholly distinct injuries.\u201d Op. 34.\n\n              On the merits, the court found that the termination of\n\n        probationary employees constituted a RIF because, in the court\u2019s view,\n\n        the \u201cterminations were not based upon any individualized review.\u201d Op.\n\n        44; see also Op. 45 (\u201cThe record reflects that the terminations were\n\n        effected by means of form letters terminating employees en masse,\n\n        despite good performance by those employees.\u201d).

See Op. 56-62.\n\n              The district court found that the remaining preliminary injunction\n\n        factors were satisfied.

The Government Is Likely To Prevail On The Merits\n\n              A.   The District Court Lacked Jurisdiction.\n\n                   1.    Article III Standing\n\n              States cannot sue the federal government on behalf of their\n\n        citizens as parens patriae, see Haaland v. Brackeen, 599 U.S. 255, 295\n\n        (2023), and the states therefore cannot challenge the federal\n\n        government\u2019s personnel actions based on alleged harms to terminated\n\n        probationary employees who are not before the court. Instead, to\n\n        establish Article III standing, a state\u2014like any other litigant\u2014must\n\n        demonstrate that it has itself suffered an injury-in-fact that is \u201cfairly\n\n        traceable to the challenged conduct of the defendant\u201d and \u201clikely to be\n\n        redressed by a favorable judicial decision.\u201d Spokeo, Inc. v. Robbins, 578\n\n        U.S. 330, 338 (2016). In granting a preliminary injunction, the district\n\n        court concluded that the states have standing based on downstream\n\n        harms to state budgets and operations from the termination of\n\n        probationary employees. E.g., Op. 19. But that remarkable theory is a\n\n        recipe for any state to micromanage the activities of the federal\n\n        government, and it is irreconcilable with Supreme Court precedent.\n\n              The states\u2019 standing theory rests on their assertion that, as result\n\n        of the federal government\u2019s personnel actions, they will have to take\n                                          13\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 34      Filed: 04/04/2025   Pg: 16 of 194\n\n\n\n\n        steps to provide resources to their citizens who were terminated and\n\n        will suffer alleged losses to their tax bases. See Dkt. No. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 169-207.\n\n        That argument is squarely foreclosed by United States v. Texas, 599\n\n        U.S. 670 (2023). In Texas, states challenged a federal immigration\n\n        policy that would \u201cimpose[] costs on the States.\u201d Id. at 674. The states\n\n        claimed the federal government\u2019s immigration-enforcement decisions\n\n        would force them to \u201csupply social services such as healthcare and\n\n        education\u201d to additional persons. Id. The Supreme Court held the\n\n        states lacked standing, explaining that \u201cfederal courts must remain\n\n        mindful of bedrock Article III constraints in cases brought by States\n\n        against an executive agency or officer.\u201d Id. at 680 n.3. \u201c[I]n our system\n\n        of dual federal and state sovereignty, federal policies frequently\n\n        generate indirect effects on state revenues or state spending.\u201d Id. And\n\n        a theory of standing based on those indirect effects is \u201cmore attenuated\u201d\n\n        and less likely to succeed. Id.; accord, e.g., Arizona v. Biden, 40 F.4th\n\n        375, 386 (6th Cir. 2022) (rejecting contention that any federal policy\n\n        that \u201cimposes peripheral costs on a State creates a cognizable Article III\n\n        injury\u201d).\n\n\n\n\n                                             14\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 34      Filed: 04/04/2025   Pg: 17 of 194\n\n\n\n\n              Similarly, here, the states assert that the federal government\u2019s\n\n        employment decisions have inflicted downstream harms. They allege,\n\n        for example, that the terminations have imposed burdens on state\n\n        \u201cadministrative process[es] for handling [unemployment insurance]\n\n        claims,\u201d Dkt. No. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 171, 179; threatened increased enrollment in\n\n        social services such as Medicaid, e.g., id. \u00b6\u00b6 205-206; and caused the\n\n        states to expend funds to establish informational resources for their\n\n        citizens, e.g., id. \u00b6\u00b6 168, 202, 205. Such harms are not cognizable\n\n        injuries-in-fact. See Texas, 599 U.S. at 674, 680 n.3. Were the rule\n\n        otherwise, states could claim standing to second-guess nearly any\n\n        federal personnel decision\u2014hirings, firings, relocations, etc.\u2014on the\n\n        theory that the decision has a downstream effect on state resources.\n\n              The district court\u2019s attempt to repackage the states\u2019 alleged\n\n        injuries as \u201cinformational,\u201d Op. 9, does not alter the analysis. The\n\n        district court understood the states\u2019 asserted harms to \u201cboil[] down\u201d to\n\n        just one injury: an \u201cinformational harm\u201d from the government\u2019s alleged\n\n        failure to provide states notice of its terminations. Id. But as the\n\n        district court recognized, Op. 17, informational injury cannot by itself\n\n        create Article III standing. See TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 594 U.S.\n\n\n                                             15\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 34      Filed: 04/04/2025   Pg: 18 of 194\n\n\n\n\n        413, 426 (2021). Instead, the asserted informational injury must cause\n\n        \u201creal\u201d harms that \u201care of the type that have traditionally been regarded\n\n        as providing a basis for a lawsuit in English or American courts.\u201d\n\n        Dreher v. Experian Info. Sols., Inc., 856 F.3d 337, 345 (4th Cir. 2017)\n\n        (quotation marks omitted). Here, the only harms the district court\n\n        identified are the purported harms to state resources discussed above,\n\n        which cannot suffice. See, e.g., Op. 10-11 (emphasizing burdens on state\n\n        \u201csocial-service programs,\u201d loss of \u201cincome-tax revenue,\u201d and an increase\n\n        in \u201cunemployment benefits applications\u201d).\n\n              Nor, in any case, would any such \u201cinformational\u201d injury support\n\n        the extraordinary relief ordered by the district court. A plaintiff\n\n        seeking injunctive relief on a theory of informational injury asserts that\n\n        a judicial order would lead him to obtain information he lacks\u2014\u201c[a]s\n\n        when an agency denies requests for information under the Freedom of\n\n        Information Act.\u201d Public Citizen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 491 U.S. 440,\n\n        449 (1989); see also, e.g., Laufer v. Naranda Hotels, LLC, 60 F.4th 156,\n\n        171 (4th Cir. 2023) (disabled plaintiff sought injunction requiring hotel\n\n        to provide information about accessible rooms). Here, at least as to\n\n        terminations that have already occurred, the states do not allege that\n\n\n                                             16\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 34      Filed: 04/04/2025   Pg: 19 of 194\n\n\n\n\n        any information is now being withheld from them. Any informational\n\n        injury no longer exists and could not possibly be grounds for the district\n\n        court\u2019s sweeping reinstatement order.\n\n              The district court nevertheless suggested that its reinstatement\n\n        remedy was \u201csufficient and necessary to redress the overarching\n\n        informational injury\u201d because the \u201cdownstream harms stem from the\n\n        increased pressure on state programs,\u201d and \u201can adequate remedy is one\n\n        that relieves that pressure.\u201d Op. 27. Yet the district court cited no\n\n        authority suggesting that an informational injury remains redressable\n\n        even after the plaintiff has obtained all the information it claimed was\n\n        missing, so long as the plaintiff experiences some follow-on\n\n        consequential injury. Cf., e.g., Bayala v. DHS, 827 F.3d 31, 34 (D.C.\n\n        Cir. 2016) (Freedom of Information Act case rendered moot by release of\n\n        documents). Nor may courts grant relief for an \u201cinformational injury\u201d\n\n        that goes far beyond redressing the lack of information itself. Thus,\n\n        even if the district court were correct that it had the equitable power to\n\n        order reinstatement of wrongfully terminated employees\u2014and it isn\u2019t,\n\n        see, e.g., Sampson v. Murray, 415 U.S. 61, 83 (1974)\u2014such relief was\n\n        plainly improper here.\n\n\n                                             17\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248    Doc: 34     Filed: 04/04/2025   Pg: 20 of 194\n\n\n\n\n                    2.    CSRA Channeling\n\n              Even if the states had Article III standing, the government would\n\n        remain likely to succeed because the district court lacks jurisdiction to\n\n        adjudicate their challenges to the employment decisions of federal\n\n        agencies. Instead, Congress has \u201cestablished a comprehensive system\u201d\n\n        that provides the \u201cexclusive means\u201d for reviewing such matters. Elgin\n\n        v. Department of the Treasury, 567 U.S. 1, 5, 8 (2012) (quotation marks\n\n        omitted).\n\n              The CSRA, together with the FSLMRS, \u201ccreates an integrated\n\n        scheme of administrative and judicial review, wherein the Congress\n\n        intentionally provided\u2014and intentionally chose not to provide\u2014\n\n        particular forums and procedures for particular kinds of claims.\u201d\n\n        American Fed\u2019n of Gov\u2019t Emps. v. Secretary of the Air Force, 716 F.3d\n\n        633, 636 (D.C. Cir. 2023) (alterations, citation, and quotations marks\n\n        omitted). Congress allowed certain individual federal employees who\n\n        are affected by agency personnel decisions to challenge those decisions\n\n        \u201cby litigating their claims through the statutory scheme in the context\n\n        of [a] concrete\u201d dispute, albeit limited to the claims and remedies\n\n\n\n\n                                             18\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 34      Filed: 04/04/2025    Pg: 21 of 194\n\n\n\n\n        provided by Congress. See American Fed\u2019n of Gov\u2019t Emps. v. Trump,\n\n        929 F.3d 748, 757 (D.C. Cir. 2019).\n\n              The district court never disputed that if this lawsuit were brought\n\n        by the real parties in interest\u2014terminated probationary employees\u2014it\n\n        could only proceed through the scheme enacted by Congress. See, e.g.,\n\n        Op. 34 (noting court\u2019s agreement that \u201cthe CSRA offers a limited review\n\n        scheme\u201d for \u201csuit[s] brought by employees or unions\u201d); see also, e.g.,\n\n        Fornaro v. James, 416 F.3d 63, 67 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (Roberts, J.) (\u201c[W]hat\n\n        you get under the CSRA is what you get.\u201d). Yet it concluded that those\n\n        statutory limitations are irrelevant because states are not entitled to\n\n        administrative or judicial review under the CSRA. Op. 34. That has it\n\n        backwards. The \u201cexclusion\u201d of states \u201cfrom the provisions establishing\n\n        administrative and judicial review for personnel action\u201d of the type\n\n        challenged here \u201cprevents [them] from seeking review\u201d under other\n\n        provisions. United States v. Fausto, 484 U.S. 439, 455 (1988) (emphasis\n\n        added); see also Grosdidier v. Chairman, Broad. Bd. of Governors, 560\n\n        F.3d 495, 497 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (\u201c[T]he CSRA is the exclusive avenue for\n\n        suit even if the plaintiff cannot prevail \u2026.\u201d).\n\n\n\n\n                                              19\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 34      Filed: 04/04/2025   Pg: 22 of 194\n\n\n\n\n              Supreme Court precedent makes clear that when a comprehensive\n\n        scheme of the sort at issue here permits review at the behest of some\n\n        types of plaintiffs but not others, it implicitly precludes review by\n\n        plaintiffs who are not authorized to bring claims. In Block v.\n\n        Community Nutrition Institute, 467 U.S. 340, 347 (1984), the Supreme\n\n        Court considered a statute that permitted dairy handlers to obtain\n\n        review of certain \u201cmarket orders\u201d after exhausting administrative\n\n        remedies, but did not authorize review by anyone else. See id. at 346\n\n        (citing 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 608c). When a group of dairy consumers sought\n\n        review of a marketing order, the Supreme Court explained that the\n\n        statute omits a \u201cprovision for participation by consumers in any\n\n        proceeding,\u201d and that \u201c[i]n a complex scheme of this type, the omission\n\n        of such a provision is sufficient reason to believe that Congress intended\n\n        to foreclose consumer participation in the regulatory process.\u201d Id. at\n\n        347. Accordingly, the Court explained, the \u201cstructure of this Act\n\n        indicates that Congress intended only producers and handlers, and not\n\n        consumers, to ensure that the statutory objectives would be realized.\u201d\n\n        Id. And the \u201crestriction of the administrative remedy to handlers\n\n        strongly suggests that Congress intended a similar restriction of\n\n\n                                             20\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 34      Filed: 04/04/2025    Pg: 23 of 194\n\n\n\n\n        judicial review of market orders.\u201d Id. Any other holding would\n\n        facilitate circumvention of the comprehensive statutory scheme. See id.\n\n        at 348.\n\n              The principles described in Block fully apply to the CSRA. See\n\n        Fausto, 484 U.S. at 448 (applying Block to conclude that certain\n\n        employees who lack CSRA appeal rights \u201cshould not be able to demand\n\n        judicial review for the type of personnel action covered by that\n\n        chapter\u201d); see also Thunder Basin Coal Co. v. Reich, 510 U.S. 200, 207\n\n        (1994) (citing Block for governing standards in determining if review is\n\n        precluded). Just as Congress \u201cintentionally foreclosed judicial review to\n\n        employees who \u2026 are subjected to disciplinary actions which are\n\n        modest in nature,\u201d Pinar v. Dole, 747 F.2d 899, 912 (4th Cir. 1984), it\n\n        intentionally foreclosed judicial review by parties other than those\n\n        whom it specifically authorized to seek relief.\n\n              It is no answer to suggest, as the district court did, that the states\n\n        are bringing claims that are \u201cfundamentally different\u201d from those that\n\n        employees may bring under the CSRA. Op. 36. The states\u2019 claims, at\n\n        bottom, rest on allegations that the government unlawfully terminated\n\n        probationary employees, e.g., Dkt. No. 1, \u00b6 1, and the states sought\u2014\n\n\n                                             21\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 34      Filed: 04/04/2025   Pg: 24 of 194\n\n\n\n\n        and the district court granted\u2014reinstatement of affected employees.\n\n        As discussed above, the CSRA is the exclusive review scheme for such a\n\n        challenge to federal personnel decisions, and it permits employees to\n\n        contend that they were unlawfully terminated and to seek\n\n        reinstatement on that basis. See supra pp. 5-6. Some terminated\n\n        probationary employees are invoking the CSRA to seek exactly that\n\n        relief on the same theory that the states advance here. See, e.g., U.S.\n\n        Office of Special Counsel\u2019s Initial Request for Stay of Personnel Actions\n\n        at 10-15, U.S. Office of Special Counsel, ex rel. Doe v. Department of\n\n        Agric., No. CB-1208-25-0020-U-1 (M.S.P.B. Feb. 28, 2025) (alleging that\n\n        terminations of probationary employees unlawfully failed to follow RIF\n\n        procedures).\n\n              The district court was therefore plainly wrong in suggesting that\n\n        there is no \u201cidentity of interests between the States and the fired\n\n        employees.\u201d Op. 37. Yet to the extent the district court were correct\n\n        that there was no identity of interests, that would only make all the\n\n        more apparent the impropriety of permitting the states to seek relief on\n\n        terminated employees\u2019 behalf, where no affected employees are a party\n\n        to this suit. Cf., e.g., Broussard v. Meineke Disc. Muffler Shops, Inc.,\n\n\n                                             22\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 34     Filed: 04/04/2025   Pg: 25 of 194\n\n\n\n\n        155 F.3d 331, 338 (4th Cir. 1998) (in class action context, \u201cbasic due\n\n        process requires that named plaintiffs possess undivided loyalties to\n\n        absent class members\u201d).\n\n              At bottom, Congress did not leave a gaping hole in the CSRA by\n\n        permitting states to challenge federal employees\u2019 terminations on their\n\n        behalf. Indeed, if Congress had wanted to authorize review by other\n\n        parties who suffer downstream economic loss when a federal employee\n\n        is terminated\u2014his state of residence, his spouse, his creditors, etc.\u2014it\n\n        could easily have done so. Instead, Congress limited review of federal\n\n        employment actions to actions by affected employees themselves.\n\n        Failing to heed that congressional judgment would encourage litigants\n\n        to \u201cbypass the statutory and administrative remedies in order to seek\n\n        direct judicial relief and thereby deprive the Government of the\n\n        opportunity to work out its personnel problems within the framework it\n\n        has so painstakingly established.\u201d Pinar, 747 F.2d at 913 (quotation\n\n        marks omitted).\n\n              B.   The Government Did Not Conduct A Reduction\n                   In Force Requiring Notice To States.\n\n              On the merits, the essential premise of the district court\u2019s order\u2014\n\n        that agencies\u2019 terminations of probationary employees amounted to an\n\n                                            23\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 34      Filed: 04/04/2025   Pg: 26 of 194\n\n\n\n\n        unannounced RIF\u2014is wrong. The district court emphasized that\n\n        \u201c[n]early every termination letter in the record reflects that the\n\n        terminations purport to be for-cause.\u201d Op. 41. But the court doubted\n\n        that sufficient cause existed to terminate probationary employees. Op.\n\n        44. Even if the district court were correct, however, that sufficient\n\n        cause did not exist for any particular employee, that would be a claim\n\n        that affected employees may pursue\u2014and in many cases are pursuing\u2014\n\n        through the procedures created by the CSRA. It would not mean the\n\n        government has conducted unannounced unlawful RIFs.\n\n              In stark contrast to the termination of any particular employee, a\n\n        RIF focuses on the \u201cpositions\u201d that are to be filled, abolished, or\n\n        vacated\u2014not the specific employees. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.201(a)(1). When an\n\n        agency \u201cformally announce[s] a reduction in force,\u201d it may take action to\n\n        release employees \u201cbecause of lack of work; shortage of funds;\n\n        insufficient personnel ceiling; reorganization; the exercise of\n\n        reemployment rights or restoration rights; or reclassification of an\n\n        employee\u2019s position d[u]e to erosion of duties,\u201d subject to requirements\n\n        in which employees compete for continued employment based on their\n\n\n\n\n                                             24\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 34       Filed: 04/04/2025   Pg: 27 of 194\n\n\n\n\n        seniority level, veterans status, and performance history. See generally\n\n        id. \u00a7\u00a7 351.201(a), 351.501.\n\n              The district court reasoned that, because a large number of\n\n        probationary employees were terminated, the terminations must have\n\n        been \u201cessentially reorganizations\u201d that amounted to a RIF. Op. 43. But\n\n        under the regulations, a reorganization is \u201cthe planned elimination,\n\n        addition, or redistribution of functions or duties in an organization,\u201d 5\n\n        C.F.R. \u00a7 351.203 (emphasis added). The court identified no record\n\n        evidence that any agency had eliminated functions or duties, nor did it\n\n        find that any \u201cpositions\u201d (as distinct from employees) had been\n\n        eliminated. Instead, the district court simply stated that because the\n\n        government\u2019s efforts were \u201caimed at a reduction in probationers across\n\n        the board,\u201d Op. 46, it must have actually conducted a RIF. The\n\n        government is highly likely to succeed in demonstrating that this\n\n        conclusion was erroneous.\n\n        II.   The Equitable Factors Favor A Stay.\n\n              The equitable factors strongly favor a stay. Every day that the\n\n        injunction is in effect causes irreparable injuries to the government and\n\n        the public, whose interests \u201cmerge\u201d here. Nken, 556 U.S. at 435; see\n\n\n                                              25\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 34       Filed: 04/04/2025   Pg: 28 of 194\n\n\n\n\n        also Dkt. No. 134, at 4 (recognizing \u201cconsiderable public interests that\n\n        favor the Government\u2019s position\u201d). Across the government, agencies\n\n        have determined that the continued employment of certain employees is\n\n        unnecessary and inconsistent with those agencies\u2019 missions. It\n\n        obviously disserves the government to require it to continue employing\n\n        individuals whose services it no longer requires, for the government has\n\n        \u201ctraditionally been granted the widest latitude in the \u2018dispatch of its\n\n        own internal affairs.\u2019\u201d Sampson, 415 U.S. at 83. And on a practical\n\n        level, the government will never be able to recover the salaries that it is\n\n        being ordered to continue paying if it eventually wins this case. See Op.\n\n        81 (acknowledging as much). That harm could theoretically have been\n\n        addressed by a bond under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(c), but\n\n        the district court further abused its discretion by setting the amount of\n\n        the bond at a nominal $100 per plaintiff state, Op. 80-82\u2014which is\n\n        plainly inadequate to protect the government from the losses that it is\n\n        incurring while the district court\u2019s order is in effect. Finally, the\n\n        district court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction, despite the existence of\n\n        comprehensive remedial scheme, has a \u201cdisruptive effect on the\n\n\n\n\n                                              26\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 34      Filed: 04/04/2025   Pg: 29 of 194\n\n\n\n\n        administrative processes established by the government to handle cases\n\n        such as these.\u201d Garcia v. United States, 680 F.2d 29, 32 (5th Cir. 1982).\n\n              On the other side of the ledger, the states have not established\n\n        irreparable injury warranting extraordinary relief. In the ordinary\n\n        course, federal employment disputes brought by proper plaintiffs\u2014\n\n        employees\u2014rarely justify preliminary relief because there are\n\n        procedures by which a terminated employee may obtain back pay from\n\n        the federal government. See, e.g., Sampson, 415 U.S. at 92 & n.68. And\n\n        as discussed above, the states\u2019 allegations of downstream economic\n\n        effects do not establish an injury-in-fact, let alone irreparable harm.\n\n        See supra pp. 13-17. And even assuming that plaintiffs established\n\n        irreparable injury, any such injury is \u201cplainly outweigh[ed]\u201d by the\n\n        public interest and the Executive Branch\u2019s interest in the effective and\n\n        efficient management of the federal workforce.

President Trump and his Administration have made no secret of their contempt for the\n\n        roughly 2 million committed professionals who form the federal civil service. Nor have they\n\n        disguised their plans to terminate vast numbers of civil servants, starting with tens of thousands of\n\n        probationary employees. These large-scale, indiscriminate firings are not only subjecting the\n\n        Plaintiff States and communities across the country to chaos. They are also against the law.\n\n        2.     Federal statutes and regulations set forth procedures that federal agencies must follow\n\n        when conducting reductions in force (\u201cRIFs\u201d). Critically, these procedures require that federal\n\n        agencies provide 60 days of advance notice to affected employees and to states, so that they have\n\n        an opportunity to mitigate the harms of layoffs. Where an agency fails to provide such notice, the\n\n        employees \u201cmay not be released.\u201d\n\n        3.     Over the past month, the new Administration has run roughshod over the RIF requirements.\n\n        Specifically, as part of an effort to reduce the size of the federal workforce, the Office of Personnel\n\n        Management (\u201cOPM\u201d) has unlawfully directed federal agencies to conduct mass terminations of\n\n        probationary employees, suddenly and without any advance notice. Defendants have followed\n\n        through on this directive, firing employees by the hundreds and, in many instances, thousands\u2014\n\n        all without following the procedures for conducting RIFs and without providing notice to the\n\n        affected employees or states.\n\n        4.     This campaign has inflicted immense harms on tens of thousands of probationary\n\n        employees and their families. It has rendered them jobless without providing any advance notice\n\n\n\n                                                          8\n                                                     ADD.97\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248    Doc: 34    Filed: 04/04/2025 Pg: 132 of 194\n              Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA Document 1 Filed 03/06/25 Page 9 of 55\n\n\n\n        that might have given them an opportunity to seek other employment or even budget to prepare\n\n        for the loss of income. As a result, many affected employees and their families are struggling to\n\n        make ends meet\u2014to pay rent, buy groceries, and care for their loved ones.\n\n        5.     This campaign is harming Plaintiff States, too. In addition to the informational and\n\n        procedural injuries resulting from the deprivation of notice to which they were entitled, the lack of\n\n        notice has impeded the ability of many Plaintiff States to support affected employees and thereby\n\n        mitigate the financial and other impacts on state services. In fact, pursuant to federal statutory\n\n        requirements, Plaintiff States operate rapid response teams that provide immediate services and\n\n        resources to workers subject to mass layoffs. These services include job placement and job training\n\n        services as well as connections to social services like unemployment insurance and health\n\n        insurance. Because of Defendants\u2019 failure to adhere to the RIF notice procedures, many Plaintiff\n\n        States have had to scramble and expend additional resources to identify even which agencies have\n\n        conducted layoffs and which affected employees require support.\n\n        6.     Because of the lack of notice, many Plaintiff States have also faced increased\n\n        administrative demands related to adjudicating unemployment claims; decreased tax revenues; and\n\n        increased demands for social services. Some Plaintiff States have also lost the benefit of services\n\n        provided by federal employees embedded within state agencies, without any time to prepare.\n\n        7.     To address these harms to Plaintiff States, this action seeks declaratory and injunctive relief\n\n        requiring Defendants: to cease the RIFs of probationary employees that they have conducted\n\n        unlawfully and without notice; to reinstate any probationary employees who were terminated as\n\n        part of mass terminations on or after January 20, 2025; to refrain from separating any employees\n\n        pursuant to a RIF prior to reinstatement of the unlawfully terminated probationary employees; and\n\n\n\n\n                                                         9\n                                                     ADD.98\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 34     Filed: 04/04/2025 Pg: 133 of 194\n             Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA Document 1 Filed 03/06/25 Page 10 of 55\n\n\n\n        to conduct any future RIFs in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, including providing\n\n        required notices to Plaintiff States.\n\n                                      I.

The probationary period provides the opportunity for the federal agency to assess the\n\n        individual performance of the employee. Under governing OPM regulations, an agency \u201cshall\n\n        utilize the probationary period as fully as possible to determine the fitness of the employee and\n\n\n\n\n                                                         19\n                                                    ADD.108\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 34     Filed: 04/04/2025 Pg: 143 of 194\n             Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA Document 1 Filed 03/06/25 Page 20 of 55\n\n\n\n        shall terminate his or her services during this period if the employee fails to demonstrate fully his\n\n        or her qualifications for continued employment.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.803(a).\n\n        79.    Most employees in the excepted service are also subject to a statutory trial period of two\n\n        years, which, like the probationary period in the competitive service, is intended to permit the\n\n        agency to evaluate the employee\u2019s performance and fitness for long-term employment. 5 U.S.C.\n\n        \u00a7 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii).\n\n        80.    Outside of the context of a RIF, federal agencies may lawfully terminate probationary\n\n        employees for one of two reasons.\n\n        81.    First, a federal agency may lawfully terminate a probationary employee for reasons based\n\n        on conditions arising before the employee\u2019s probationary appointment. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.805.\n\n        82.    Second, a federal agency may lawfully terminate a probationary employee based on the\n\n        agency\u2019s assessment of the employee\u2019s performance during the probationary period, pursuant to 5\n\n        C.F.R. \u00a7 315.804(a), which is entitled: \u201cTermination of probationers for unsatisfactory\n\n        performance or conduct.\u201d\n\n        83.    Under that regulation, \u201cwhen an agency decides to terminate an employee serving a\n\n        probationary or trial period because his work performance or conduct during this period fails to\n\n        demonstrate his fitness or his qualifications for continued employment, it shall terminate his\n\n        services by notifying him in writing as to why he is being separated and the effective date of the\n\n        action.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.804(a). \u201cThe information in the notice as to why the employee is being\n\n        terminated shall, as a minimum, consist of the agency\u2019s conclusions as to the inadequacies of his\n\n        performance or conduct.\u201d Id. Trial-period employees in the excepted service have the same notice\n\n        rights when removed from their positions for performance reasons. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 316.304.\n\n\n\n\n                                                         20\n                                                    ADD.109\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 34     Filed: 04/04/2025 Pg: 144 of 194\n             Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA Document 1 Filed 03/06/25 Page 21 of 55\n\n\n\n        B.     RIF Requirements\n\n        84.    Apart from terminations of probationary employees for conditions arising before their\n\n        appointments or for unsatisfactory performance or conduct, federal agencies may only terminate\n\n        probationary employees as part of an agency RIF.\n\n        85.    A reduction-in-force \u201cis an administrative procedure by which agencies eliminate jobs and\n\n        reassign or separate employees who occupied the abolished positions. A RIF is not an adverse\n\n        action against a particular employee, but is directed solely at a position within an agency.\u201d James\n\n        v. Von Zemenszky, 284 F.3d 1310, 1314 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (citation omitted); Schall v. U.S. Postal\n\n        Serv., 73 F.3d 341, 344 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (similar).\n\n        86.    An agency must follow specific statutory directives in conducting a RIF, including\n\n        following the retention preferences in the statute, giving preference to the retention of military\n\n        veterans, and considering the employee\u2019s tenure and length of service. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(a)(1), (3).\n\n        87.    Congress delegated to OPM the authority to promulgate regulations that agencies must\n\n        follow in implementing RIFs. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(a).\n\n        88.    Pursuant to that statutory authorization, and through notice-and-comment rulemaking,\n\n        OPM has issued detailed regulations setting forth the procedures by which agencies must conduct\n\n        RIFs. See 5 C.F.R. Part 351.\n\n        89.    All agencies of the federal government are required to comply with the RIF regulations\n\n        whenever they \u201cdetermine[] that a reduction [in] force is necessary.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.204.\n\n        90.    The RIF regulations apply to employees in the competitive and excepted services. 5 C.F.R.\n\n        \u00a7 351.202(a), (b).\n\n        91.    Probationary employees are expressly covered by the RIF regulations. 5 C.F.R.\n\n        \u00a7\u00a7 351.501(b)(2), 351.502(b)(2). Probationary employees are included in \u201cgroup II\u201d of three\n\n        groups of employees, and may only be released, in order of retention, after the release of\n\n\n                                                        21\n                                                   ADD.110\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 34     Filed: 04/04/2025 Pg: 145 of 194\n             Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA Document 1 Filed 03/06/25 Page 22 of 55\n\n\n\n        \u201cgroup III\u201d employees, a group that includes employees under various temporary, term, and other\n\n        provisional appointments. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.501(b).\n\n        92.    Under these required RIF procedures, before conducting a RIF a federal agency must:\n\n        establish \u201ccompetitive areas in which employees compete for retention\u201d; designate the\n\n        \u201ccompetitive areas\u201d of which employees are to compete for retention at least 90 days before the\n\n        effective date of the RIF; designate any \u201ccompetitive levels\u201d of positions included in the RIFs that\n\n        would permit the agency to reassign retained employees without causing undue interruption; and\n\n        rank employees for retention based on factors including their tenure group, time in service\n\n        (including military service), veteran preference, length of service, and performance. See 5 U.S.C.\n\n        \u00a7 3502(a); 5 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 351.402-351.404, 351.504.\n\n        C.     RIF Notice Requirements\n\n        93.    Under the federal RIF statute and associated regulations, federal agencies are required to\n\n        provide at least 60 days of prior written notice before they may release any federal civil service\n\n        employee under a RIF. The agency must provide the written notice to (a) the employee, (b) the\n\n        employee\u2019s collective bargaining representative, and (c) the state or District where an affected\n\n        employee\u2019s duty station was located if the RIF would involve at least 50 employees within the\n\n        competitive area, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d); 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.803(b).\n\n        94.    The notice to the state must be provided to the state or agency designated by the state to\n\n        perform rapid response activities under the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, now called the\n\n        Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act of 2014 (\u201cWIOA Agency\u201d), and must also be provided\n\n        to \u201c[t]he chief elected official of local government(s) within which these separations will occur.\u201d\n\n        5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.803(b); see 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d)(3)(A). The purpose of states\u2019 \u201crapid response\u201d\n\n        activities is to quickly make public and private resources available to workers who are laid off, to\n\n        minimize the disruption to the affected workers and their communities. To help the state or locality\n\n\n                                                        22\n                                                   ADD.111\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 34     Filed: 04/04/2025 Pg: 146 of 194\n             Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA Document 1 Filed 03/06/25 Page 23 of 55\n\n\n\n        prepare for the disruptions associated with job losses, notices must include: (a) the number of\n\n        employees to be separated from service due to the reduction in force, broken down by geographic\n\n        area and organizational unit, (b) when those separations will occur; and (c) other information that\n\n        may facilitate the delivery of services to the affected workers. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d); 5 C.F.R.\n\n        \u00a7 351.803(c).\n\n        95.    The notice to an affected employee must include: (a) information concerning the right to\n\n        reemployment consideration and career transition assistance; (b) a release to authorize the federal\n\n        government to share his or her resume and employment information with the WIOA Agency and\n\n        potential public or private sector employers; and (c) information about how to apply for\n\n        unemployment insurance and access other benefits. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.803(a).\n\n        96.    Where circumstances \u201cnot reasonably foreseeable\u201d preclude giving 60 days\u2019 written notice,\n\n        the agency may request that OPM shorten the notice period; however, \u201c[n]o notice period may be\n\n        shortened to less than 30 days.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(e).\n\n        97.    Where an agency fails to provide any of these statutorily required notices, an employee\n\n        \u201cmay not be released, due to a reduction in force.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d).\n\n                                     IV.     FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS\n\n        98.    Since President Trump took office on January 20, 2025, Defendant Agencies have, at\n\n        OPM\u2019s direction, terminated tens of thousands of probationary employees.\n\n        99.    The mass terminations of probationary employees since January 20 were not driven by\n\n        agency determinations related to the performance or qualifications of any particular probationary\n\n        employee. Rather, these layoffs have all been part of a coordinated effort directed by the White\n\n        House and OPM to reduce the size of the federal workforce.\n\n\n\n\n                                                        23\n                                                   ADD.112\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 34     Filed: 04/04/2025 Pg: 147 of 194\n             Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA Document 1 Filed 03/06/25 Page 24 of 55\n\n\n\n        100.    Because the mass terminations of probationary employees are part of an effort to\n\n        restructure and reduce the workforces at Defendant Agencies, they constitute RIFs. See 5 U.S.C.\n\n        \u00a7 3502; 5 C.F.R. Part 351.\n\n        101.    In terminating probationary employees en masse, Defendants have not abided by the\n\n        statutory and regulatory requirements for RIFs, including the requirement to provide 60 days\u2019\n\n        notice to the Plaintiff States. This has inflicted and will continue to inflict serious and irreparable\n\n        harms on the Plaintiff States, as they must now deal with a sudden surge in unemployment, without\n\n        the advance notice required under the federal RIF statute and regulations.\n\n        A.      Defendants Have Conducted Unlawful RIFs Throughout the Federal Government.\n\n        102.    On January 20, 2025, the day President Trump took office, President Trump appointed\n\n        Charles Ezell to serve as Acting OPM Director.\n\n        103.    The same day, Acting OPM Director Ezell distributed a memo to \u201cHeads and Acting Heads\n\n        of Departments and Agencies\u201d regarding \u201cGuidance on Probationary Periods, Administrative\n\n        Leave and Details.\u201d In the memo, OPM directed agency heads to \u201cidentify all employees on\n\n        probationary periods . . . and send a report to OPM listing all such employees\u201d no later than January\n\n        24, 2025. OPM further directed agencies to \u201cpromptly determine whether those employees should\n\n        be retained by the agency.\u201d1\n\n        104.    Also on January 20, 2025, President Trump signed an executive order entitled \u201cHiring\n\n        Freeze.\u201d2 In addition to ordering \u201ca freeze on the hiring of federal civilian employees\u201d throughout\n\n        the executive branch, he directed the Director of the Office of Management and Budget\u2014in\n\n        consultation with OPM and the United States Department of Government Efficiency Service\n\n\n\n        1\n          https://chcoc.gov/sites/default/files/Guidance%20on%20Probationary%20Periods%2C%20Administrative%20Leav\n        e%20and%20Details%XXX-XX-XXXX%20FINAL.pdf\n        2\n          https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/hiring-freeze/\n\n\n                                                           24\n                                                     ADD.113\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 34     Filed: 04/04/2025 Pg: 148 of 194\n             Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA Document 1 Filed 03/06/25 Page 25 of 55\n\n\n\n        (\u201cDOGE\u201d)\u2014to \u201csubmit a plan to reduce the size of the Federal Government\u2019s workforce through\n\n        efficiency improvements and attrition.\u201d\n\n        105.     On February 11, 2025, President Trump issued Executive Order 14210, entitled\n\n        \u201cImplementing the President\u2019s \u2018Department of Government Efficiency\u2019 Workforce Optimization\n\n        Initiative.\u201d The Executive Order directed agency heads to \u201cpromptly undertake preparations to\n\n        initiate large-scale reductions in force (RIFs), consistent with applicable law, and to separate from\n\n        Federal service temporary employees and reemployed annuitants working in areas that will likely\n\n        be subject to the RIFs.\u201d3\n\n        106.    Rather than wait for agency heads to develop RIF plans and follow applicable procedures,\n\n        however, Defendants began mass unlawful terminations of their probationary employees.\n\n        107.    On or around February 11, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau terminated\n\n        approximately 73 probationary employees. 4 The agency terminated 70-100 additional\n\n        probationary employees on February 13. 5\n\n        108.    On or around February 12, the Department of Education terminated 60 probationary\n\n        employees.6\n\n        109.    On or around February 12, the General Services Administration notified approximately\n\n        100 probationary employees that they would be terminated.7 Upon information and belief, these\n\n        terminations will become effective on March 7.\n\n\n\n\n        3\n          https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/implementing-the-presidents-department-of-\n        government-efficiency-workforce-optimization-initiative/\n        4\n          https://www.npr.org/2025/02/12/nx-s1-5294479/cfpb-workers-fired-trump-doge\n        5\n          https://www.npr.org/2025/02/14/nx-s1-5298144/federal-layoffs-usda-hud-defense-trump\n        6\n          https://www.npr.org/2025/02/13/nx-s1-5296928/layoffs-trump-doge-education-energy\n        7\n          https://www.reuters.com/world/us/mass-firings-federal-workers-begin-trump-musk-purge-us-government-2025-\n        02-13/\n\n\n                                                             25\n                                                       ADD.114\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 34     Filed: 04/04/2025 Pg: 149 of 194\n             Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA Document 1 Filed 03/06/25 Page 26 of 55\n\n\n\n        110.    On February 13, OPM officials met with agency officials throughout the federal\n\n        government and ordered agencies to lay off nearly all of the federal government\u2019s approximately\n\n        220,0000 probationary employees.8\n\n        111.    On February 14, OPM sent an email to all agency Chief Human Capital Officers (CHCOs)\n\n        and their deputies to \u201cclarif[y] immediate next steps for probationary employees.\u201d\n\n        112.    In its February 14 email, OPM explained its directive to agencies:\n\n                We have asked that you separate probationary employees that you have not\n                identified as mission critical no later than the end of the day Monday, 2/27. We\n                have attached a template letter. The separation date should be as soon as possible\n                that is consistent with applicable agency policies (including those in CBAs).\n\n        113.    OPM\u2019s February 14 email reiterated that OPM\u2019s directive should be followed in light of\n\n        the \u201cPresident\u2019s directive to dramatically reduce the size of the federal workforce.\u201d\n\n        114.

On or around February 20, the National Archives and Records Administration terminated\n\n        over 60 probationary employees.25\n\n        132.    Upon information and belief, on or around February 20, the Department of Labor notified\n\n        more than 50 probationary employees that they will be terminated. Upon information and belief,\n\n        the effective date of termination will be March 7.\n\n        133.    On February 21, the Department of Defense announced that it was planning to terminate\n\n        5,400 probationary workers starting the week of February 24. 26 Upon information and belief, those\n\n        terminations have not begun, but they may begin at any moment.\n\n        134.

On or around March 3, the Department of Commerce fired 73 probationary employees at\n\n        the National Institute for Standards and Technology.29\n\n        138.    Upon information and belief, Defendants have already terminated tens of thousands of\n\n        probationary employees.\n\n        139.    Defendants have not published official counts and locations of the employees they have\n\n        terminated, but based on publicly reported numbers and firsthand accounts from affected\n\n        employees, it appears that Defendants have terminated at least 24,000 probationary employees as\n\n        of the date of this Complaint. Because Plaintiff States have not received notice of these mass\n\n        terminations, this accounting is necessarily incomplete and may be far higher.\n\n        140.    Thousands of additional terminations are expected any day. To continue to reduce the size\n\n        of the federal workforce, agencies that have not yet terminated most of their probationary\n\n        employees may do so at any moment.\n\n        B.      Defendants Have Not Followed Required RIF Procedures for the Mass Layoffs of\n                Probationary Employees\n\n        141.    Although the mass terminations of probationary employees have constituted RIFs,\n\n        Defendants have failed to follow the RIF procedures required by statute and regulation.\n\n        142.    For example, Defendants did not designate the \u201ccompetitive areas\u201d in which employees\n\n        would compete for retention, which they must do at least 90 days before the effective date of any\n\n        RIF. See 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.402.\n\n        143.    Defendants did not designate any \u201ccompetitive levels\u201d of positions included in the RIFs\n\n        that would permit the agency to reassign retained employees without causing undue interruption.\n\n        See 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.403.\n\n\n\n        29\n          https://www.govexec.com/workforce/2025/03/some-agencies-are-still-firing-probationers-while-others-have-\n        recalled-theirs-following-court-ruling/403407/?oref=ge-skybox-post\n\n\n                                                              30\n                                                        ADD.119\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 34     Filed: 04/04/2025 Pg: 154 of 194\n             Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA Document 1 Filed 03/06/25 Page 31 of 55\n\n\n\n        144.   Defendants did not establish a retention register of employees in each competitive level of\n\n        positions included in the RIFs. See 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.404.\n\n        145.   Defendants did not then rank employees for retention based on their tenure group, time in\n\n        service (including military service), veteran preference, length of service, and performance. See 5\n\n        U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(a); 5 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 351.501-351.504.\n\n        146.   Defendants did not provide required notices 60 days in advance of the effective date of\n\n        termination to affected employees, their collective bargaining representatives, or to Plaintiff States.\n\n        See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d); 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.803.\n\n        147.   Especially relevant to Plaintiff States, Defendants did not provide affected employees with\n\n        the required releases to authorize the release of their resumes and other relevant employment\n\n        information to the relevant WIOA Agency, for employment referrals to potential public and private\n\n        sector employers. See 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.803(a).\n\n        148.   Likewise, Defendants did not provide Plaintiff States and the relevant WIOA Agencies\n\n        with any prior notice, much less the 60-day notice required by law, which would have alerted\n\n        Plaintiff States to the number of employees to be separated from the agencies, broken down by\n\n        geographic area, and provided the effective date of the planned separations as well as other\n\n        information that could have facilitated the delivery of rapid response services. See 5 U.S.C.\n\n        \u00a7 3502(d); 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.803(b)-(c).\n\n        149.   Rather than comply with their legal obligations, Defendants summarily terminated\n\n        probationary employees en masse, providing termination notices to the affected employees by\n\n        form letters and emails, which frequently included errors and in many instances failed to include\n\n        even the employee\u2019s name or job title.\n\n\n\n\n                                                          31\n                                                     ADD.120\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 34     Filed: 04/04/2025 Pg: 155 of 194\n             Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA Document 1 Filed 03/06/25 Page 32 of 55\n\n\n\n        150.   These form termination notices, issued near-simultaneously to thousands of federal\n\n        probationary employees, failed to include any particularized agency determinations related to the\n\n        performance or qualifications of each affected probationary employee to justify their termination.\n\n        The notices were pretextual because Defendants were actually engaged in RIFs designed to reduce\n\n        the size of the federal workforce.\n\n        151.   For example, agency management at the National Science Foundation informed\n\n        probationary employees that the NSF had previously chosen to retain its probationary employees\n\n        but that OPM had directed NSF to terminate the employees. The managers said that terminating\n\n        the probationary employees was not a decision the agency made,\u201d but was \u201ca direction [it had]\n\n        received\u201d from OPM and that NSF leadership had \u201cno choice\u201d but to \u201cfollow[] orders.\u201d\n\n        152.   Likewise, in response to OPM\u2019s directive to terminate probationary employees en masse,\n\n        the Department of Treasury directed the Internal Revenue Service to terminate all probationary\n\n        employees \u201cbased on performance.\u201d Without conducting any review of probationary employees\u2019\n\n        qualifications or performance, the Department of Treasury directed the IRS to terminate\n\n        approximately 6,700 probationary employees. These terminations were unrelated to the\n\n        probationary employees\u2019 qualifications, performance, or conduct, but were in fact a RIF aimed at\n\n        reducing the size of the agency\u2019s workforce.\n\n        153.   The same pattern occurred at the Center for Consumer Information and Insurance\n\n        Oversight (CCIIO), a subset of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) within the\n\n        Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). CCIIO had determined that none of its\n\n        probationary employees should be removed from service because all were well qualified for their\n\n        positions and were performing well. Nevertheless, on February 13, 2025, HHS directed CCIIO to\n\n        terminate all of its probationary employees and to issue form termination letters that stated falsely\n\n\n\n\n                                                         32\n                                                    ADD.121\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 34     Filed: 04/04/2025 Pg: 156 of 194\n             Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA Document 1 Filed 03/06/25 Page 33 of 55\n\n\n\n        that the affected employees were being terminated \u201cbecause [their] ability, knowledge, and skills\n\n        do not fit the Agency\u2019s current needs, and [their] performance has not been adequate to justify\n\n        further employment.\u201d The CCIIO terminated 82 probationary employees on February 15, 2025,\n\n        representing approximately 15% of its workforce of approximately 600.\n\n        154.    Defendants\u2019 failure to provide required RIF notices rendered any terminations ineffective\n\n        and unlawful because an employee \u201cmay not be released, due to a reduction in force\u201d unless an\n\n        agency provides all statutorily required notices. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d).\n\n        155.    As explained in further detail below in Section IV.C, Defendants\u2019 failure to provide these\n\n        required notices has harmed Plaintiff States in several ways, including by hindering the ability to\n\n        provide rapid response services.\n\n        C.      Plaintiffs Are Harmed As a Direct Result of Defendants\u2019 Failure to Follow RIF\n                Requirements and Provide Advance Notice to the States.\n\n        156.    Plaintiff States have suffered and will imminently suffer several types of irreparable injury\n\n        due to the federal government\u2019s failure to provide notice of the RIFs.\n\n        157.    As noted above, when a federal agency plans to release 50 or more employees in a RIF,\n\n        the agency must provide 60 days\u2019 notice to the affected States\u2019 WIOA Agencies as well as the\n\n        chief elected officials for affected local jurisdictions.\n\n        158.    Plaintiff States have not received notice of a federal reduction in force from any federal\n\n        agency.\n\n        159.    In enacting the RIF notice requirements, Congress recognized the harms inherent to\n\n        sudden, unexpected mass layoffs, including that economic dislocation of workers can easily create\n\n        a cascade of instability throughout a regional economy. And it sought to provide the states with\n\n        some protection against those harms by requiring that agencies provide them with advance notice.\n\n\n\n\n                                                           33\n                                                      ADD.122\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 34     Filed: 04/04/2025 Pg: 157 of 194\n             Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA Document 1 Filed 03/06/25 Page 34 of 55\n\n\n\n        160.    Defendants\u2019 failure to provide notice has inflicted other harms as well. As a result of the\n\n        lack of notice, Plaintiff States are unable to proactively reach affected individuals and provide\n\n        services that would mitigate the harm the employees and their communities suffer as a result of\n\n        the sudden job loss.\n\n        161.    Plaintiff States also suffer procedural injury resulting in additional expenditures and harms\n\n        to public finances that they would not have to bear if notice had been provided.\n\n                                          Rapid Response Expenditures\n\n        162.    The Federal Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act of 2014, 29 U.S.C.\n\n        \u00a7 3174(A)(2)(i), requires that each state have a rapid response program to conduct outreach to\n\n        workers affected by a mass layoff and to provide the workers with support services, including job\n\n        transition services.\n\n        163.    The notice required by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d)(3)(A) is intended to trigger rapid response\n\n        activities since it is explicitly to be given to the state entity required to carry out rapid response\n\n        activities.\n\n        164.    The purpose of the rapid response system is to reduce individuals\u2019 reliance on public\n\n        benefit systems, such as unemployment insurance; to promote economic recovery and vitality by\n\n        developing an ongoing, comprehensive approach to identify, plan for, and respond to layoffs and\n\n        dislocations; and to prevent or minimize the impact of mass layoffs on workers, businesses, and\n\n        communities.\n\n        165.    When notified of a forthcoming mass layoff, a state\u2019s rapid response team is required to:\n\n        contact the employer, representatives of the affected workers, and the local community; assess the\n\n        layoff plans and schedule; and provide information and support to affected employees, including\n\n\n\n\n                                                         34\n                                                    ADD.123\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 34     Filed: 04/04/2025 Pg: 158 of 194\n             Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA Document 1 Filed 03/06/25 Page 35 of 55\n\n\n\n        information about filing for unemployment compensation and career services. 20 CFR \u00a7\u00a7\n\n        682.300, 682.330.\n\n        166.   The rapid response teams also facilitate connections to partner agencies and organizations\n\n        that can provide terminated workers and their families with critical services, such as home heating\n\n        assistance, legal aid, and financial advice.\n\n        167.   Because Plaintiff States\u2019 rapid response teams have received no notice of federal RIFs,\n\n        certain teams have been required to dedicate significantly more staff, resources, and expenditures\n\n        to fulfill their statutory mission. In particular, they have had to devote significant time and\n\n        resources simply to try to identify workers subject to federal mass layoffs and to otherwise make\n\n        resources available to potentially affected individuals in new ways, all because federal agencies\n\n        have failed to provide the legally required notice of mass layoffs.\n\n        168.   As one example of these efforts, some state agencies handling unemployment claims have\n\n        created new websites, requiring significant time and expense. See Maryland Workers Impacted by\n\n        Recent Federal Actions, https://response.maryland.gov/federalpublicservants/. These efforts were\n\n        a further attempt to provide rapid response resources and services, which could normally be\n\n        targeted at specific personnel before they are laid off, but must now be provided less efficiently\n\n        and at greater expense to the entire public, because the states\u2019 personnel remain unaware of who\n\n        has been laid off and whether and when the next federal mass layoff event will occur.\n\n        169.   As another example, because Maryland\u2019s Department of Labor did not receive advance\n\n        notice, staff have conducted extensive affirmative outreach to dozens of federal agencies and\n\n        offices to try and determine the location and extent of upcoming layoffs. Despite these efforts,\n\n        staff have not received any substantive responses. The Department has also had to divert\n\n        significant additional time of other agency personnel from state projects to instead respond to\n\n\n\n\n                                                         35\n                                                       ADD.124\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 34     Filed: 04/04/2025 Pg: 159 of 194\n             Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA Document 1 Filed 03/06/25 Page 36 of 55\n\n\n\n        federal mass firings, to try and identify recently terminated employees and provide relevant\n\n        resources and services.\n\n                                     Unemployment Benefits Expenditures\n\n        170.   As a general matter, the federal government is required to reimburse states for\n\n        unemployment benefits provided to former federal employees. Specifically, Plaintiff States are\n\n        party to an agreement with the United States Secretary of Labor, wherein the Secretary shall pay,\n\n        as an agent of the United States, Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees (\u201cUCFE\u201d)\n\n        pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8502(a).\n\n        171.   Each Plaintiff State has its own procedures for handling Unemployment Insurance (\u201cUI\u201d)\n\n        claims. Regardless, sudden mass layoffs burden the administrative process for handling UI claims,\n\n        and the lack of notice and chaotic nature of Defendants\u2019 mass layoffs of probationary employees\n\n        has already exacerbated or likely will exacerbate the strain on the Plaintiff States\u2019 systems for\n\n        administering UI.\n\n        172.   Maryland\u2019s experience exemplifies the problems with the unlawful way the Defendants\n\n        have conducted RIFs of probationary employees.\n\n        173.   The Maryland Department of Labor manages claims for unemployment benefits by\n\n        individuals formerly employed to work in Maryland.\n\n        174.   Pursuant to Md. Code Ann., Lab. & Empl. \u00a7 8-805(a), an individual in Maryland who\n\n        wishes to collect unemployment insurance benefits must file a claim in accordance with\n\n        regulations adopted by the Maryland Secretary of Labor. Claimants file claims online using the\n\n        Department\u2019s system to assert a claim initially and to provide information to indicate the basis of\n\n        the claim, the name of the claimant\u2019s previous employer, the reason for her separation, work\n\n        experience, and other relevant information. COMAR 09.32.02.05.\n\n\n\n\n                                                        36\n                                                   ADD.125\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 34     Filed: 04/04/2025 Pg: 160 of 194\n             Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA Document 1 Filed 03/06/25 Page 37 of 55\n\n\n\n        175.   The reason for termination alleged by the claimant is then transmitted to the claimant\u2019s\n\n        employer(s) for verification. The employer is then asked to furnish a report of the separation from\n\n        employment containing, among other information, the reason for the employee\u2019s separation and a\n\n        report of wage history. Md. Code Ann. Lab. & Empl. \u00a7 8-627; see also COMAR 09.32.02.05.\n\n        176.   Maryland law disqualifies some claimants from benefits depending on the circumstances\n\n        of their separation from employment. See Md. Code Ann. Lab. & Empl. \u00a7 8-1001, et seq.\n\n        Disqualifying circumstances include, among other reasons, termination for misconduct,\n\n        aggravated misconduct, and gross misconduct. Id. In addition, a claimant is disqualified if they\n\n        quit their job without good cause directly related to employment conditions or employer actions.\n\n        Md. Code Ann. Lab. & Empl. \u00a7 8-1001(a).\n\n        177.   If a determination involves a resolution of a dispute of material fact, a claims examiner\n\n        from the Maryland Department of Labor must conduct a predetermination fact-finding interview\n\n        after notice is provided to the employee and her employer(s). Md. Code. Ann. Lab & Empl. \u00a7 8-\n\n        806(a)(2). Thereafter, a written initial determination must be made stating, among other things, the\n\n        weekly benefit amount, maximum benefits payable to the claimant in a benefit year, and the\n\n        reasons for the determination. Md. Code Ann. Lab. & Empl. \u00a7 8-806(c).\n\n        178.   If the claims examiner\u2019s review of a claim reveals no dispute of material fact, but the\n\n        information reviewed indicates that claimant may be ineligible or disqualified, the claims\n\n        examiners must still schedule a call for an appointment for a fact-finding interview and render a\n\n        written decision. COMAR 09.32.16(D)-(E). A claimant or an employer may file an administrative\n\n        appeal within 15 days. Md. Code Ann. Lab. & Empl. \u00a7 8-806(e)(1).\n\n        179.   The Maryland Department of Labor\u2019s latest data indicates that 813 former federal\n\n        employees have applied for unemployment benefits since January 21, 2025.\n\n\n\n\n                                                        37\n                                                   ADD.126\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 34     Filed: 04/04/2025 Pg: 161 of 194\n             Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA Document 1 Filed 03/06/25 Page 38 of 55\n\n\n\n        180.      As noted above, the number of UCFE claims received by the Maryland Department of\n\n        Labor has increased significantly in just the last few weeks, starting on or around February 14,\n\n        2025, with an approximate range of 30 to 60 new such claims every day.\n\n        181.      In fact, the amount of UCFE claims received by the Maryland Department of Labor in\n\n        February 2025 is significantly higher than past years. From January 21 to March 3, 2024,\n\n        Maryland received only 189 unemployment claims containing federal wages in the claimant\u2019s base\n\n        period.\n\n        182.      While not required to apply for unemployment benefits, multiple individuals have attached\n\n        in their application their letter of employment termination from the federal government. Such\n\n        letters indicate that these individuals were probationary employees purportedly terminated for\n\n        cause.\n\n        183.      When an employer provides the initial report of separation to the Maryland Department of\n\n        Labor, the employer must indicate the reason for the separation, including whether the employee\n\n        was fired for cause, such as misconduct.\n\n        184.      Accordingly, if an employer states in its report of separation that an individual was\n\n        terminated because performance has not been adequate to justify further employment at the\n\n        agency, the Maryland Department of Labor\u2019s procedures require that the claims examiner must\n\n        investigate the reason for discharge.\n\n        185.      The Maryland Department of Labor is also required to verify both wages and reason for\n\n        separation of employment from each federal agency by sending a request for wage and separation\n\n        information. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 609.6(e)(1), 609.21 through 609.25. While private employers report\n\n        wages each quarter for all employees into the Department\u2019s database, see COMAR 09.32.01.12,\n\n        federal agencies are not required to regularly report active employee wages to the States.\n\n\n\n\n                                                         38\n                                                    ADD.127\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 34     Filed: 04/04/2025 Pg: 162 of 194\n             Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA Document 1 Filed 03/06/25 Page 39 of 55\n\n\n\n        186.   The same Department staff who handle regular unemployment claims also process and\n\n        adjudicate UCFE claims. Redirecting staff from handling regular UI claims to process and\n\n        adjudicate UCFE claims threatens to strain the state\u2019s resources.\n\n        187.   This diversion of personnel will undoubtedly impede the timely processing of regular UI\n\n        claims, creating significant backlogs and delays. The consequences will be far-reaching, affecting\n\n        countless individuals who depend on swift resolutions to sustain their livelihoods. By diverting\n\n        resources, the state must compromise the efficiency and responsiveness of its claims processing\n\n        system, ultimately undermining public trust and exacerbating economic hardship.\n\n        188.   While the Maryland Department of Labor is only beginning to process these claims, its\n\n        staff has already begun contacting relevant federal agencies to request information on relevant\n\n        terminations, to determine if they were in fact done for cause\n\n        189.   Thus far, Maryland has received at least 193 reports of separation from federal agencies,\n\n        concerning their recently terminated employees.\n\n        190.   Several Defendant agencies reported that probationary employees were terminated due to\n\n        a \u201cpermanent lack of work due to a change in Presidential Administration.\u201d\n\n        191.   In addition, the Maryland Department of Labor received several reports from Defendant\n\n        agencies explicitly stating that the employees were \u201claid off due to a reduction in force.\u201d\n\n        192.   And, as relevant here, certain reports by Defendants asserted that the employee at issue\n\n        was terminated for cause, for instance due to \u201cunsatisfactory work performance\u201d and similar\n\n        generic performance-related bases.\n\n        193.   Similarly, other reports highlighted various potentially disqualifying circumstances. For\n\n        instance, agencies indicated that claimants might not be genuinely unemployed or had voluntarily\n\n        resigned from their positions.\n\n\n\n\n                                                        39\n                                                   ADD.128\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 34     Filed: 04/04/2025 Pg: 163 of 194\n             Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA Document 1 Filed 03/06/25 Page 40 of 55\n\n\n\n        194.   Due Defendants\u2019 assertions that certain federal employees were terminated for cause or\n\n        otherwise ineligible or disqualified from benefits, or where there is disputed or conflicting\n\n        information, Maryland will be required to follow our intensive and mandatory investigative\n\n        process.\n\n        195.   The procedures impose a significant strain on the Maryland Department of Labor\u2019s\n\n        financial and temporal resources. Each case demanding interviews and/or a fact-finding\n\n        proceeding necessitates extensive staff hours for scheduling, conducting interviews, reviewing\n\n        evidence, and drafting detailed decisions. The need to send notices, accommodate witness\n\n        testimony, and facilitate cross-examination further escalates the time commitment. Moreover, the\n\n        potential for subsequent appeals triggers a cascade of additional hearings and reviews, diverting\n\n        resources from other essential departmental functions.\n\n        196.   Moreover, where federal agencies fail to provide responses to requests for separation\n\n        information, the Maryland Department of Labor must gather necessary wage and separation\n\n        information. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 609.6 (e)(2). This requires claims staff to solicit evidence from the\n\n        claimants in the form of pay stubs, W-2s and affidavits and to pay benefits based on that\n\n        information. In fact, recent federal guidance regarding federal unemployment during recent\n\n        government shutdowns encourages states to have claimants file an affidavit, using available proof,\n\n        given \u201climited federal HR resources\u201d to respond to requests for separation information.\n\n        \u201cUnemployment Insurance Program Letter 03-22,\u201d U.S. Department of Labor, November 2022,\n\n        https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/ETA/advisories/UIPL/2021/UIPL_03-22.pdf.\n\n        197.   In addition, termination notices issued by federal agencies were not issued in compliance\n\n        with governing reduction in force procedures. It is apparent that there are affected individuals,\n\n        including veterans, who should have been accorded preference under required RIF procedures but\n\n\n\n\n                                                       40\n                                                  ADD.129\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 34     Filed: 04/04/2025 Pg: 164 of 194\n             Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA Document 1 Filed 03/06/25 Page 41 of 55\n\n\n\n        were not. To the extent that preferences and other such requirements would have precluded\n\n        termination, and federal employees successfully challenge their separations, this will cause the\n\n        Department to re-adjudicate claims, pursue overpayments, and conduct appeals.\n\n        198.   While the federal Government provides grants for the purpose of administrating state\n\n        unemployment benefit programs, these grants are frequently less than the total administrative costs\n\n        incurred by Maryland. And that is the case now; the federal grant monies allocated to Maryland\n\n        are not sufficient to cover Maryland\u2019s unemployment benefit program administration.\n\n        199.   In these circumstances, Maryland relies on its Special Administrative Expense Fund\n\n        (\u201cSAEF\u201d) when federal funding is insufficient. See Md. Code Ann., Labor & Employment \u00a7\u00a7 8-\n\n        419 to 842. This fund may be comprised of previously transferred federal funds (in limited\n\n        circumstances), as well as monies collected by the state through fines, interest, and other penalties,\n\n        and contributions by the state legislature. Id. \u00a7 8-421. Currently, SAEF is comprised entirely of\n\n        state funds. Accordingly, any increase in administrative costs of Maryland\u2019s unemployment\n\n        benefits program will be covered at least in part by state funds.\n\n        200.   Other Plaintiff States must also undergo intensive and mandatory investigation and appeal\n\n        processes for handling disputes between claimants and employers involving the claimant\u2019s\n\n        eligibility. Many Plaintiff States anticipate a significant increase in these disputes given the\n\n        Defendants\u2019 chaotic and conflicting messaging around the reasons for terminating probationary\n\n        employees. Handling these disputes will cause those Plaintiff States to divert staff to handle the\n\n        time-consuming dispute resolutions and hinder the timely processing of ordinary unemployment\n\n        claims that are not disputed.\n\n        201.   For example, the Illinois Department of Employment Security (\u201cIDES\u201d) has already\n\n        received almost the same number of applications for unemployment benefits from former federal\n\n\n\n\n                                                         41\n                                                    ADD.130\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 34     Filed: 04/04/2025 Pg: 165 of 194\n             Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA Document 1 Filed 03/06/25 Page 42 of 55\n\n\n\n        workers this year as it received in all of last year. A substantial number of these claims require\n\n        resource intensive fact-finding that will cause backlogs and delays in IDES\u2019s processing of other\n\n        claims, exacerbating economic hardship for countless Illinoisans.\n\n        202.   IDES is also being forced to divert resources and staff to respond to the latest layoff news,\n\n        to identify affected federal agencies and ex-employees, provide information, and adjust procedures\n\n        and resources to assist confused and unemployed workers in Illinois, all in a complicated and\n\n        rapidly evolving environment. To take one example, IDES had to create a new webpage, at\n\n        significant time and expense, in an attempt to provide resources and services. See\n\n        https://ides.illinois.gov/unemployment/deferred-resignation-of-federal-employees.html.        Such\n\n        efforts could normally be targeted at specific personnel subject to impending layoff events but\n\n        must instead be provided less efficiently and at greater expense to the entire public because IDES\n\n        personnel remain unaware of the individuals who have already been laid off and whether and when\n\n        the next federal mass layoff event will occur.\n\n        203.    In some jurisdictions, a flood of contested UI claims will cause a backlog that affects the\n\n        timely adjudication of a wide range of administrative matters that are handled by the same\n\n        administrative law judges (\u201cALJs\u201d), ranging from building code enforcement to traffic tickets.\n\n        204.   Plaintiff States have seen or anticipate seeing an uptick in UI claims in the areas in which\n\n        the probationary employee layoffs occurred. This sudden increase\u2014without any advanced\n\n        notice\u2014has burdened and will continue to burden state agencies charged with administering UI\n\n        benefits.\n\n\n\n\n                                                         42\n                                                   ADD.131\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 34     Filed: 04/04/2025 Pg: 166 of 194\n             Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA Document 1 Filed 03/06/25 Page 43 of 55\n\n\n\n                                      Expenditures for Other Social Services\n\n        205.   Plaintiff States bear other burdens associated with many residents suddenly losing income.\n\n        These costs arise in the administration of programs aimed at providing connections to social\n\n        services, like health care and food assistance.\n\n        206.   Newly unemployed individuals apply for Medicaid at high rates, and the Plaintiff States\n\n        bear a direct economic cost to provide healthcare services to them and their families.\n\n                         Harms to State Programs That Depend on Federal Employees\n\n        207.   Many federal probationary employees who were terminated by the CDC were detailed to\n\n        work at Plaintiff States\u2019 public health agencies. This includes several employees who were hired\n\n        by the CDC as part of its Public Health Associate Program for Recent Graduates (\u201cPHAP\u201d). PHAP\n\n        is a two-year program that places recent college graduates with tribal, local, and territorial public\n\n        health agencies, as well as non-governmental organizations, to work alongside other public health\n\n        professionals in a variety of settings.\n\n        208.   For example, three recently terminated PHAP employees (\u201cAssociates\u201d) were assigned to\n\n        New Jersey\u2019s Department of Health (\u201cNJDOH\u201d), which is responsible for preventing the spread\n\n        of infectious diseases and developing emergency preparedness plans in the state. CDC and\n\n        NJDOH entered into a two-year contract, pursuant to which CDC agreed to cover all costs for the\n\n        Associates, including salary and benefits. NJDOH has participated in the PHAP program for\n\n        several years and often hires PHAP Associates, who gain invaluable training and institutional\n\n        knowledge over the course of the program, for permanent employment at the conclusion of their\n\n        two-year term.\n\n        209.   The three Associates were detailed to different NJDOH divisions that perform core public\n\n        health functions: the Division of HIV, STD, and TB Services; the Epidemiology, Environmental\n\n\n\n\n                                                          43\n                                                    ADD.132\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 34     Filed: 04/04/2025 Pg: 167 of 194\n             Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA Document 1 Filed 03/06/25 Page 44 of 55\n\n\n\n        and Occupational Health\u2019s Communicable Disease Service; and the Global Tuberculosis Institute\n\n        at Rutgers University. Each Associate was a member of a small team dedicated to reducing the\n\n        spread of communicable diseases such as HIV, TB, and foodborne and waterborne illnesses. This\n\n        work involved laborious investigations, contact tracing, and collaborations with numerous local,\n\n        state, and federal partners to ensure anyone infected or at risk of infection has access to treatment.\n\n        210.   Between February 16 and 17, 2025, NJDOH learned that the three Associates had been\n\n        terminated from their positions on February 15, 2025\u2014before the expiration of their contractual\n\n        two-year terms. CDC never notified NJDOH of these terminations. Between March 4 and 5,\n\n        NJDOH learned that the Associates were being reinstated.\n\n        211.   Despite their reinstatement, the sudden loss of essential personnel, coupled with the lack\n\n        of notice, caused NJDOH significant harm and disruption. NJDOH had invested significant time\n\n        and resources into months-long training for the Associates, and the agency did not have the\n\n        budgetary flexibility or hiring authority to replace them, particularly given the lack of any notice.\n\n        The unexpected staffing shortages and imminent need to reallocate and train existing staff already\n\n        caused delays and administrative chaos, which impeded NJDOH\u2019s ability to fulfill its mission of\n\n        limiting the spread of infectious diseases in the state. The timing of the terminations was especially\n\n        problematic because NJDOH has been dealing with numerous communicable disease challenges,\n\n        including H5N1, measles, Covid-19, influenza, norovirus, and RSV. The loss in workforce\n\n        capacity during this time hampered NJDOH\u2019s ability to fully respond to these public health threats.\n\n        212.   The lack of notice compounded the challenges created by the terminations. NJDOH was\n\n        not able to plan for the terminations, resulting in administrative inefficiencies, duplicative work,\n\n        and delayed notifications to persons exposed to certain communicable diseases.\n\n\n\n\n                                                         44\n                                                    ADD.133\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 34     Filed: 04/04/2025 Pg: 168 of 194\n             Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA Document 1 Filed 03/06/25 Page 45 of 55\n\n\n\n                                             Harms to State Finances\n\n        213.   The mass layoffs that have taken place without the legally required notice to Plaintiff States\n\n        will also have substantial impacts on the Plaintiff States\u2019 finances.\n\n        214.   For instance, the U.S. Secretary of Labor has discretion to reimburse states for\n\n        administrative costs required to conduct the state unemployment compensation program. 42 U.S.C.\n\n        \u00a7 502(a). While many Plaintiff States have been and continue to expend additional resources\n\n        necessary to address the uptick in federal unemployment claims, it is not yet known whether those\n\n        additional costs will be fully reimbursed.\n\n        215.   Further, Plaintiff States rely in large part on income tax revenue for their budgets. Because\n\n        Defendant agencies will no longer be withholding and paying income taxes to Plaintiff States on\n\n        behalf of the terminated probationary employees, the layoffs will result in a decrease to Plaintiff\n\n        States\u2019 revenues. Given the number of employees forced to seek reemployment\u2014with no notice\n\n        and no opportunity for Plaintiff States to provide support services\u2014it is highly likely that many of\n\n        the Plaintiff States\u2019 residents will be unemployed for prolonged periods, depriving the Plaintiff\n\n        States of significant income tax receipts.\n\n        216.   For example, the District of Columbia estimates that the mass terminations of probationary\n\n        employees will cause millions of dollars in lost annual income tax revenue. The District estimates\n\n        that its lost income tax revenue for the first 60 days alone, the period in which it should have\n\n        received advance notice of any RIFs, will cost the District at least hundreds of thousands of dollars\n\n        in lost income tax revenue. Had the District received the notice required by law, these losses would\n\n        likely have been mitigated, including because employees would not have been terminated during\n\n        the 60-day notice period and some would have been able to obtain alternative employment prior\n\n        to their termination.\n\n\n\n\n                                                         45\n                                                     ADD.134\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 34     Filed: 04/04/2025 Pg: 169 of 194\n             Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA Document 1 Filed 03/06/25 Page 46 of 55\n\n\n\n        217.   Likewise, the Maryland Comptroller projects that the mass terminations of probationary\n\n        employees will cause significant decreases in Maryland\u2019s income tax revenues. Maryland\u2019s budget\n\n        relies in large part on personal income tax revenue, which represented 55% of Maryland\u2019s general\n\n        fund revenues for fiscal year 2024. Approximately 250,000 federal workers reside in Maryland.\n\n        Although unemployed individuals receiving unemployment benefits generally pay income tax on\n\n        their benefits, the benefits paid are less than the amount the individuals earned when they were\n\n        fully employed, and therefore the taxes paid are generally less than the taxes paid during their\n\n        employment.\n\n        218.   Beyond the direct loss of income tax revenue, the Maryland Comptroller anticipates that a\n\n        sudden and significant increase of newly unemployed workers will have serious negative effects\n\n        on Maryland\u2019s labor market, including extended periods of unemployment, downward pressure on\n\n        wages, and the migration of residents out of the state.\n\n        219.   The terminations also impact state sales tax revenues.\n\n        220.   For example, for the District of Columbia, this impact comes from two primary sources:\n\n        First, federal employees living outside of the District who commute to work in the District\n\n        purchase meals at restaurants, pay parking fees, and purchase other goods and services before,\n\n        during, and after work. Second, in addition to these workday purchases, federal employees who\n\n        are District residents also contribute to our economy as full-time residents, spending on groceries,\n\n        household items, restaurants, clothing, and various services.\n\n        221.   The District estimates that these mass terminations could cause anywhere from hundreds\n\n        of thousands to millions of dollars in lost annual sales tax revenue. The District further estimates\n\n        that for the first 60 days alone, the period in which it should have received advance notice of any\n\n        RIFs, the District will lose tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars in sales tax revenues.

Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate herein by reference every allegation and paragraph set\n\n        forth previously.\n\n        223.   Under the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d), a court shall \u201chold unlawful and set\n\n        aside agency action . . . found to be . . . arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise\n\n        not in accordance with law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A).\n\n        224.   Defendants are agencies subject to the APA. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701.\n\n        225.   Because Defendants\u2019 mass terminations of probationary employees are part of an effort to\n\n        restructure and reduce the federal workforce, they constitute RIFs, and Defendants were obligated\n\n        to follow RIF procedures set forth by statute and regulation to carry out the terminations. See 5\n\n        U.S.C. \u00a7 3502; 5 C.F.R. Part 351.\n\n        226.   Defendants violated the law by carrying out the mass terminations of probationary\n\n        employees without following the required RIF procedures, see 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502; 5 C.F.R. Part 351,\n\n        including providing 60 days\u2019 notice to states and affected employees before releasing the\n\n        employees, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d). Absent such notice, an employee \u201cmay not be released.\u201d 5 U.S.C.\n\n        \u00a7 3502(d).\n\n        227.   The actions of Defendants therefore violate the APA because they are not in accordance\n\n        with law in violation of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A).\n\n\n                                                          47\n                                                     ADD.136\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 34     Filed: 04/04/2025 Pg: 171 of 194\n             Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA Document 1 Filed 03/06/25 Page 48 of 55\n\n\n\n                                                  COUNT II\n                                Violation of the Administrative Procedures Act\n                                           Arbitrary and Capricious\n\n        228.   Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate herein by reference every allegation and paragraph set\n\n        forth previously.\n\n        229.   Under the APA, a court shall \u201chold unlawful and set aside agency action . . . found to be\n\n        . . . arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d 5 U.S.C.\n\n        \u00a7 706(2)(A).\n\n        230.   Defendants are agencies subject to the APA. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701.\n\n        231.   The terminations of probationary employees pursuant to OPM\u2019s order have been arbitrary\n\n        and capricious in several respects, including:\n\n        232.   Defendants OPM and OPM Director failed to provide a reasoned explanation for their\n\n        direction to agencies to carry out mass terminations of probationary employees without following\n\n        RIF procedures.\n\n        233.   Defendants failed to provide a reasoned explanation for following OPM\u2019s direction and\n\n        carrying out mass terminations of probationary employees.\n\n        234.   Third, to the extent Defendants provided any explanation at all for the mass terminations,\n\n        the reasons given were pretextual as they purported to relate to individual employees\u2019 performance\n\n        but did not identify any actual unsatisfactory performance or conduct or any reasons preceding the\n\n        affected employees\u2019 appointments that justified their terminations. Rather than Defendants\u2019 stated\n\n        reasons, Defendants\u2019 true reason for terminating the probationary employees was to reduce the\n\n        size of the federal workforce.\n\n        235.   The arbitrariness of Defendants\u2019 actions and the indiscriminate nature of the terminations\n\n        is underscored by the fact that Defendants have had to reverse the firings of individuals fulfilling\n\n\n\n\n                                                          48\n                                                     ADD.137\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 34     Filed: 04/04/2025 Pg: 172 of 194\n             Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA Document 1 Filed 03/06/25 Page 49 of 55\n\n\n\n        certain critical functions, such as protecting nuclear weapons and addressing a significant public\n\n        health threat.\n\n                                                 COUNT III\n                                      Non-Statutory Review of Ultra Vires Action\n\n        236.    Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate herein by reference every allegation and paragraph set\n\n        forth previously.\n\n        237.    Plaintiffs have a non-statutory right of action to enjoin and declare unlawful official action\n\n        that is ultra vires.\n\n        238.    Defendants mass terminations of probationary employees were RIFs. These RIFs were\n\n        unlawful because Defendants conducted them without following required RIF procedures, see 5\n\n        U.S.C. \u00a7 3502; 5 C.F.R. Part 351, including providing 60 days\u2019 notice to states and affected\n\n        employees before releasing the employees, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d). Absent such notice, an employee\n\n        \u201cmay not be released.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d).\n\n        239.    Defendants\u2019 actions terminating probationary employees en masse therefore exceeded their\n\n        lawful authority and were ultra vires.\n\n        240.    Plaintiffs will suffer irreparable injury if Defendants\u2019 actions are not declared unlawful and\n\n        enjoined, and Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law.\n\n        241.    The public interest favors issuance of a judicial declaration that Defendants\u2019 terminations\n\n        of federal probationary employees are unlawful and issuance of an injunction requiring Defendants\n\n        to reinstate the affected employees and to follow RIF procedures for any further RIFs. Defendants\u2019\n\n        actions have resulted in the unlawful termination of tens of thousands of probationary federal\n\n        employees, including large numbers of military veterans, causing a sudden surge of unemployment\n\n        without providing Plaintiff States with notice or an opportunity to prepare.\n\n\n\n\n                                                         49\n                                                    ADD.138\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 34     Filed: 04/04/2025 Pg: 173 of 194\n             Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA Document 1 Filed 03/06/25 Page 50 of 55\n\n\n\n                                           PRAYER FOR RELIEF\n\n               WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court:\n\n        242.   Declare unlawful and set aside Defendants\u2019 terminations of probationary employees\n\n        without making specific, individualized determinations regarding the employees\u2019 performance or\n\n        conduct and without adhering to RIF requirements as arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion,\n\n        or otherwise not in accordance with law under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A);\n\n        243.   Declare unlawful and set aside Defendants\u2019 terminations of probationary employees\n\n        without making specific, individualized determinations regarding the employees\u2019 performance or\n\n        conduct and without adhering to RIF requirements as ultra vires and exceeding their lawful\n\n        authority;\n\n        244.   Issue immediate temporary relief restraining Defendants from terminating any\n\n        probationary employees without making specific, individualized determinations regarding the\n\n        inadequacy of the employee\u2019s conduct or performance and reinstating probationary employees\n\n        who were terminated on or after January 20, 2025, as part of mass terminations that did not comply\n\n        with RIF procedures and were not based on individualized determinations of the inadequacy of the\n\n        employee\u2019s conduct or performance;\n\n        245.   Order Defendants to file a status report with the Court within 48 hours of entry of a\n\n        temporary restraining order, and at regular intervals thereafter, identifying all probationary\n\n        employees terminated on or after January 20, 2025 (including the following information for each\n\n        employee: agency, name, position title, grade, termination date, whether the probationary\n\n        employee has been reinstated, and the date of any reinstatement), and reporting all steps that\n\n        Defendants have taken to comply with the Court\u2019s temporary restraining order;\n\n\n\n\n                                                       50\n                                                  ADD.139\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 34     Filed: 04/04/2025 Pg: 174 of 194\n             Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA Document 1 Filed 03/06/25 Page 51 of 55\n\n\n\n        246.   Enter preliminary and permanent injunctive relief enjoining any further terminations that\n\n        do not follow the RIF requirements or requirements for separating probationary employees for\n\n        performance and enjoining Defendants from separating any employees pursuant to a RIF prior to\n\n        the reinstatement of the probationary employees described above;\n\n        247.    Award to Plaintiffs their costs of litigation including, but not limited to, reasonable\n\n        attorneys\u2019 fees, under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412, and any other applicable law; and\n\n        248.

Attach additional page if necessary.)\n         Plaintiffs are nineteen states and the District of Columbia. Plaintiffs have sued twenty-one\n         federal agencies, alleging that those agencies' terminations of certain probationary federal\n         employees amounted to a reduction in force of which the plaintiff jurisdictions were entitled to\n         advance notice. On March 13, 2025, the district court entered an order requiring the\n         immediate reinstatement of thousands of employees at nearly all of those agencies.\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248         Doc: 30            Filed: 03/31/2025         Pg: 3 of 6\n\n\n\n\n         Issues (Non-binding statement of issues on appeal. Attach additional page if necessary)\n\n         The issues on appeal will include whether the plaintiffs had Article III standing, whether the\n         district court was divested of jurisdiciton pursuant to the Civil Service Reform Act and the\n         Federal Service-Labor Management Relations Statute, whether the plaintiffs were likely to\n         suceed on the merits of their claims, whether the equitable factors otherwise supported\n         preliminary relief, and whether the district court properly ordered relief on a nationwide basis.\n\n\n\n\n         Adverse Parties (List adverse parties to this appeal and their attorneys; provide party=s address if the\n         party is not represented by counsel.

The government raises serious questions about whether the district court\u2019s\n\ntemporary restraining order is actually an appealable injunction, at least in part. But given\n\nthe timing of the government\u2019s stay motion and the district court\u2019s anticipated ruling on\n\npreliminary injunctive relief, I agree that denying the motion in this posture is the prudent\n\ncourse.\n\n       I write separately to echo the growing concerns over district courts issuing\n\nnationwide injunctions to order redress for those who have not sought it. The district court\n\nhere required numerous federal agencies to reinstate fired probationary workers across all\n\n50 States. It ordered relief because Plaintiffs\u2014which are 19 States and the District of\n\nColumbia\u2014asserted an injury stemming from the federal government\u2019s failure to notify\n\nthe States of its intent to fire probationary employees within their territory. But the district\n\ncourt extended its injunction to cover non-plaintiff States because (1) \u201cthe Government\u2019s\n\npolicy is violative of the law across the board,\u201d and (2) it \u201cwould be inequitable\u201d for a\n\nfederal employee\u2019s status to turn on \u201cthe fortuity of their physical location.\u201d State of\n\nMaryland v. USDA, 1:25-cv-748, slip op. at 48 (D. Md. Mar. 13, 2025).\n\n       Neither reason holds water. As the district court noted, federal law requires an\n\nagency to notify a State of a reduction in force (RIF) when 50 or more employees in a\n\n\u201ccompetitive area\u201d\u2014a unit definable by the agency but which must be linked to\n\ngeography\u2014receive separation notices. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 351.803(b), 351.405; see 5 U.S.C.\n\n\u00a7 3502(d)(3). Plaintiffs identify no allegations or evidence before the district court\n\n                                               4\n\fshowing that 50 or more employees were terminated in competitive areas in non-plaintiff\n\nStates\u2014that is, the 31 States that opted not to join this lawsuit. Accordingly, the court had\n\nno basis to conclude that the government violated federal law by failing to notify those\n\nStates about any RIFs, and consequently no basis to conclude that the government\u2019s actions\n\nwere illegal \u201cacross the board.\u201d\n\n       Further, the district court lost sight of who the Plaintiffs are and what injury they\n\nclaim when it concluded a nationwide injunction was warranted. The States seek redress\n\nfor their own purported injuries flowing from the lack of notice, not for an injury to their\n\ncitizens. Accordingly, the question is not whether it is inequitable for a federal employee\u2019s\n\nreinstatement to turn on his State of residence, but rather whether it is inequitable to redress\n\nnotice-based injuries only for those States that actually claim to be injured by the lack of\n\nnotice. Of course not.\n\n\n\n\n                                               5\n\f",

Nothing in the states\u2019\n\nopposition undermines any of those points, and this Court should enter\n\na stay pending appeal and an immediate administrative stay.\n\n                              ARGUMENT\n\nI.   This Court Has Appellate Jurisdiction.\n\n     The states are correct that TROs are \u201cgenerally\u201d and \u201cordinarily\u201d\n\nnot appealable, Resp. 2, 11, but as their own authority acknowledges,\n\nthere are \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d in which that rule does not apply.\n\nDrudge v. McKernon, 482 F.2d 1375, 1375 (4th Cir. 1973) (per curiam),\n\ncited in Resp. 11. This is such a case, for the district court\u2019s order had\n\nthe \u201c\u2018practical effect\u2019 of granting \u2026 an injunction.\u2019\u201d Abbott v. Perez, 585\n\nU.S. 579, 594 (2018). Indeed, despite their general observations about\n\nwhat it means for an order to disturb the status quo, the states ignore\n\nthe Supreme Court\u2019s determination that an order compelling the\n\n\u201cmandatory retention of [an employee] in the position from which she\n\fwas dismissed\u201d is an injunction. Sampson v. Murray, 415 U.S. 61, 74\n\n(1974).\n\n     Plaintiffs do not further their argument by insisting that the order\n\nis set to last, by its terms, until only March 27. See Resp. 11. The court\n\nissued a 56-page opinion that provides considered views on every legal\n\nissue disputed by the parties and granted plaintiffs the ultimate relief\n\nthey seek in this lawsuit: reinstatement of previously terminated\n\nprobationary employees across numerous agencies. See Sampson, 415\n\nU.S. at 87; accord, e.g., 11A Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller,\n\nFederal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 2951 (3d ed.) (explaining that \u201c[w]hen\n\nthe opposing party actually receives notice of the application for a\n\nrestraining order,\u201d and \u201cthere is an adversary hearing or the order is\n\nentered for an indeterminate length of time, the \u2018temporary restraining\n\norder\u2019 may be treated as a preliminary injunction.\u201d (emphasis added)).\n\nThat goes far beyond limited relief preserving the status quo \u201cjust so\n\nlong as is necessary to hold a\u201d preliminary injunction hearing, \u201cand no\n\nlonger.\u201d Hoechst Diafoil Co. v. Nan Ya Plastics Corp., 174 F.3d 411, 422\n\n(4th Cir. 1999) (quotation omitted). Every day that the order remains\n\nin effect \u201cthreaten[s] serious and perhaps irreparable harm if not\n\n\n                                    2\n\fimmediately reviewed,\u201d Abbott, 585 U.S. at 595, and the court\u2019s labeling\n\nof its order does not \u201cshield\u201d it \u201cfrom appellate review,\u201d Sampson, 415\n\nU.S. at 87. This Court should be exceptionally wary of a jurisdictional\n\nruling that would permit every district judge in this Circuit to bind the\n\nExecutive Branch for at least fourteen days before the government can\n\neven begin asking an appellate court for relief.\n\nII.   The Government Is Likely To Prevail On The Merits.\n\n      A.   The District Court Lacked Jurisdiction.\n\n           1.    Article III Standing\n\n      The states\u2019 cursory efforts to defend the district court\u2019s standing\n\nanalysis, see Resp. 16-17, are unavailing. As set out in our motion, the\n\ndistrict court rested its standing analysis on just one theory of injury\u2014\n\nan informational injury that led to downstream economic harms. But\n\nthat theory fails for multiple reasons.\n\n      At the outset, there is a basic mismatch between the informational\n\ninjury the states assert (failure to receive pre-termination notice) and\n\nthe sweeping remedy the district court imposed (reinstatement of\n\nthousands of terminated employees). Such relief does nothing to\n\nremedy the states\u2019 asserted informational injury because it does not\n\nprovide them the information that they alleged was not provided.\n                                   3\n\f     The states\u2019 only authority addressing informational injury, see\n\nLaufer v. Naranda Hotels, LLC, 60 F.4th 156, 171 (4th Cir. 2023),\n\ndemonstrates the point. Laufer was brought by a disabled plaintiff who\n\nalleged that a hotel website failed to comply with a regulation requiring\n\nit to \u201c[i]dentify and describe accessible features in the hotels and guest\n\nrooms.\u201d Id. at 159 (alteration in original) (quotation marks omitted).\n\nShe alleged that she \u201csuffered an informational injury\u201d because she had\n\nbeen deprived of \u201cinformation required to make meaningful choices for\n\ntravel.\u201d Id. at 160 (quotation marks omitted). She accordingly sought\n\n\u201cdeclaratory and injunctive relief,\u201d id. at 158\u2014in particular, an order\n\nrequiring the hotel \u201cto revise its websites to comply\u201d with the\n\nregulation. Complaint at 9, Laufer v. Naranda Hotels LLC, No. 1:20-cv-\n\n02136-CCB (D. Md. Aug. 17, 2020), ECF No. 4. The court accepted that\n\nLaufer had \u201calleged an informational injury that gives her Article III\n\nstanding to sue,\u201d Laufer, 60 F.4th at 166, and given the obvious\n\nconnection between the asserted injury (missing information) and the\n\nrequested relief (an order to provide it), the Court observed that the\n\ndefendant had not even contested redressability in district court, id. at\n\n167. The court\u2019s reinstatement order here, by contrast, does nothing to\n\n\n                                     4\n\fremedy the informational injury of which the states complain, and\n\nindeed that purported informational injury no longer existed by the\n\ntime the states filed their lawsuit.\n\n     The states\u2019 asserted \u201cinformational injury\u201d fails in any event. The\n\nstates never dispute that informational injury only suffices when it\n\ncauses \u201c\u2018real\u2019\u201d harms that \u201care of the type that have \u2018traditionally been\n\nregarded as providing a basis for a lawsuit in English or American\n\ncourts.\u2019\u201d Dreher v. Experian Info. Sols., Inc., 856 F.3d 337, 345 (4th Cir.\n\n2017) (quoting Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 578 U.S. 330, 340, 341) (2016));\n\nsee Mot. 13. The states\u2019 asserted downstream harms of \u201cdecreased tax\n\nrevenue,\u201d \u201cincreased reliance on state social service programs,\u201d a \u201csurge\n\nin unemployment claims,\u201d \u201cdisruptions to state programs depending on\n\nfederal workers,\u201d and \u201chasty rollout of rapid response protocols,\u201d see\n\nResp. 16, are not cognizable Article III injuries-in-fact, United States v.\n\nTexas, 599 U.S. 670, 680 n.3 (2023). Plaintiffs\u2019 only attempt to\n\ndistinguish Texas is their assertion that their injuries derive from their\n\n\u201cstatutory right to notice.\u201d Resp. 16. Yet the states\u2019 articulation of a\n\nstatutory basis for their claims cannot solve their problem under Article\n\nIII, which \u201crequires a concrete injury even in the context of a statutory\n\n\n                                       5\n\fviolation.\u201d Spokeo, 578 U.S. at 341; see also TransUnion, LLC v.\n\nRamirez, 594 U.S. 413, 426 (2021) (\u201cCongress\u2019s creation of a statutory\n\nprohibition or obligation and a cause of action does not relieve courts of\n\ntheir responsibility to independently decide whether a plaintiff has\n\nsuffered a concrete harm under Article III \u2026 .\u201d).\n\n           2.    Civil Service Reform Act Channeling\n\n     The district court\u2019s order compelling the government to reinstate\n\nthousands of terminated federal employees flouted the exclusive\n\nremedial scheme created by the Civil Service Reform Act and the\n\nFederal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute. The states\u2019 only\n\nreal defense of the district court\u2019s holding is to observe that Congress\n\ndid not provide states an opportunity to challenge federal employees\u2019\n\nterminations, Resp. 18-19, but that is exactly the point: in authorizing\n\nchallenges to employment decisions only by unions, employees, and\n\napplicants for employment, Congress deliberately denied review to\n\nanyone else. See Block v. Community Nutrition Inst., 467 U.S. 340\n\n(1984); United States v. Fausto, 484 U.S. 439 (1988). Indeed, if\n\nCongress had wanted to authorize review by other parties who suffer\n\ndownstream economic loss when a federal employee is terminated\u2014his\n\n\n                                     6\n\fstate of residence, his spouse, his creditors, etc.\u2014it could easily have\n\ndone so. The states thus plainly fall within a \u201cclass\u201d of parties\n\nconsciously denied the opportunity to seek review of federal employees\u2019\n\nterminations. Cf. Resp. 18 (emphasis omitted) (quoting Koretoff v.\n\nVilsack, 614 F.3d 532, 536 (D.C. Cir. 2010)).\n\n     The states\u2019 attempt to distinguish Block fails. See Resp. 19. They\n\nobserve that the statutory scheme in Block did not permit \u201cparticipation\n\nby consumers,\u201d id. (quoting Block, 467 U.S. at 347), but the same is true\n\nof states here; no provision of the CSRA creates an \u201cexpress provision\n\nfor participation\u201d by states, Block, 467 U.S. at 347. While federal law\n\nmay require notice to states of certain reductions in force, see Resp. 19,\n\nit nowhere provides that states may enforce this notice obligation in\n\neither an administrative or a judicial proceeding. And while plaintiffs\n\nattempt to distance their claim from a \u201cgarden-variety employment\n\nclaim[],\u201d id., their arguments confirm that at bottom they seek to\n\nchallenge federal personnel decisions, see Resp. 14-15.\n\n     B.    The Government Did Not Conduct A Reduction\n           In Force Requiring Notice To States.\n\n     Plaintiffs do not rehabilitate the district court\u2019s flawed conclusion\n\nthat agencies\u2019 terminations of probationary employees amounted to an\n\n                                     7\n\funannounced reduction in force. A reduction in force does not occur\n\nwhenever the government terminates a large number of employees.\n\nMot. 17-18. Instead, a reduction in force authorizes an agency to\n\nrelease an employee when such release \u201cis required because of lack of\n\nwork; shortage of funds; insufficient personnel ceiling; reorganization;\n\nthe exercise of reemployment rights or restoration rights; or\n\nreclassification of an employee\u2019s position d[u]e to erosion of duties.\u201d 5\n\nC.F.R. \u00a7 351.201(a)(2). The district court speculated that the\n\ngovernment must have engaged in \u201csome form of reorganization.\u201d Dkt.\n\nNo. 43, at 38 (Op.). But it cited no record evidence for that conclusion,\n\nand plaintiffs\u2019 opposition makes no substantial attempt to defend it.\n\n     Plaintiffs instead echo the district court\u2019s conclusion that a\n\nreduction in force must have occurred because the \u201cterminated\n\nprobationary employees were plainly not terminated for cause.\u201d Op. 33;\n\nsee also Resp. 14 (suggesting that agencies were not \u201chonestly \u2026\n\ndissatisfied\u201d with employees\u2019 performance (quotation marks omitted)).\n\nThe government\u2019s motion explained why that theory fails, and plaintiffs\n\ndo not offer any meaningful response. Mot. 17-18. Even if it were true\n\nthat the government lacked sufficient cause to fire probationary\n\n\n                                     8\n\femployees, that would not mean that the government had in fact\n\nconducted an unlawful reduction in force without notice to states\u2014it\n\nwould mean that the agencies\u2019 terminations were unlawful, a claim that\n\nmay be pursued by affected employees, not states seeking to enforce an\n\nunrelated and inapplicable notice requirement.\n\nIII. The Equitable Factors Favor A Stay.\n\n     Finally, the equitable factors favor a stay. As set out above, the\n\nstates do not suffer Article III injury when the federal government\n\nterminates certain of their citizens\u2019 employment, see supra pp.3-6, let\n\nalone irreparable harm sufficient to justify a preliminary injunction,\n\ncontra Resp. 21-22. Nor do the states dispute that every day this court\u2019s\n\ninjunction remains in place, the government is obligated to continue\n\npaying thousands of employees it had previously terminated, with no\n\npractical mechanism to recoup those funds if it prevails on appeal\u2014a\n\nproblem exacerbated by the district court\u2019s failure to require each\n\nplaintiff state to post more than a nominal $100 bond. Beyond that, the\n\ninjunction intrudes on the internal management of the government,\n\nwhich has \u201ctraditionally been granted the widest latitude in the\n\n\u2018dispatch of its own internal affairs.\u2019\u201d Sampson, 415 U.S. at 83.\n\n\n                                    9\n\f     Instead of disputing these points, the states fault the government\n\nfor the timing of its stay motion and observe that the government has\n\nalready endeavored to comply with the TRO. Resp. 1, 20-21. The\n\ngovernment\u2019s staggering efforts to comply with the court\u2019s order in less\n\nthan two business days, however, only underscore the sweeping nature\n\nof the court\u2019s relief. See generally Dkt. No. 52 (documenting the\n\ngovernment\u2019s efforts to comply with the TRO).1 And although past\n\nharms cannot be undone, that is not a reason for this Court to leave the\n\ndistrict court\u2019s order in place as harms to the government and the\n\npublic interest mount. As the government\u2019s motion explained, the\n\nharms to the government\u2014including both unrecoverable financial loss\n\nand the baseless intrusion by a federal court on a coordinate branch of\n\ngovernment\u2019s authority to manage its own workforce\u2014continue every\n\nday that the district court\u2019s order remains in effect.\n\n\n\n\n     1 To the extent the states suggest the government delayed seeking\n\nreview in this Court, that is incorrect. The TRO was entered after the\nclose of business on Thursday, March 13. See Dkt. No. 44. The\ngovernment filed its notice of appeal at 4:18 p.m. the following day, see\nDkt. No. 46, but the district court did not transmit it to this Court until\n1:25 p.m. on Monday, see Dkt. No. 51, after which the government\npromptly filed its stay motion.\n                                     10\n\f     The states\u2019 attempt to invoke injuries to \u201cterminated probationary\n\nemployees,\u201d see Resp. 22, is unavailing. Those individuals are not\n\nparties to this action, and the states concede that they are not suing on\n\ntheir behalf, see Resp. 16. And as our motion explained, many of those\n\nemployees are endeavoring to pursue their own claims pursuant to the\n\nstatutory scheme that Congress enacted. See Mot. 17-18.\n\n     At an absolute minimum, the states offer no principled\n\njustification for the district court\u2019s entry of nationwide relief, which\n\nextends to 31 states that did not join this action. While this Court has\n\nupheld nationwide injunctions in some cases, see Resp. 23 (citing CASA,\n\nInc. v. Trump, No. 25-1153, 2025 WL 654902, at *1 (4th Cir. Feb. 28,\n\n2025)), the states offer no explanation of why relief that only applied\n\nwithin the plaintiff states would fail to provide them complete relief,\n\nwould cause confusion, or would be anything other than \u201cclear and\n\ndefinite,\u201d id. The very nature of both our constitutional structure (with\n\nits 50 separate states) and the federal courts (with twelve geographic\n\ncircuits) presupposes that different legal regimes may apply in different\n\nparts of the country at different times. The states fail to explain why, if\n\n\n\n\n                                     11\n\fa nationwide injunction is warranted in this case, it would not be\n\nwarranted in every case challenging federal government action.\n\n                            CONCLUSION\n\n     The Court should stay the preliminary injunction pending appeal\n\nand enter an immediate administrative stay pending consideration of\n\nthis motion.\n\n                                        Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                        YAAKOV M.

The Agencies pepper their stay\n\n        request with rhetoric about \u201cextraordinary incursion[s]\u201d and \u201csignificant burdens.\u201d\n\n        Mot. 2. Yet their own actions convey little urgency: Their stay request was filed in\n\n        this Court four days after the TRO\u2019s issuance and several hours after the compliance\n\n        deadline. At this point, with many employees restored to their previous positions,\n\n        granting a stay would make no sense.\n\n              Rather, allowing the TRO to remain in place is the only equitable path\n\n        forward. Doing so mitigates the chaos of the Agencies\u2019 own making that has\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248     Doc: 16        Filed: 03/19/2025     Pg: 2 of 30\n\n\n\n\n        significantly strained Appellee States\u2019 resources. In brief, the Agencies recently\n\n        terminated over 24,000 federal probationary employees through unlawful reductions\n\n        in force (\u201cRIFs\u201d). They did so without the notice to the States that federal law\n\n        requires. States have been left to clean up the mess caused by the spike in\n\n        unemployment insurance claims and demand for public services. Although the\n\n        Agencies deride these injuries as mere \u201cinformational\u201d harms, Mot. 1, the record is\n\n        replete with evidence of the strain and budgetary harms incurred by the States.\n\n        Recognizing that the Agencies\u2019 conduct was forbidden by clear statutory and\n\n        regulatory text, the district court acted to maintain the status quo ante by temporarily\n\n        restraining the Agencies from continuing their string of unlawful mass firings and\n\n        temporarily reinstating the terminated probationary employees.\n\n              This Court should deny the stay. First, there is no basis to exercise appellate\n\n        jurisdiction at this stage, because orders granting TROs are ordinarily\n\n        unappealable. There is no reason to deviate from that rule here.\n\n              Second, the Agencies fail to satisfy any of the criteria for the extraordinary\n\n        relief they seek. The law is clear: When federal agencies restructure themselves by\n\n        engaging in mass terminations, they must follow statutorily prescribed RIF\n\n        procedures, including giving States notice to enable them to deploy federally\n\n        mandated support services to aid those employees. Here, the Agencies abruptly\n\n        terminated thousands of employees within the States\u2019 borders without any notice,\n\n                                                   2\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248     Doc: 16        Filed: 03/19/2025    Pg: 3 of 30\n\n\n\n\n        resulting in significant irreparable injury. Further, the Agencies cannot establish\n\n        their own irreparable injury in the absence of a stay. Not only have they already\n\n        taken steps to comply with the order, but the TRO\u2019s relief simply encompasses the\n\n        continued employment of personnel whom they previously hired.\n\n              Finally, the balance of the equities and the public interest cut firmly against a\n\n        stay. There is no public interest in unlawful government action. Nor should the\n\n        States shoulder the administrative burden of locating, supporting, and offering\n\n        unemployment benefits to thousands of illegally terminated employees while the\n\n        Agencies continue their campaign to gut the federal workforce without following\n\n        the requisite procedures. The motion to stay should be denied.\n\n                                    STATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\n              Legal Framework\n\n                     Probationary Employees\n\n              New employees and certain employees who have changed offices or recently\n\n        received   promotions     are   subject   to   probationary   periods.      5   U.S.C.\n\n        \u00a7 7511(a)(1)(A)(ii), (C)(ii).

OPM reiterated that demand a day later and drafted a\n\n        template termination letter for agencies to send to their probationary employees\n\n        (DiMartini Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 10, 13), informing the employees that their \u201cunsatisfactory\n\n        performance was the reason for removal\u201d (ECF 4-36, Grant Decl. \u00b6 11).\n\n              Agencies have obeyed, firing over 24,000 probationary employees as of the\n\n        filing of the complaint, with more terminations expected.          (ECF 1, Compl.\n\n        \u00b6\u00b6 102-40.) Each termination occurred without proper notice to the States.\n\n              In carrying out the terminations, the Agencies largely relied on OPM\u2019s\n\n                                                  7\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248    Doc: 16        Filed: 03/19/2025      Pg: 8 of 30\n\n\n\n\n        template language, which generally stated that the employees were being terminated\n\n        because their \u201cability, knowledge and skills do not fit the Agency\u2019s current needs,\n\n        and [their] performance has not been adequate to justify further employment.\u201d (ECF\n\n        33-2, Redacted Decl. \u00b6 5; see DiMartini Decl. \u00b6 13.)\n\n              These terminations were not based on individualized findings regarding the\n\n        employees\u2019 performance.2 As a former IRS human capital officer explained, \u201cit\n\n        would take weeks or months to evaluate the job performance of [thousands of]\n\n        employees.\u201d (DiMartini Decl. \u00b6 14.) Indeed, leadership \u201cdiscussed openly in\n\n        meetings\u201d that the agency \u201cdid not review or consider the actual job performance or\n\n        conduct\u201d of any terminated probationary employee. (DiMartini \u00b6 14Decl. \u00b6 16; ECF\n\n        4-36, Grant Decl. \u00b6 19 (similar as to another agency)). In fact, some agencies have\n\n        now confirmed that the terminations were not for cause but instead due to a\n\n        \u201creduction in force\u201d or a \u201cpermanent lack of work due to a change in Presidential\n\n        Administration.\u201d (Maryland Labor Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 61-62.)\n\n                    Spikes in Unemployment and Demand for Public Services\n\n              Many States have seen material increases in the number of unemployment\n\n        claims filed by former federal employees compared to the same period last year.\n\n\n\n\n              2\n                Many employees purportedly terminated for performance had recently\n        received stellar reviews.

(See, e.g., Maryland Labor Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 16,\n\n        19-23; ECF 4-11, New Jersey Labor Decl. 16\u2011\u00b6\u00b6 17-18.) Some are also diverting\n\n        staff from pressing projects to retrain them to provide rapid response services. (See,\n\n        e.g., Maryland Labor Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 24-28.) Others have created new websites or set up\n\n        dedicated phone lines to find and assist terminated federal employees.

(ECF\n\n        4-1, at 3\u20114.) Following a hearing, on Thursday, March 13, the district court granted\n\n        the States\u2019 motion with respect to all but three defendants and denied the Agencies\u2019\n\n        request for a stay pending appeal.3 The Agencies appealed the following day.\n\n              Not until Monday, March 17, at around 5:30 p.m.\u2014well after the 1:00 p.m.\n\n        TRO compliance deadline (ECF 44 \u00b6 3)\u2014did the Agencies request a stay of that\n\n        order in this Court. Shortly thereafter, the Agencies filed a status report in the district\n\n        court stating that they had rescinded many of the terminations and acknowledging\n\n        that the terminations were not actually due to performance. (See, e.g., ECF 52-1, at\n\n        14 (explaining that Department of Homeland Security\u2019s report of 313 probationary\n\n        employee terminations \u201cexcludes [those] terminated in individualized actions based\n\n        on their performance\u201d); ECF 52-1, at 18 n.1 (similar); ECF 52-1, at 44 (similar).)\n\n\n\n\n              3\n                The district court excluded the Department of Defense, the National\n        Archives and Records Administration, and OPM but noted that its conclusion was\n        without prejudice to the presentation of additional evidence.

THE COURT SHOULD DENY A STAY FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION.\n\n              An order granting a TRO is generally not appealable. Drudge v. McKernon,\n\n        482 F.2d 1375, 1376 (4th Cir. 1973) (\u201c[W]e are aware of [no authority], that, as a\n\n        general rule, the granting . . . of a motion for a temporary restraining order is an\n\n        appealable order.\u201d). The Agencies do not contest that principle, Mot. 10, and there\n\n        is no reason to depart from it here.\n\n              The Agencies\u2019 attempt to recast the TRO as an appealable preliminary\n\n        injunction is unpersuasive, for they gloss over the key distinction between\n\n        preliminary injunctions and TROs: duration. While a preliminary injunction \u201cis of\n\n        indefinite duration extending during the litigation,\u201d TROs are \u201climited in duration.\u201d\n\n        U.S. Dep\u2019t of Lab. v. Wolf Run Mining Co., 452 F.3d 275, 281 n.1 (4th Cir. 2006).\n\n        Absent a motion for an extension, the TRO at issue here is set to expire after the\n\n        standard 14-day period\u2014in a mere 8 days\u2014and the district court has ordered that\n\n        any hearing on a motion for preliminary injunction shall occur within that window.\n\n        (ECF 44 \u00b6\u00b6 7, 9.) This TRO thus bears no resemblance to a preliminary injunction\n\n        of indefinite duration. Indeed, if this Court were to order briefing and consider an\n\n        appeal on the merits, the issue would likely become moot before a single brief could\n\n        be filed. And issuing a stay pending review of a near-expired order over which this\n\n        court lacks jurisdiction would make little sense.\n\n                                                 11\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248     Doc: 16        Filed: 03/19/2025     Pg: 12 of 30\n\n\n\n\n              Contrary to the Agencies\u2019 assertions, the scope of relief granted by the district\n\n        court did not convert this TRO into a preliminary injunction.           To begin, the\n\n        Agencies\u2019 assertion that the TRO requires them to take affirmative action misses the\n\n        mark. Mot. 11. As the district court explained, an order reverting to the status quo\n\n        ante is not a mandatory injunction and does not exceed the bounds of permissible\n\n        TRO relief. (ECF 43, at 45-46); see Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(d)(1)(C) (requiring that TROs\n\n        describe the acts \u201crestrained or required\u201d). The status quo ante to be preserved by\n\n        interim relief is \u201cthe last uncontested status between the parties which preceded the\n\n        controversy.\u201d League of Women Voters of N.C. v. North Carolina, 769 F.3d 224,\n\n        236 (4th Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n              Here, the status quo ante is the period before the unlawful mass terminations.\n\n        Were it otherwise, the Agencies would perversely benefit from breaking the law\n\n        quickly and without notice, placing their actions beyond the scope of immediate\n\n        relief\u2014or entitling them to an immediate appeal unavailable to more circumspect\n\n        defendants.

The Agencies Are Not Likely to Prevail on the Merits.\n\n              As the district court explained, federal agencies may terminate probationary\n\n        employees for three reasons: (1) conditions arising before their employment, 5\n\n        C.F.R. \u00a7 315.805; (2) unsatisfactory performance or conduct, id. \u00a7 315.804(a); and\n\n        (3) in accordance with a RIF, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502. (ECF 43, at 2-3.) The Agencies\n\n        chose the third option but ignored the legal requirements governing RIFs, instead\n\n        issuing boilerplate letters claiming employees were terminated due to performance.\n\n              That reasoning was plainly pretext, as the district court concluded based on\n\n        extensive record evidence. To terminate probationary employees for unsatisfactory\n\n        performance, employers \u201cmust honestly be dissatisfied with the probationer\u2019s\n\n        conduct or performance after giving him a fair trial on the job.\u201d McGuffin, 942 F.3d\n\n        at 1102 (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, the Agencies\u2019\n\n        claim that they evaluated performance is overwhelmingly refuted by the evidence\u2014\n\n        including OPM\u2019s directive to terminate, not evaluate, employees (DiMartini Decl.\n\n        \u00b6 5); declarations of agency officials stating that individual assessments were not\n\n        undertaken (ECF 4-36, Grant Decl. \u00b6 19; DiMartini Decl. \u00b6 16); employee\n\n        declarations revealing exemplary evaluations shortly before termination, see note 2\n\n        above; the Agencies\u2019 admission that many employees were terminated due to a\n\n        \u201creduction in force\u201d (Maryland Labor Decl. \u00b6 62); the district court\u2019s factual\n\n        determination that \u201c[t]he sheer number of employees that were terminated in a matter\n\n                                                14\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248    Doc: 16        Filed: 03/19/2025   Pg: 15 of 30\n\n\n\n\n        of days belies any argument that these terminations were due to the employees\u2019\n\n        individual unsatisfactory performance or conduct\u201d (ECF 43, at 33); and the\n\n        Agencies\u2019 own status-report declarations confirming that hundreds of employees\n\n        were not \u201cterminated in individualized actions based on their performance\u201d (ECF\n\n        52-1, at 14). These terminations, conducted en masse due to a \u201cpermanent lack of\n\n        work\u201d and without any individualized performance assessments, were transparently\n\n        large-scale RIFs. (Maryland Labor Decl. \u00b6 61.)\n\n              The Agencies do not dispute that they are required to provide advance notice\n\n        to states to enact such RIFs. Mot. 4. RIFs affecting 50 or more employees require\n\n        advance notice to \u201cthe State or entity designated by the State to carry out rapid\n\n        response activities.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d)(3)(A)(i); 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.803(b)(1). To\n\n        mitigate the burden on state resources, Congress sought to aid States in proactively\n\n        assisting soon-to-be terminated residents. Indeed, the Agencies conceded as much\n\n        below. (3/12/25 Tr. at 23-24.) Yet the Agencies failed to comply with these clear\n\n        requirements, and they nowhere suggest otherwise. Because the Agencies\u2019 legal\n\n        violations are clear and obvious, they have no likelihood of success on the merits.\n\n        See CASA, Inc. v. Trump, No. 25-1153, 2025 WL 654902, at *1 (4th Cir. Feb. 28,\n\n        2025) (denying stay request for failure to make \u201cstrong showing\u201d of likelihood of\n\n        success given that \u201ccircuit precedent foreclose[d] the government\u2019s position\u201d).\n\n\n\n\n                                                15\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248     Doc: 16        Filed: 03/19/2025    Pg: 16 of 30\n\n\n\n\n              The Agencies advance two jurisdictional arguments for why they are likely to\n\n        succeed, but neither comes close to the \u201cstrong showing\u201d needed to grant a stay. See\n\n        Nken, 556 U.S. at 434. First, the Agencies contend that the States lack Article III\n\n        standing. That is wrong, for several reasons. To start, the Agencies mischaracterize\n\n        the issue, asserting that States are \u201csu[ing] the federal government on behalf of their\n\n        citizens as parens patriae.\u201d Mot. 11. This is not a suit in which the States have\n\n        attempted to vindicate a right that they themselves do not possess or to \u201crepresent\n\n        the interests of particular citizens who, for whatever reason, cannot represent\n\n        themselves.\u201d Alfred L. Snapp & Son, Inc. v. Puerto Rico ex rel. Barez, 458 U.S. 592,\n\n        600 (1982). To the contrary, the States have asserted a direct injury based on their\n\n        own right to advance notice under the RIF statutes and regulations.\n\n              The Agencies\u2019 reliance on United States v. Texas, 599 U.S. 670 (2023), also\n\n        is unpersuasive. The States\u2019 injury-in-fact is an informational one that has caused\n\n        specific harms, including (1) costs from the hasty rollout of rapid-response\n\n        protocols; (2) burdens associated with processing an unanticipated surge in\n\n        unemployment claims; (3) sudden disruptions to state programs depending on\n\n        federal workers; and (4) unexpected financial harms from decreased tax revenue and\n\n        increased reliance on state social service programs. (ECF 43, at 7-11.) These are\n\n        cognizable injuries that flow directly from the statutory right to notice that Congress\n\n        provided the States, not \u201cattenuated\u201d or \u201cindirect\u201d harms associated with the federal\n\n                                                  16\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248     Doc: 16        Filed: 03/19/2025   Pg: 17 of 30\n\n\n\n\n        government\u2019s decision to alter enforcement and prosecutorial priorities like those at\n\n        issue in Texas. See 599 U.S. at 680 n.3; Laufer v. Naranda Hotels, LLC, 60 F.4th\n\n        156, 171 (4th Cir. 2023) (recognizing Article III injury from the deprivation of\n\n        information required to be disclosed by statute). And contrary to the Agencies\u2019\n\n        assertion, Mot. 14, the States continue to seek information with respect to the\n\n        unlawfully terminated employees to meet their own federal and state statutory\n\n        obligations to provide rapid response services to those affected. The States thus have\n\n        standing.\n\n              Second, contrary to the Agencies\u2019 contentions, the Federal Service Labor-\n\n        Management Relations Statute and the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (\u201cCSRA\u201d)\n\n        do not preclude federal court jurisdiction. Mot. 14-17. Though ignored by the\n\n        Agencies, Thunder Basin Coal Co. v. Reich sets forth the well-established, two-step\n\n        framework for determining whether Congress has divested jurisdiction over agency\n\n        action. See 510 U.S. 200, 207 (1994). A court must first \u201cask whether Congress\u2019s\n\n        intent to preclude district-court jurisdiction is fairly discernible in the statutory\n\n        scheme.\u201d Bennett v. SEC, 844 F.3d 174, 181 (4th Cir. 2016). It next asks \u201cwhether\n\n        plaintiffs\u2019 claims are of the type Congress intended to be reviewed within this\n\n        statutory structure.\u201d Id. At this second step, the court considers three factors: \u201c(1)\n\n        whether the statutory scheme forecloses all meaningful judicial review\u201d; \u201c(2) the\n\n        extent to which the plaintiff\u2019s claims are wholly collateral to the statute\u2019s review\n\n                                                 17\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248     Doc: 16         Filed: 03/19/2025    Pg: 18 of 30\n\n\n\n\n        provisions\u201d; and \u201c(3) whether agency expertise could be brought to bear on\n\n        the . . . questions presented.\u201d   Id.   \u201c[M]eaningful judicial review is the most\n\n        important factor.\u201d Id. at 183 n.7.\n\n              Application of the Thunder Basin factors confirms that the district court had\n\n        jurisdiction here. At step one, the \u201ctext, structure, and purpose\u201d of the CSRA do not\n\n        display a \u201cfairly discernible\u201d intent to limit jurisdiction over the States\u2019 claims. See\n\n        Elgin v. Department of Treasury, 567 U.S. 1, 10 (2012). The CSRA\u2019s administrative\n\n        tribunals\u2014the Merit Systems Protection Board and the Federal Labor Relations\n\n        Authority\u2014are available only to employees, labor organizations, and agencies. .\n\n        5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7103(a)(1)-(2); id. \u00a7 7123; id. \u00a7 7703. Yet States have clear statutory\n\n        rights to notice, making it illogical to conclude that Congress intended CSRA\n\n        preclusion to encompass suits like this one. See Franklin v. Gwinnett Cnty. Pub.\n\n        Sch., 503 U.S. 60, 66-67 (1992); Koretoff v. Vilsack, 614 F.3d 532, 536 (D.C. Cir.\n\n        2010) (no preclusion where Congress did not \u201cforeclose[] review to the class to\n\n        which the plaintiff belongs\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis added)).\n\n              Even if this Court were to proceed to step two, the CSRA still would not\n\n        preclude this suit. ECF 43, at 27-30.) If the district court lacked jurisdiction, the\n\n        States would be left without review and without a remedy because they cannot\n\n        litigate in the relevant administrative tribunals. Further, the States\u2019 claims about\n\n        notice are \u201cwholly collateral\u201d to the CSRA\u2019s administrative review scheme, Thunder\n\n                                                  18\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248      Doc: 16        Filed: 03/19/2025     Pg: 19 of 30\n\n\n\n\n        Basin, 510 U.S. at 212, because notice to States has \u201cnothing to do with\u201d the labor-\n\n        related matters that the administrative tribunals \u201cregularly adjudicate\u201d between\n\n        unions, employees, and employers. Axon Enter., Inc. v. FTC, 598 U.S. 175, 193\n\n        (2023).     Lastly, the administrative tribunals specialize in individualized\n\n        adjudications of prototypical employee disputes and lack the expertise to handle the\n\n        States\u2019 claims\u2014i.e., that the Agencies are indiscriminately targeting a swath of the\n\n        federal workforce to gut the civil service without warning to the States.\n\n              The Agencies\u2019 reliance on cases involving ordinary employment disputes\n\n        between employees, unions, and employers is misguided. See Mot. 14-16 (citing,\n\n        e.g., United States v. Fausto, 484 U.S. 439 (1988)). The States are not asserting\n\n        garden-variety employment claims but, rather, are challenging the Agencies\u2019 failure\n\n        to provide them with statutorily required notice, which is not the \u201ctype of personnel\n\n        action covered by\u201d the CSRA. Fausto, 484 U.S. at 448. Block v. Community\n\n        Nutrition Institute, 467 U.S. 340 (1984), is similarly inapposite. See Mot. 15. There,\n\n        the statutory scheme allowed milk producers and handlers to participate in the\n\n        adoption of milk market orders, but \u201c[n]owhere in the Act\u201d permitted \u201cparticipation\n\n        by consumers.\u201d Block, 467 U.S. at 347. The Court thus concluded that consumers,\n\n        having no statutory rights, could not seek judicial review. Id. In contrast, here,\n\n        Congress expressly conferred on States the right to notice, and thus did not \u201cintend[]\n\n        to foreclose\u201d the States\u2019 ability to vindicate that right. Id.\n\n                                                   19\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248      Doc: 16      Filed: 03/19/2025    Pg: 20 of 30\n\n\n\n\n              B.       The Agencies Are Not Irreparably Harmed.\n\n              As to the equitable factors, the Agencies first contend that having to employ\n\n        \u201cindividuals whose services the government has determined it no longer requires\u201d\n\n        irreparably injures them. Mot. 19-20. That claim lacks merit. It improperly assumes\n\n        that the Agencies can immediately terminate employees whenever they wish to\n\n        downsize without following RIF procedures. The district court expressly found\n\n        otherwise. And the temporary reinstatement of employees who were likely\n\n        terminated unlawfully is just a return to the status quo ante. Accord Rodriguez v.\n\n        Robbins, 715 F.3d 1127, 1145 (9th Cir. 2013) (explaining that the government does\n\n        not suffer harm from restraint of an unlawful practice).\n\n              Further, reviving established employment relationships with probationary\n\n        employees who were only recently separated imposes minimal burdens. See League\n\n        of Women Voters, 769 F.3d at 248 (finding burden on government to restore status\n\n        quo was lessened because relevant \u201csystems have existed, do exist, and simply need\n\n        to be resurrected,\u201d and other measures \u201cmerely require[] the revival of previous\n\n        practices\u201d).    What is more, the Agencies claim to already be in substantial\n\n        compliance with the TRO. In fact, on March 17, they represented that they had\n\n        quickly reinstated most terminated probationary employees covered by the order.\n\n        While the Agencies now allege that unspecified \u201cadministrative tasks\u201d remain, Mot.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 20\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248       Doc: 16      Filed: 03/19/2025    Pg: 21 of 30\n\n\n\n\n        19, such vague workforce management duties cannot support the extraordinary\n\n        remedy of a stay.\n\n              C.     The Remaining Equitable Factors Cut Against the Agencies.\n\n              By contrast, staying the TRO would \u201csubstantially injure the other parties\n\n        interested in the proceeding,\u201d Nken, 556 U.S. at 426\u2014namely, the States, who are\n\n        responsible for providing rapid response services, as well as thousands of\n\n        probationary employees abruptly and unlawfully terminated. Similarly, the public\n\n        interest supports the States\u2019 request for relief. At this point, given the Agencies\u2019\n\n        representations that they have reinstated the bulk of their probationary employees, it\n\n        would be profoundly inequitable to terminate them again in connection with a\n\n        belated stay motion.\n\n              Each day that probationary employees are unemployed means rising and\n\n        likely unrecoverable costs for the States. As the district court found, the States have\n\n        suffered an informational injury and \u201chave incurred substantial follow-on harms as\n\n        a result of the [Agencies\u2019] failure to provide the required RIF notice.\u201d (ECF 43, at\n\n        14.) These harms include costs associated with diverting personnel for statutorily\n\n        required rapid response activities, managing and investigating an unanticipated\n\n        surge of federal unemployment claims, and the sudden loss of various employees\u2019\n\n        services. (ECF 43, at 15.)\n\n\n\n\n                                                  21\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248     Doc: 16        Filed: 03/19/2025   Pg: 22 of 30\n\n\n\n\n              The district court recognized that these harms are \u201ctemporal and immediate\u201d\n\n        (ECF 43, at 42), and tied to the States\u2019 legal obligations to provide rapid response\n\n        services and to otherwise discharge their responsibilities to their residents (ECF 43,\n\n        at 15). The Agencies\u2019 suggestion that preliminary relief is unnecessary because\n\n        terminated employees \u201cmay obtain back pay from the federal government,\u201d Mot. 20,\n\n        highlights again that this is not a personnel action, for back pay to employees would\n\n        not redress injuries to the States. As the Agencies conceded below, \u201cthe States\u2019\n\n        asserted injuries could only be conceivably redressed by [] reinstatement.\u201d (ECF 20,\n\n        at 12.14, 17). The district court agreed and ordered temporary reinstatement, which\n\n        mitigates the States\u2019 ongoing injuries. That decision temporarily pausing likely\n\n        unlawful conduct is plainly in the public interest. See Roe v. Department of Def.,\n\n        947 F.3d 207, 371 (4th Cir. 2020).\n\n              For terminated probationary employees, the injuries that would result from a\n\n        stay are manifest. Until the Agencies began complying with the TRO, many\n\n        employees remained out of the workforce and in limbo because of the Agencies\u2019\n\n        unlawful actions. Most have now been reinstated, and a stay pending appeal would\n\n        again subject them to a sudden, mass termination. Nor can the Agencies justify a\n\n        stay based on potential \u201cuncertainty\u201d on the part of returning employees. Mot. 19.\n\n        The affected employees will decide whether returning to work in the present\n\n\n\n\n                                                 22\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248     Doc: 16        Filed: 03/19/2025   Pg: 23 of 30\n\n\n\n\n        circumstances is in their best interest; the Agencies that fired them en masse should\n\n        not purport to speak for them.\n\n              Finally, the Agencies have not shown that the district court abused its \u201cwide\n\n        discretion\u201d in fashioning the scope of relief. CASA, Inc., 2025 WL 654902, at *1.\n\n        They suggest that a nationwide injunction is per se improper because this suit was\n\n        brought by \u201cless than half the states in the nation.\u201d Mot. 20. But this Court has\n\n        recognized that nationwide relief is appropriate where \u201cnecessary to provide\n\n        complete relief to the plaintiffs.\u201d CASA, Inc., 2025 WL 654902, at *1; Roe, 947\n\n        F.3d at 232. A TRO with nationwide effect is particularly appropriate here because\n\n        TROs must be clear and definite. See Kadel v. Folwell, 100 F.4th 122, 159 (4th Cir.\n\n        2024). A \u201cpiecemeal approach is not appropriate\u201d where it would undermine\n\n        plaintiffs\u2019 relief by \u201ccaus[ing] confusion.\u201d Association of Cmty. Cancer Centers v.\n\n        Azar, 509 F. Supp. 3d 482, 504 (D. Md. 2020). Here, the district court reasonably\n\n        concluded that state-by-state relief would be \u201cunworkable\u201d because it \u201cwould\n\n        functionally create two separate, drastically different regimes with respect to\n\n        probationary employees in each affected agency.\u201d (ECF 43, at 48). The Agencies\n\n        do not dispute this point, much less explain how it was an abuse of discretion.\n\n\n                                          CONCLUSION\n\n              The emergency motion for stay should be denied.\n\n\n\n                                                 23\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248    Doc: 16       Filed: 03/19/2025    Pg: 24 of 30\n\n\n\n\n                                            Respectfully submitted,\n\n         KEITH ELLISON                             ANTHONY G.

The States are prepared to file their opposition to the\n\nstay motion no later than Wednesday, March 19, at 5:00 p.m. (or any deadline set by\n\nthis Court, if a briefing schedule is issued).\n\n      Second, no urgent circumstances require an immediate administrative stay.\n\nHaving waited four days since the district court issued its TRO, the Agencies now\n\fseek to administratively stay the temporary order in its entirety. This request comes\n\nafter the district court\u2019s 1:00 p.m. deadline for the Agencies to reinstate all\n\nterminated probationary employees. (ECF 44 \u00b6 3.) Had the Agencies required\n\nimmediate relief, they could have requested it on Friday, over the weekend, or at any\n\npoint before the compliance deadline passed. They did not. Accordingly, there is\n\nno reason to enter a temporary administrative stay now.\n\n      Third, an administrative stay would disrupt rather than preserve the status quo,\n\nwhich is the \u201clast uncontested status between the parties which preceded the\n\ncontroversy.\u201d League of Women Voters of N.C. v. North Carolina, 769 F.3d 224,\n\n236 (4th Cir. 2014). Here, the district court\u2019s order maintains the status quo between\n\nthe parties by (1) temporarily restraining the Agencies from continuing their string\n\nof unlawful mass firings; and (2) temporarily reinstating the terminated probationary\n\nemployees. And at this point, the States have received word from declarants who\n\nsupplied statements to the district court that multiple employees in the affected\n\nagencies have been offered reinstatement. Indeed, the Agencies represented to the\n\ndistrict court that they have \u201cworked diligently . . . to comply with [the TRO]\n\nrequirements on the deadline established by this Court,\u201d and would continue doing\n\nso \u201cup to and including the 1pm compliance deadline\u201d of today, March 17, 2025.\n\n(ECF 49, at 1\u20132.) Thus, there is every indication on the ground that the Agencies\n\nboth can comply and are working to do so. Granting an administrative stay now\n\fwould only stall that progress and sow confusion. See American Fed\u2019n of Gov\u2019t\n\nEmps., AFL-CIO v. Office of Personnel Mgmt., No. 25-1677 (9th Cir. March 17,\n\n2025), ECF 14.1 (denying emergency motion for an administrative stay because \u201cit\n\nwould disrupt the status quo and turn it on its head\u201d).\n\n      Fourth, an administrative stay would be particularly inappropriate in the\n\ncontext of this appeal because TROs are generally not appealable\u2014and hence this\n\nCourt lacks jurisdiction over the underlying appeal. See Drudge v. McKernon, 482\n\nF.2d 1375, 1376 (4th Cir. 1973) (\u201c[W]e are aware of [no authority], that, as a general\n\nrule, the granting . . . of a motion for a temporary restraining order is an appealable\n\norder.\u201d); U.S. Dep\u2019t of Lab. v. Wolf Run Mining Co., 452 F.3d 275, 281 n.1 (4th Cir.\n\n2006) (explaining that TROs are of short duration, unlike injunctions); see also New\n\nYork v. Trump, No. 25-1138, 2025 WL 455494, at *1 (1st Cir. Feb. 11, 2025) (noting\n\nuncertainty about whether federal courts of appeals \u201chave jurisdiction to consider [a]\n\nrequest for an administrative stay arising out of a temporary restraining order\u201d).\n\nIndeed, the district court is working expeditiously to resolve this dispute, having set\n\na briefing schedule for the States\u2019 forthcoming preliminary injunction motion and\n\nscheduling a hearing on that motion for March 26. (ECF 44 \u00b6 7.) So even though\n\nthe TRO is not appealable, an appealable order will likely be issued soon.\n\n      Lastly, an administrative stay is unwarranted because the record evidence and\n\nlaw overwhelmingly support the district court\u2019s decision to issue a TRO, as the\n\fStates\u2019 forthcoming opposition to the Agencies\u2019 motion for a stay pending appeal\n\nwill explain in greater detail.\n\n                                  CONCLUSION\n\n        The Court should deny the Agencies\u2019 request for an immediate administrative\n\nstay.\n\n                                             Respectfully submitted,\n\n\n\n KEITH ELLISON                                ANTHONY G.

This\n\n        order is all the more extraordinary because it issued in a lawsuit brought by nineteen\n\n        states and the District of Columbia\u2014but not even one affected employee\u2014to redress\n\n        the purported violation of a notice requirement.\n\n               This Court should stay the district court\u2019s order and enter an immediate\n\n        administrative stay. The district court lacked jurisdiction to superintend the federal\n\n        government\u2019s employment relationships at the behest of states that are strangers to\n\n        those relationships. The states lack Article III standing to represent their citizens as\n\n        parens patriae against the federal government or to complain of downstream\n\n        economic effects caused by the government\u2019s employment actions, and the district\n\n        court\u2019s attempt to repackage plaintiffs\u2019 injuries as \u201cinformational\u201d is a dead end.\n\n        Moreover, Congress has channeled all federal employment disputes into an\n\n        administrative process with judicial review in the Federal Circuit. Allowing states to\n\n        circumvent that process would upend a reticulated statutory scheme and contravene\n\n        Supreme Court precedent recognizing that where an exclusive remedial scheme\n\n        permits claims by only a particular class of plaintiffs, it shuts the door to claims by\n\n        anyone else.\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248     Doc: 8         Filed: 03/17/2025    Pg: 4 of 171\n\n\n\n\n              The district court\u2019s merits analysis was no sounder. Under federal law, a\n\n        probationary employee may be terminated upon an agency\u2019s determination that the\n\n        employee has \u201cfail[ed] to demonstrate fully his or her qualifications for continued\n\n        employment.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.803(a). The district court believed that the government\n\n        had not identified sufficient cause for terminating any probationary employees\u2014itself\n\n        a remarkable conclusion to reach in litigation to which the employees are not\n\n        parties\u2014but it did not stop there. Instead, the district court concluded that since the\n\n        government did not have sufficient cause for firing these employees, it must have\n\n        actually conducted a reduction in force (RIF), a specific type of personnel procedure\n\n        that may require advance notice to states, see 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d). But even if the court\n\n        were correct that the government lacked sufficient cause to fire probationary\n\n        employees, that would not somehow mean the government had conducted RIFs\u2014it\n\n        would just mean that the probationary employees could challenge their terminations\n\n        through the mechanisms created by Congress.\n\n              The remaining stay factors overwhelmingly favor the government. The court\u2019s\n\n        order has caused and will continue to cause significant burdens for almost two dozen\n\n        agencies, representing an extraordinary incursion on the executive branch\u2019s authority\n\n        to manage its workforce. The states, by contrast, do not suffer any cognizable harm\n\n        (let alone irreparable harm) from the federal government\u2019s determination that it no\n\n        longer wishes to employ certain of their citizens. At an absolute minimum, the\n\n        district court\u2019s nationwide order\u2014premised on its conclusion that just one plaintiff\n                                                   2\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248      Doc: 8         Filed: 03/17/2025     Pg: 5 of 171\n\n\n\n\n        state has standing because it did not receive notice\u2014vastly exceeded what was\n\n        necessary to redress plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cparticular injury.\u201d Gill v. Whitford, 585 U.S. 48, 73\n\n        (2018).\n\n               To correct these errors and stem the chaos they will cause, this Court should\n\n        grant an immediate administrative stay and stay pending appeal.1\n\n                                             STATEMENT\n\n               A.

On January 20, 2025, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM)\n\n        transmitted a guidance memo to Executive Branch agencies identifying probationary\n\n        periods as \u201can essential tool for agencies to assess employee performance.\u201d\n\n        Memorandum from Charles Ezell, Acting Director, U.S. Office of Personnel\n\n        Management, to Heads and Acting Heads of Departments and Agencies, Guidance\n\n        on Probationary Periods, Administrative Leave and Details, at 1 (Jan. 20, 2025). The\n\n        memo directed agencies to \u201cidentify all employees on probationary periods\u201d and\n\n        \u201cpromptly determine whether those employees should be retained at the agency.\u201d Id.\n\n        On March 4, OPM issued revised guidance emphasizing that agencies \u201chave ultimate\n\n        decision-making authority over, and responsibility for, such personnel actions.\u201d\n                                                   5\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248      Doc: 8        Filed: 03/17/2025    Pg: 8 of 171\n\n\n\n\n        Memorandum from Charles Ezell, Acting Director, U.S. Office of Personnel\n\n        Management, to Heads and Acting Heads of Departments, Guidance on Probationary\n\n        Periods, Administrative Leave and Details, at 2 (rev. Mar. 4, 2025),\n\n        https://perma.cc/E8P5-74WZ.\n\n              Invoking their legal authorities to manage their workforces, certain federal\n\n        agencies have terminated certain probationary employees. According to the plaintiffs,\n\n        between February 13 and March 3, the government terminated \u201cat least 24,000\n\n        probationary employees.\u201d See Op. 7. The states allege that they \u201cwere not provided\n\n        any notice of such terminations.\u201d Id.\n\n              2.     Plaintiffs\u201419 states and the District of Columbia\u2014commenced this\n\n        action on March 6, 2025, and they sought a temporary restraining order the following\n\n        day. See Dkt. Nos. 1, 4. Plaintiffs sought an order \u201crestraining Defendants from\n\n        terminating federal probationary employees without making specific, individualized\n\n        determinations regarding the inadequacy of the employee\u2019s conduct or performance\u201d\n\n        and \u201c[c]ompelling Defendants to reinstate federal probationary employees fired on or\n\n        after January 20, 2025, as part of mass terminations that did not comply with RIF\n\n        procedures and were not based on individual determinations of conduct or\n\n        performance.\u201d Dkt. No. 4, at 2.\n\n              On March 13, following briefing and a hearing, the district court substantially\n\n        granted plaintiffs\u2019 motion. With respect to standing, the district court indicated that\n\n        \u201c[i]informational injury has long been recognized as a valid injury in fact,\u201d Op. 14, and\n                                                    6\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248      Doc: 8        Filed: 03/17/2025     Pg: 9 of 171\n\n\n\n\n        that the states had suffered such an injury by not being provided advance notice of\n\n        terminations. As a result, the court concluded, the states had \u201cincurred substantial\n\n        follow-on harms,\u201d including \u201cincreased burdens\u201d in providing resources to their\n\n        citizens in response to the terminations and in paying unemployment benefits. Id. at\n\n        14-15; see also id. at 15 (\u201cStates have had to divert money and human resources from\n\n        existing purposes to new ones\u201d and have \u201cdone so less efficiently than they would\n\n        otherwise have.\u201d). The court found that these injuries were caused by defendants\u2019\n\n        failure to provide notice, id. at 19-20, and were redressable because reinstatements\n\n        would relieve pressure on the states\u2019 unemployment programs, id. at 20-21. Because it\n\n        \u201cwould order nationwide relief even if just a single State had standing,\u201d the court\n\n        declined to determine which states other than Maryland had standing. See id. at 18 n.3.\n\n              The court rejected the government\u2019s contention that claims concerning\n\n        termination of federal employment may only be pursued under the CSRA and the\n\n        FSLMRS, reasoning that the statutory scheme \u201cforecloses any possibility of the States\n\n        bringing their claims before an administrative agency\u201d because only unions,\n\n        employees, and applicants for employment have rights under those statutes. Op. 26.\n\n              On the merits, the court found that the government\u2019s termination of\n\n        probationary employees constituted a RIF because the \u201cterminated probationary\n\n        employees were plainly not terminated for cause.\u201d Op. 33; see also, e.g., id. at 38 (\u201cThe\n\n        wholesale dismissal of employees due to their status as probationary employees\n\n        appears to be some form of reorganization, even if the Government does not refer to\n                                                    7\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248       Doc: 8        Filed: 03/17/2025    Pg: 10 of 171\n\n\n\n\n        it as such.\u201d).2 The district court then held that the government had failed to comply\n\n        with the requirements governing RIFs, including advance notice to states. See id. at\n\n        37-38.\n\n                 The court found that the remaining preliminary injunction factors were\n\n        satisfied. It acknowledged that any harms faced by the states were \u201clargely\n\n        economic,\u201d but it found that they were irreparable \u201cbecause money damages are likely\n\n        not available\u201d from the federal government. Op. 41. The court further concluded\n\n        that a \u201cdiversion of resources as a result of the lack of notice also constitutes an\n\n        irreparable harm.\u201d Id. at 42. The court found that the balance of the equities and the\n\n        public interest favored the states. Id. at 42-44.\n\n                 The court ordered that the government must reinstate \u201call Affected\n\n        Probationary Employees throughout the United States FORTHWITH, and in any\n\n        event before March 17, 2025, at 1:00 p.m. EDT.\u201d Dkt. No. 44, at 1.3 It further issued\n\n        a sweeping follow-the-law injunction directing that the government shall not \u201cconduct\n\n        any future \u2026 [RIFs]\u2014whether formally labeled as such or not\u2014except in compliance\n\n\n\n\n                 The district court found that plaintiffs were unlikely to succeed on their\n                 2\n\n        claims as to the Department of Defense, the National Archives and Records\n        Administration, and OPM, as the states failed to present sufficient evidence\n        concerning terminations at those agencies. See Op. 39. It therefore did not order\n        relief against those agencies. See Dkt. No. 44, at 3-4.\n                 The Order defines \u201c[r]einstatement\u201d as \u201crestoration to employment, whether\n                 3\n\n        actually on duty or on leave, including administrative leave.\u201d Dkt. No. 44, at 3.\n\n                                                     8\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248      Doc: 8        Filed: 03/17/2025     Pg: 11 of 171\n\n\n\n\n        with\u201d statutory and regulatory requirements. Id. at 1-2. The court ordered this relief\n\n        nationwide\u2014including in the 31 states that did not join this suit\u2014reasoning that\n\n        because the \u201cGovernment\u2019s policy is violative of the law across the board, it is\n\n        appropriate for injunctive relief to be nationwide in scope.\u201d Op. 48.4\n\n                                             ARGUMENT\n\n              A stay pending appeal turns on \u201c(1) whether the stay applicant \u2026 is likely to\n\n        succeed on the merits; (2) whether the applicant will be irreparably injured absent a\n\n        stay; (3) whether issuance of the stay will substantially injure the other parties \u2026 ; and\n\n        (4) where the public interest lies.\u201d Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 426 (2009) (quotation\n\n        marks omitted). These factors overwhelmingly favor a stay because the district\n\n        court\u2019s sweeping injunction is flawed on numerous levels and threatens chaos if not\n\n        stayed.\n\n\n\n\n              4\n                 On March 13, 2025, in a separate lawsuit brought by unions and nonprofits, a\n        district court granted a preliminary injunction ordering the Departments of Veterans\n        Affairs, Agriculture, Defense, Energy, Interior, and Treasury to \u201cimmediately\u201d \u201coffer\n        reinstatement to any and all probationary employees terminated on or about February\n        13th and 14th 2025,\u201d on the theory that OPM unlawfully ordered the terminations\n        without statutory authority. See American Fed\u2019n of Gov\u2019t Emps. v. OPM, No. 3:25-cv-\n        01780 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 13, 2025), Dkt. No. 115. The government appealed and\n        moved for an administrative stay and stay pending appeal. On March 17, a divided\n        Ninth Circuit panel denied the motion for an administrative stay and set expedited\n        briefing on the motion for a stay pending appeal.\n\n                                                    9\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248       Doc: 8         Filed: 03/17/2025      Pg: 12 of 171\n\n\n\n\n        I.     This Court Has Appellate Jurisdiction.\n\n               At the outset, this Court has appellate jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1).\n\n        While courts of appeals typically lack jurisdiction to review temporary restraining\n\n        orders, \u201cthe label attached to an order is not dispositive.\u201d Abbott v. Perez, 585 U.S.\n\n        579, 594 (2018). Thus, \u201cwhere an order has the \u2018practical effect\u2019 of granting or\n\n        denying an injunction, it should be treated as such for purposes of appellate\n\n        jurisdiction.\u201d Id.; see also, e.g., Sampson v. Murray, 415 U.S. 61, 86-87 (1974) (district\n\n        court cannot \u201cshield its orders from appellate review merely by designating them as\n\n        temporary restraining orders\u201d).\n\n               Courts have explained that it may be appropriate to treat a temporary\n\n        restraining order as a preliminary injunction when \u201can adversary hearing has been\n\n        held, and the court\u2019s basis for issuing the order strongly challenged.\u201d Sampson, 415\n\n        U.S. at 87; see also, e.g., Free State Realty Co. v. United States, No. 73-1475, 1973 WL\n\n        21479, at *1 (4th Cir. Dec. 19, 1973) (per curiam) (unpublished) (\u201cIn distinguishing\n\n        between a preliminary injunction and a temporary restraining order, we must consider\n\n        the subject matter of the order, its expected duration, and whether or not both parties\n\n        were heard prior to its issuance.\u201d). And an order that \u201cthreaten[s] serious and perhaps\n\n        irreparable harm if not immediately reviewed\u201d is likely an appealable injunction, even\n\n        if denominated in other terms. Abbott, 585 U.S. at 595.\n\n               Here, the court received briefing and heard argument from the parties at a\n\n        motions hearing, see Dkt. Nos. 4, 20, before issuing a 56-page opinion that delved\n                                                      10\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248       Doc: 8         Filed: 03/17/2025      Pg: 13 of 171\n\n\n\n\n        deeply into the merits. And although the court described its order as simply\n\n        preserving the status quo until March 27, Dkt. No. 44, at 2, it directed the federal\n\n        government to reinstate thousands of terminated employees, some of whom were\n\n        terminated weeks prior to its order. Indeed, the court itself recognized the \u201cpractical\n\n        reality that the relief [it ordered] will have far-reaching impacts on the federal\n\n        workforce and will require the Government to expend considerable resources.\u201d Op.\n\n        51. That is not limited, status quo relief; it is the ultimate relief plaintiffs seek in this\n\n        lawsuit. See Dkt. No. 1, at 50-51; see also Sampson, 415 U.S. at 74 (\u201cextensive relief\u201d of\n\n        the \u201cmandatory retention of [an employee] in the position from which she was\n\n        dismissed\u201d constitutes an injunction rather than a stay). And if the government is\n\n        obligated to continue paying employees who have been reinstated, it will have no\n\n        effective mechanism to recoup those funds (not least because the district court\n\n        required the states to each post only a nominal $100 bond, Op. 53). In these\n\n        circumstances, the district court\u2019s order is immediately appealable.\n\n        II.    The Government Is Likely To Prevail On The Merits\n\n               A.     The District Court Lacked Jurisdiction\n\n                      1.      Article III Standing\n\n               The district court went off-track from the start, because the states lack standing\n\n        to superintend the federal government\u2019s employment practices, even if those practices\n\n        cause downstream effects upon state budgets and operations. States cannot sue the\n\n        federal government on behalf of their citizens as parens patriae. See Haaland v.\n                                                      11\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248       Doc: 8         Filed: 03/17/2025     Pg: 14 of 171\n\n\n\n\n        Brackeen, 599 U.S. 255, 295 (2023). Instead, like any other litigant, a state must\n\n        demonstrate that it has suffered an injury-in-fact that is \u201cfairly traceable to the\n\n        challenged conduct of the defendant\u201d and \u201clikely to be redressed by a favorable\n\n        judicial decision.\u201d Spokeo, Inc. v. Robbins, 578 U.S. 330, 338 (2016). The states cannot\n\n        make that showing.\n\n               The states allege that they are injured because they will have to provide\n\n        resources to their citizens who were terminated. See, e.g., Dkt. No. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 169-207.\n\n        That theory is irreconcilable with United States v. Texas, 599 U.S. 670, 674 (2023)\u2014\n\n        binding, recent precedent that the district court failed to even acknowledge.\n\n               In Texas, states challenged a federal immigration policy that would \u201cimpose[]\n\n        costs on the States.\u201d 599 U.S. at 674. The states claimed the federal government\u2019s\n\n        immigration-enforcement decisions would force them to \u201csupply social services such\n\n        as healthcare and education\u201d to additional persons. Id. The Supreme Court held the\n\n        states lacked standing, explaining that \u201cfederal courts must remain mindful of bedrock\n\n        Article III constraints in cases brought by States against an executive agency or\n\n        officer.\u201d Id. at 680 n.3. \u201c[I]n our system of dual federal and state sovereignty, federal\n\n        policies frequently generate indirect effects on state revenues or state spending.\u201d Id.\n\n        And a theory of standing based on those indirect effects is \u201cmore attenuated\u201d and less\n\n        likely to succeed. Id.; accord, e.g., Arizona v. Biden, 40 F.4th 375, 386 (6th Cir. 2022)\n\n        (rejecting contention that any federal policy that \u201cimposes peripheral costs on a State\n\n        creates a cognizable Article III injury\u201d).\n                                                     12\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248      Doc: 8         Filed: 03/17/2025     Pg: 15 of 171\n\n\n\n\n               Similarly, here, the states assert that the federal government\u2019s employment\n\n        decisions have inflicted downstream harms. They allege, for example, that the\n\n        terminations have imposed burdens on state \u201cadministrative process[es] for handling\n\n        [unemployment insurance] claims,\u201d Dkt. No. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 171, 179; threatened increased\n\n        enrollment in social services such as Medicaid, e.g., id. \u00b6\u00b6 205-206; and caused the\n\n        states to expend funds to establish informational resources for their citizens, e.g., id.\n\n        \u00b6\u00b6 168, 202, 205. Such harms are not cognizable injuries-in-fact. See Texas, 599 U.S.\n\n        at 674, 680 n.3. Were the rule otherwise, states could claim standing to second-guess\n\n        nearly any federal personnel decision\u2014hirings, firings, relocations, etc.\u2014on the\n\n        theory that the decision has a downstream effect on state resources.\n\n               The district court\u2019s attempt to repackage the states\u2019 alleged injuries as\n\n        \u201cinformational,\u201d Op. 13, does not make them any more cognizable. The district court\n\n        reasoned that the states are, in effect, asserting \u201cjust one injury\u201d: an \u201cinformational\n\n        injury\u201d from the alleged lack of \u201clegally entitled\u201d notice that the federal government\n\n        was initiating a RIF. See Op. 13-15. But informational injury, standing alone, does\n\n        not create Article III standing. See TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 594 U.S. 413, 442\n\n        (2021). Instead, the asserted informational injury must cause \u201creal\u201d harms that \u201care of\n\n        the type that have traditionally been regarded as providing a basis for a lawsuit in\n\n        English or American courts.\u201d Dreher v. Experian Info. Sols., Inc., 856 F.3d 337, 345 (4th\n\n        Cir. 2017) (quotation marks omitted). Here, the only harms the district court\n\n        identified are the purported harms to state resources discussed above, which cannot\n                                                    13\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248      Doc: 8         Filed: 03/17/2025      Pg: 16 of 171\n\n\n\n\n        suffice. See, e.g., Op. 14-15 (citing \u201cincreased\u201d unemployment claims and need to\n\n        \u201cdivert money and human resources\u201d to provide services and benefit programs).\n\n               Nor would any such \u201cinformational\u201d injury support the extraordinary relief\n\n        ordered by the district court in any event. A plaintiff seeking injunctive relief on a\n\n        theory of informational injury must assert that a judicial order would lead him to\n\n        obtain information he lacks\u2014\u201c[a]s when an agency denies requests for information\n\n        under the Freedom of Information Act.\u201d Public Citizen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 491 U.S.\n\n        440, 449 (1989); see also, e.g., Federal Election Comm\u2019n v. Akins, 524 U.S. 11, 21 (1998).\n\n        Here, at least as to terminations that have already occurred, the states do not allege\n\n        that any information is presently being withheld from them. Any informational injury\n\n        no longer exists and could not possibly be grounds for the district court\u2019s sweeping\n\n        reinstatement order.\n\n                      2.     CSRA Channeling\n\n               Even if the states had Article III standing, the government would remain likely\n\n        to succeed on appeal because the district court lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate their\n\n        challenges to the employment decisions of federal agencies. Instead, Congress has\n\n        \u201cestablished a comprehensive system\u201d that provides the \u201cexclusive means\u201d for\n\n        reviewing such matters. Elgin v. Department of the Treasury, 567 U.S. 1, 5, 8 (2012)\n\n        (quotation marks omitted).\n\n               The CSRA, together with the FSLMRS, \u201ccreates an integrated scheme of\n\n        administrative and judicial review, wherein the Congress intentionally provided\u2014and\n                                                     14\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248        Doc: 8        Filed: 03/17/2025    Pg: 17 of 171\n\n\n\n\n        intentionally chose not to provide\u2014particular forums and procedures for particular\n\n        kinds of claims.\u201d American Fed\u2019n of Gov\u2019t Emps. v. Secretary of the Air Force, 716 F.3d 633,\n\n        636 (D.C. Cir. 2023) (alterations, citation, and quotations marks omitted). Congress\n\n        allowed certain individual federal employees who are affected by agency personnel\n\n        decisions to challenge those decisions \u201cby litigating their claims through the statutory\n\n        scheme in the context of [a] concrete\u201d dispute, albeit limited to the claims and\n\n        remedies provided by Congress. See Am. Fed\u2019n of Gov\u2019t Emps. v. Trump, 929 F.3d 748,\n\n        757 (D.C. Cir. 2019).\n\n                 The district court never disputed that if this lawsuit were brought by the real\n\n        parties in interest\u2014terminated probationary employees\u2014it could only proceed\n\n        through the scheme enacted by Congress. See, e.g., Op. 24 (\u201cCongress has provided\n\n        for the exclusive administrative review of most employment claims brought by federal\n\n        employees \u2026 .\u201d); see also, e.g., Fornaro v. James, 416 F.3d 63, 67 (D.C. Cir. 2005)\n\n        (Roberts, J.) (\u201c[W]hat you get under the CSRA is what you get.\u201d). Yet it concluded\n\n        that those statutory limitations are irrelevant because Congress failed to include states\n\n        among the parties who may bring claims under that scheme. See Op. 26, 30. That has\n\n        it backwards. \u201c[T]he CSRA is the exclusive avenue for suit even if the plaintiff cannot\n\n        prevail.\u201d Grosdidier v. Chairman, Broad. Bd. of Governors, 560 F.3d 495, 497 (D.C. Cir.\n\n        2009).\n\n                 Supreme Court precedent makes clear that when a comprehensive scheme\n\n        permits review at the behest of some types of plaintiffs but not others, it implicitly\n                                                     15\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248      Doc: 8        Filed: 03/17/2025     Pg: 18 of 171\n\n\n\n\n        precludes review by plaintiffs who are not authorized to bring claims. In Block v.\n\n        Community Nutrition Institute, 467 U.S. 340, 347 (1984), the Supreme Court considered a\n\n        statute that permitted dairy handlers to obtain review of certain \u201cmarket orders\u201d after\n\n        exhausting administrative remedies, but did not authorize review by anyone else. See\n\n        id. at 346 (citing 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 608c). When a group of dairy consumers sought review of\n\n        a marketing order, the Supreme Court explained that the statute omits a \u201cprovision\n\n        for participation by consumers in any proceeding,\u201d and that \u201c[i]n a complex scheme\n\n        of this type, the omission of such a provision is sufficient reason to believe that\n\n        Congress intended to foreclose consumer participation in the regulatory process.\u201d Id.\n\n        at 347. Accordingly, the Court explained, the \u201cstructure of this Act indicates that\n\n        Congress intended only producers and handlers, and not consumers, to ensure that\n\n        the statutory objectives would be realized.\u201d Id. And the \u201crestriction of the\n\n        administrative remedy to handlers strongly suggests that Congress intended a similar\n\n        restriction of judicial review of market orders.\u201d Id. Any other holding would facilitate\n\n        circumvention of the comprehensive statutory scheme. See id. at 348.\n\n              The principles described in Block apply with full force to the CSRA. See United\n\n        States v. Fausto, 484 U.S. 439, 448 (1988) (applying Block to conclude that certain\n\n        employees who lack CSRA appeal rights \u201cshould not be able to demand judicial\n\n        review for the type of personnel action covered by that chapter\u201d). Just as Congress\n\n        \u201cintentionally foreclosed judicial review to employees who \u2026 are subjected to\n\n        disciplinary actions which are modest in nature,\u201d Pinar v. Dole, 747 F.2d 899, 912 (4th\n                                                   16\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248        Doc: 8      Filed: 03/17/2025     Pg: 19 of 171\n\n\n\n\n        Cir. 1984), it intentionally foreclosed judicial review by parties other than those whom\n\n        it specifically authorized to seek relief. Any other result would encourage litigants to\n\n        \u201cbypass the statutory and administrative remedies in order to seek direct judicial relief\n\n        and thereby deprive the Government of the opportunity to work out its personnel\n\n        problems within the framework it has so painstakingly established.\u201d Id. at 913\n\n        (quotation marks omitted).\n\n              In short, Congress did not leave a gaping hole in the CSRA by permitting states\n\n        to challenge federal employees\u2019 terminations on their behalf. Indeed, such an\n\n        interpretation would be utterly at odds with Congress\u2019s intent in enacting the CSRA,\n\n        which was to replace a \u201cpatchwork system with an integrated scheme of\n\n        administrative and judicial review.\u201d Fausto, 484 U.S. at 445. Rather, Congress limited\n\n        review of federal employment actions to actions by affected employees themselves, in\n\n        a different forum.\n\n              B.     The Government Did Not Conduct A Reduction In Force\n                     Requiring Notice To States.\n\n              On the merits, the fundamental premise of the court\u2019s order\u2014that agencies\u2019\n\n        terminations of probationary employees amounted to an unannounced RIF\u2014is\n\n        wrong. Even if the district court were correct that the government had unlawfully\n\n        terminated certain probationary employees without sufficient cause, that would be a\n\n        claim that affected employees may pursue\u2014and in many cases are pursuing\u2014through\n\n        the procedures created by the CSRA. See Dkt. No. 20, at 8 (describing how some\n\n                                                   17\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248      Doc: 8        Filed: 03/17/2025     Pg: 20 of 171\n\n\n\n\n        probationers have pursued relief before the Office of Special Counsel and the MSPB).\n\n        It would not mean the government has accidentally conducted unlawful RIFs.\n\n               In stark contrast to a termination of a probationary employee, a RIF is a\n\n        mechanism that permits agencies to terminate employees \u201cbecause of lack of work;\n\n        shortage of funds; insufficient personnel ceiling; reorganization; the exercise of\n\n        reemployment rights or restoration rights; or reclassification of an employee\u2019s position\n\n        d[u]e to erosion of duties.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.201(a)(2). The district court believed that\n\n        \u201c[t]he wholesale dismissal of employees due to their status as probationary employees\n\n        appears to be some form of reorganization,\u201d Op. 38, but under the regulations a\n\n        reorganization is \u201cthe planned elimination, addition, or redistribution of functions or\n\n        duties in an organization,\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.203. The district court identified no record\n\n        evidence that any agency had engaged in a reorganization; it simply speculated that\n\n        because the terminations were unlawful, they must have actually been RIFs. The\n\n        government is highly likely to succeed in demonstrating that this speculation was\n\n        erroneous.\n\n        III.   The Equitable Factors Favor A Stay\n\n               The equitable factors all strongly favor a stay pending appeal. Every day that\n\n        the injunction is in effect causes irreparable injuries to the government and the public,\n\n        whose interests \u201cmerge\u201d here. Nken, 556 U.S. at 435. And even assuming that\n\n        plaintiffs established irreparable injury, any such injury is \u201cplainly outweigh[ed]\u201d by\n\n        the public interest and the Executive Branch\u2019s interest in the effective and efficient\n                                                    18\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248      Doc: 8         Filed: 03/17/2025      Pg: 21 of 171\n\n\n\n\n        management of the federal workforce. Winter v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S.\n\n        7, 26 (2008).\n\n               The harms to the government are apparent. Across the government, agencies\n\n        have determined that the continued employment of certain employees is unnecessary\n\n        and inconsistent with those agencies\u2019 missions. Beyond that, the district court\u2019s\n\n        exercise of jurisdiction has a \u201cdisruptive effect on the administrative processes\n\n        established by the government to handle cases such as these.\u201d Garcia v. United States,\n\n        680 F.2d 29, 32 (5th Cir. 1982); see supra pp.14-17.\n\n               Implementing the court\u2019s order also has been and will continue to be\n\n        extraordinarily burdensome for the affected agencies, current agency employees, and\n\n        the probationary employees themselves. At the outset, the injunction requires the\n\n        impacted agencies to contact thousands of terminated employees and reinstate their\n\n        employment\u2014itself a substantial administrative burden. The agencies have\n\n        endeavored to reinstate the terminated employees in compliance with the court\u2019s\n\n        order, but they still must complete necessary administrative tasks. These burdens\n\n        continue every day the order remains in effect and would be addressed by immediate\n\n        relief. The court\u2019s order also causes tremendous uncertainty for probationary\n\n        employees, who may accept reinstatement and go through the onboarding process\n\n        only to potentially lose their jobs again if the district court\u2019s order is reversed.\n\n               And, of course, it disserves both the government and the taxpayers to require\n\n        the government to continue employing individuals whose services the government has\n                                                     19\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248      Doc: 8         Filed: 03/17/2025     Pg: 22 of 171\n\n\n\n\n        determined it no longer requires. The government will not be able to recover that\n\n        money if it later wins this case. That harm, at least, could theoretically have been\n\n        addressed by a bond under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(c), but the district\n\n        court further abused its discretion by setting the amount of the bond at a nominal\n\n        $100 per plaintiff state\u2014which, on its face, is not \u201cproper\u201d to protect the interests of\n\n        the government.\n\n               On the other side of the ledger, the states have not established irreparable\n\n        injury warranting the district court\u2019s extraordinary relief. In the ordinary course,\n\n        federal employment disputes brought by proper plaintiffs\u2014employees\u2014rarely justify\n\n        preliminary relief because there are procedures by which a terminated employee may\n\n        obtain back pay from the federal government. See, e.g., Sampson, 415 U.S. at 92 & n.68.\n\n        And as discussed above, the states\u2019 allegations of downstream economic effects do\n\n        not establish an injury-in-fact, let alone irreparable harm. See supra pp 11-14.\n\n               At a minimum, there was no basis for the district court to enter nationwide\n\n        relief in a lawsuit brought by significantly less than half the states in the nation, only\n\n        one of which the district court concluded had standing. The legal infirmities of\n\n        nationwide injunctions are well-documented; they \u201ctake a toll on the federal court\n\n        system\u2014preventing legal questions from percolating through the federal courts,\n\n        encouraging forum shopping, and making every case a national emergency for the\n\n        courts and for the Executive Branch.\u201d Trump. v. Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. 2392, 2425 (2018)\n\n        (Thomas, J., concurring); see also, e.g., DHS v. New York, 140 S. Ct. 599, 600 (2020)\n                                                     20\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248      Doc: 8         Filed: 03/17/2025      Pg: 23 of 171\n\n\n\n\n        (Gorsuch, J., joined by Thomas, J., concurring). The district court\u2019s suggestion that\n\n        nationwide relief is warranted whenever government policy is \u201cviolative of the law\n\n        across the board,\u201d Op. 50, is a recipe for a nationwide injunction in every case given\n\n        that the federal government sets and enforces policy on a national basis. As current\n\n        circumstances well illustrate, that is not tenable.\n\n                                            CONCLUSION\n\n               The Court should stay the preliminary injunction pending appeal and enter an\n\n        immediate administrative stay pending consideration of this motion.\n\n                                                          Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                                          YAAKOV M.

President Trump and his Administration have made no secret of their contempt for the\n\n        roughly 2 million committed professionals who form the federal civil service. Nor have they\n\n        disguised their plans to terminate vast numbers of civil servants, starting with tens of thousands of\n\n        probationary employees. These large-scale, indiscriminate firings are not only subjecting the\n\n        Plaintiff States and communities across the country to chaos. They are also against the law.\n\n        2.     Federal statutes and regulations set forth procedures that federal agencies must follow\n\n        when conducting reductions in force (\u201cRIFs\u201d). Critically, these procedures require that federal\n\n        agencies provide 60 days of advance notice to affected employees and to states, so that they have\n\n        an opportunity to mitigate the harms of layoffs. Where an agency fails to provide such notice, the\n\n        employees \u201cmay not be released.\u201d\n\n        3.     Over the past month, the new Administration has run roughshod over the RIF requirements.\n\n        Specifically, as part of an effort to reduce the size of the federal workforce, the Office of Personnel\n\n        Management (\u201cOPM\u201d) has unlawfully directed federal agencies to conduct mass terminations of\n\n        probationary employees, suddenly and without any advance notice. Defendants have followed\n\n        through on this directive, firing employees by the hundreds and, in many instances, thousands\u2014\n\n        all without following the procedures for conducting RIFs and without providing notice to the\n\n        affected employees or states.\n\n        4.     This campaign has inflicted immense harms on tens of thousands of probationary\n\n        employees and their families. It has rendered them jobless without providing any advance notice\n\n\n\n                                                          8\n                                                      ADD.68\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248    Doc: 8     Filed: 03/17/2025 Pg: 96 of 171\n              Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA Document 1 Filed 03/06/25 Page 9 of 55\n\n\n\n        that might have given them an opportunity to seek other employment or even budget to prepare\n\n        for the loss of income. As a result, many affected employees and their families are struggling to\n\n        make ends meet\u2014to pay rent, buy groceries, and care for their loved ones.\n\n        5.     This campaign is harming Plaintiff States, too. In addition to the informational and\n\n        procedural injuries resulting from the deprivation of notice to which they were entitled, the lack of\n\n        notice has impeded the ability of many Plaintiff States to support affected employees and thereby\n\n        mitigate the financial and other impacts on state services. In fact, pursuant to federal statutory\n\n        requirements, Plaintiff States operate rapid response teams that provide immediate services and\n\n        resources to workers subject to mass layoffs. These services include job placement and job training\n\n        services as well as connections to social services like unemployment insurance and health\n\n        insurance. Because of Defendants\u2019 failure to adhere to the RIF notice procedures, many Plaintiff\n\n        States have had to scramble and expend additional resources to identify even which agencies have\n\n        conducted layoffs and which affected employees require support.\n\n        6.     Because of the lack of notice, many Plaintiff States have also faced increased\n\n        administrative demands related to adjudicating unemployment claims; decreased tax revenues; and\n\n        increased demands for social services. Some Plaintiff States have also lost the benefit of services\n\n        provided by federal employees embedded within state agencies, without any time to prepare.\n\n        7.     To address these harms to Plaintiff States, this action seeks declaratory and injunctive relief\n\n        requiring Defendants: to cease the RIFs of probationary employees that they have conducted\n\n        unlawfully and without notice; to reinstate any probationary employees who were terminated as\n\n        part of mass terminations on or after January 20, 2025; to refrain from separating any employees\n\n        pursuant to a RIF prior to reinstatement of the unlawfully terminated probationary employees; and\n\n\n\n\n                                                         9\n                                                     ADD.69\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 8     Filed: 03/17/2025 Pg: 97 of 171\n             Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA Document 1 Filed 03/06/25 Page 10 of 55\n\n\n\n        to conduct any future RIFs in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, including providing\n\n        required notices to Plaintiff States.\n\n                                      I.

The probationary period provides the opportunity for the federal agency to assess the\n\n        individual performance of the employee. Under governing OPM regulations, an agency \u201cshall\n\n        utilize the probationary period as fully as possible to determine the fitness of the employee and\n\n\n\n\n                                                         19\n                                                     ADD.79\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 8     Filed: 03/17/2025 Pg: 107 of 171\n             Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA Document 1 Filed 03/06/25 Page 20 of 55\n\n\n\n        shall terminate his or her services during this period if the employee fails to demonstrate fully his\n\n        or her qualifications for continued employment.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.803(a).\n\n        79.    Most employees in the excepted service are also subject to a statutory trial period of two\n\n        years, which, like the probationary period in the competitive service, is intended to permit the\n\n        agency to evaluate the employee\u2019s performance and fitness for long-term employment. 5 U.S.C.\n\n        \u00a7 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii).\n\n        80.    Outside of the context of a RIF, federal agencies may lawfully terminate probationary\n\n        employees for one of two reasons.\n\n        81.    First, a federal agency may lawfully terminate a probationary employee for reasons based\n\n        on conditions arising before the employee\u2019s probationary appointment. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.805.\n\n        82.    Second, a federal agency may lawfully terminate a probationary employee based on the\n\n        agency\u2019s assessment of the employee\u2019s performance during the probationary period, pursuant to 5\n\n        C.F.R. \u00a7 315.804(a), which is entitled: \u201cTermination of probationers for unsatisfactory\n\n        performance or conduct.\u201d\n\n        83.    Under that regulation, \u201cwhen an agency decides to terminate an employee serving a\n\n        probationary or trial period because his work performance or conduct during this period fails to\n\n        demonstrate his fitness or his qualifications for continued employment, it shall terminate his\n\n        services by notifying him in writing as to why he is being separated and the effective date of the\n\n        action.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.804(a). \u201cThe information in the notice as to why the employee is being\n\n        terminated shall, as a minimum, consist of the agency\u2019s conclusions as to the inadequacies of his\n\n        performance or conduct.\u201d Id. Trial-period employees in the excepted service have the same notice\n\n        rights when removed from their positions for performance reasons. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 316.304.\n\n\n\n\n                                                         20\n                                                     ADD.80\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 8     Filed: 03/17/2025 Pg: 108 of 171\n             Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA Document 1 Filed 03/06/25 Page 21 of 55\n\n\n\n        B.     RIF Requirements\n\n        84.    Apart from terminations of probationary employees for conditions arising before their\n\n        appointments or for unsatisfactory performance or conduct, federal agencies may only terminate\n\n        probationary employees as part of an agency RIF.\n\n        85.    A reduction-in-force \u201cis an administrative procedure by which agencies eliminate jobs and\n\n        reassign or separate employees who occupied the abolished positions. A RIF is not an adverse\n\n        action against a particular employee, but is directed solely at a position within an agency.\u201d James\n\n        v. Von Zemenszky, 284 F.3d 1310, 1314 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (citation omitted); Schall v. U.S. Postal\n\n        Serv., 73 F.3d 341, 344 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (similar).\n\n        86.    An agency must follow specific statutory directives in conducting a RIF, including\n\n        following the retention preferences in the statute, giving preference to the retention of military\n\n        veterans, and considering the employee\u2019s tenure and length of service. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(a)(1), (3).\n\n        87.    Congress delegated to OPM the authority to promulgate regulations that agencies must\n\n        follow in implementing RIFs. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(a).\n\n        88.    Pursuant to that statutory authorization, and through notice-and-comment rulemaking,\n\n        OPM has issued detailed regulations setting forth the procedures by which agencies must conduct\n\n        RIFs. See 5 C.F.R. Part 351.\n\n        89.    All agencies of the federal government are required to comply with the RIF regulations\n\n        whenever they \u201cdetermine[] that a reduction [in] force is necessary.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.204.\n\n        90.    The RIF regulations apply to employees in the competitive and excepted services. 5 C.F.R.\n\n        \u00a7 351.202(a), (b).\n\n        91.    Probationary employees are expressly covered by the RIF regulations. 5 C.F.R.\n\n        \u00a7\u00a7 351.501(b)(2), 351.502(b)(2). Probationary employees are included in \u201cgroup II\u201d of three\n\n        groups of employees, and may only be released, in order of retention, after the release of\n\n\n                                                        21\n                                                    ADD.81\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 8     Filed: 03/17/2025 Pg: 109 of 171\n             Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA Document 1 Filed 03/06/25 Page 22 of 55\n\n\n\n        \u201cgroup III\u201d employees, a group that includes employees under various temporary, term, and other\n\n        provisional appointments. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.501(b).\n\n        92.    Under these required RIF procedures, before conducting a RIF a federal agency must:\n\n        establish \u201ccompetitive areas in which employees compete for retention\u201d; designate the\n\n        \u201ccompetitive areas\u201d of which employees are to compete for retention at least 90 days before the\n\n        effective date of the RIF; designate any \u201ccompetitive levels\u201d of positions included in the RIFs that\n\n        would permit the agency to reassign retained employees without causing undue interruption; and\n\n        rank employees for retention based on factors including their tenure group, time in service\n\n        (including military service), veteran preference, length of service, and performance. See 5 U.S.C.\n\n        \u00a7 3502(a); 5 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 351.402-351.404, 351.504.\n\n        C.     RIF Notice Requirements\n\n        93.    Under the federal RIF statute and associated regulations, federal agencies are required to\n\n        provide at least 60 days of prior written notice before they may release any federal civil service\n\n        employee under a RIF. The agency must provide the written notice to (a) the employee, (b) the\n\n        employee\u2019s collective bargaining representative, and (c) the state or District where an affected\n\n        employee\u2019s duty station was located if the RIF would involve at least 50 employees within the\n\n        competitive area, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d); 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.803(b).\n\n        94.    The notice to the state must be provided to the state or agency designated by the state to\n\n        perform rapid response activities under the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, now called the\n\n        Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act of 2014 (\u201cWIOA Agency\u201d), and must also be provided\n\n        to \u201c[t]he chief elected official of local government(s) within which these separations will occur.\u201d\n\n        5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.803(b); see 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d)(3)(A). The purpose of states\u2019 \u201crapid response\u201d\n\n        activities is to quickly make public and private resources available to workers who are laid off, to\n\n        minimize the disruption to the affected workers and their communities. To help the state or locality\n\n\n                                                        22\n                                                     ADD.82\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 8     Filed: 03/17/2025 Pg: 110 of 171\n             Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA Document 1 Filed 03/06/25 Page 23 of 55\n\n\n\n        prepare for the disruptions associated with job losses, notices must include: (a) the number of\n\n        employees to be separated from service due to the reduction in force, broken down by geographic\n\n        area and organizational unit, (b) when those separations will occur; and (c) other information that\n\n        may facilitate the delivery of services to the affected workers. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d); 5 C.F.R.\n\n        \u00a7 351.803(c).\n\n        95.    The notice to an affected employee must include: (a) information concerning the right to\n\n        reemployment consideration and career transition assistance; (b) a release to authorize the federal\n\n        government to share his or her resume and employment information with the WIOA Agency and\n\n        potential public or private sector employers; and (c) information about how to apply for\n\n        unemployment insurance and access other benefits. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.803(a).\n\n        96.    Where circumstances \u201cnot reasonably foreseeable\u201d preclude giving 60 days\u2019 written notice,\n\n        the agency may request that OPM shorten the notice period; however, \u201c[n]o notice period may be\n\n        shortened to less than 30 days.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(e).\n\n        97.    Where an agency fails to provide any of these statutorily required notices, an employee\n\n        \u201cmay not be released, due to a reduction in force.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d).\n\n                                     IV.     FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS\n\n        98.    Since President Trump took office on January 20, 2025, Defendant Agencies have, at\n\n        OPM\u2019s direction, terminated tens of thousands of probationary employees.\n\n        99.    The mass terminations of probationary employees since January 20 were not driven by\n\n        agency determinations related to the performance or qualifications of any particular probationary\n\n        employee. Rather, these layoffs have all been part of a coordinated effort directed by the White\n\n        House and OPM to reduce the size of the federal workforce.\n\n\n\n\n                                                        23\n                                                    ADD.83\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 8     Filed: 03/17/2025 Pg: 111 of 171\n             Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA Document 1 Filed 03/06/25 Page 24 of 55\n\n\n\n        100.    Because the mass terminations of probationary employees are part of an effort to\n\n        restructure and reduce the workforces at Defendant Agencies, they constitute RIFs. See 5 U.S.C.\n\n        \u00a7 3502; 5 C.F.R. Part 351.\n\n        101.    In terminating probationary employees en masse, Defendants have not abided by the\n\n        statutory and regulatory requirements for RIFs, including the requirement to provide 60 days\u2019\n\n        notice to the Plaintiff States. This has inflicted and will continue to inflict serious and irreparable\n\n        harms on the Plaintiff States, as they must now deal with a sudden surge in unemployment, without\n\n        the advance notice required under the federal RIF statute and regulations.\n\n        A.      Defendants Have Conducted Unlawful RIFs Throughout the Federal Government.\n\n        102.    On January 20, 2025, the day President Trump took office, President Trump appointed\n\n        Charles Ezell to serve as Acting OPM Director.\n\n        103.    The same day, Acting OPM Director Ezell distributed a memo to \u201cHeads and Acting Heads\n\n        of Departments and Agencies\u201d regarding \u201cGuidance on Probationary Periods, Administrative\n\n        Leave and Details.\u201d In the memo, OPM directed agency heads to \u201cidentify all employees on\n\n        probationary periods . . . and send a report to OPM listing all such employees\u201d no later than January\n\n        24, 2025. OPM further directed agencies to \u201cpromptly determine whether those employees should\n\n        be retained by the agency.\u201d1\n\n        104.    Also on January 20, 2025, President Trump signed an executive order entitled \u201cHiring\n\n        Freeze.\u201d2 In addition to ordering \u201ca freeze on the hiring of federal civilian employees\u201d throughout\n\n        the executive branch, he directed the Director of the Office of Management and Budget\u2014in\n\n        consultation with OPM and the United States Department of Government Efficiency Service\n\n\n\n        1\n          https://chcoc.gov/sites/default/files/Guidance%20on%20Probationary%20Periods%2C%20Administrative%20Leav\n        e%20and%20Details%XXX-XX-XXXX%20FINAL.pdf\n        2\n          https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/hiring-freeze/\n\n\n                                                           24\n                                                       ADD.84\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 8     Filed: 03/17/2025 Pg: 112 of 171\n             Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA Document 1 Filed 03/06/25 Page 25 of 55\n\n\n\n        (\u201cDOGE\u201d)\u2014to \u201csubmit a plan to reduce the size of the Federal Government\u2019s workforce through\n\n        efficiency improvements and attrition.\u201d\n\n        105.     On February 11, 2025, President Trump issued Executive Order 14210, entitled\n\n        \u201cImplementing the President\u2019s \u2018Department of Government Efficiency\u2019 Workforce Optimization\n\n        Initiative.\u201d The Executive Order directed agency heads to \u201cpromptly undertake preparations to\n\n        initiate large-scale reductions in force (RIFs), consistent with applicable law, and to separate from\n\n        Federal service temporary employees and reemployed annuitants working in areas that will likely\n\n        be subject to the RIFs.\u201d3\n\n        106.    Rather than wait for agency heads to develop RIF plans and follow applicable procedures,\n\n        however, Defendants began mass unlawful terminations of their probationary employees.\n\n        107.    On or around February 11, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau terminated\n\n        approximately 73 probationary employees. 4 The agency terminated 70-100 additional\n\n        probationary employees on February 13. 5\n\n        108.    On or around February 12, the Department of Education terminated 60 probationary\n\n        employees.6\n\n        109.    On or around February 12, the General Services Administration notified approximately\n\n        100 probationary employees that they would be terminated.7 Upon information and belief, these\n\n        terminations will become effective on March 7.\n\n\n\n\n        3\n          https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/implementing-the-presidents-department-of-\n        government-efficiency-workforce-optimization-initiative/\n        4\n          https://www.npr.org/2025/02/12/nx-s1-5294479/cfpb-workers-fired-trump-doge\n        5\n          https://www.npr.org/2025/02/14/nx-s1-5298144/federal-layoffs-usda-hud-defense-trump\n        6\n          https://www.npr.org/2025/02/13/nx-s1-5296928/layoffs-trump-doge-education-energy\n        7\n          https://www.reuters.com/world/us/mass-firings-federal-workers-begin-trump-musk-purge-us-government-2025-\n        02-13/\n\n\n                                                             25\n                                                         ADD.85\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 8     Filed: 03/17/2025 Pg: 113 of 171\n             Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA Document 1 Filed 03/06/25 Page 26 of 55\n\n\n\n        110.    On February 13, OPM officials met with agency officials throughout the federal\n\n        government and ordered agencies to lay off nearly all of the federal government\u2019s approximately\n\n        220,0000 probationary employees.8\n\n        111.    On February 14, OPM sent an email to all agency Chief Human Capital Officers (CHCOs)\n\n        and their deputies to \u201cclarif[y] immediate next steps for probationary employees.\u201d\n\n        112.    In its February 14 email, OPM explained its directive to agencies:\n\n                We have asked that you separate probationary employees that you have not\n                identified as mission critical no later than the end of the day Monday, 2/27. We\n                have attached a template letter. The separation date should be as soon as possible\n                that is consistent with applicable agency policies (including those in CBAs).\n\n        113.    OPM\u2019s February 14 email reiterated that OPM\u2019s directive should be followed in light of\n\n        the \u201cPresident\u2019s directive to dramatically reduce the size of the federal workforce.\u201d\n\n        114.

On or around February 20, the National Archives and Records Administration terminated\n\n        over 60 probationary employees.25\n\n        132.    Upon information and belief, on or around February 20, the Department of Labor notified\n\n        more than 50 probationary employees that they will be terminated. Upon information and belief,\n\n        the effective date of termination will be March 7.\n\n        133.    On February 21, the Department of Defense announced that it was planning to terminate\n\n        5,400 probationary workers starting the week of February 24. 26 Upon information and belief, those\n\n        terminations have not begun, but they may begin at any moment.\n\n        134.

On or around March 3, the Department of Commerce fired 73 probationary employees at\n\n        the National Institute for Standards and Technology.29\n\n        138.    Upon information and belief, Defendants have already terminated tens of thousands of\n\n        probationary employees.\n\n        139.    Defendants have not published official counts and locations of the employees they have\n\n        terminated, but based on publicly reported numbers and firsthand accounts from affected\n\n        employees, it appears that Defendants have terminated at least 24,000 probationary employees as\n\n        of the date of this Complaint. Because Plaintiff States have not received notice of these mass\n\n        terminations, this accounting is necessarily incomplete and may be far higher.\n\n        140.    Thousands of additional terminations are expected any day. To continue to reduce the size\n\n        of the federal workforce, agencies that have not yet terminated most of their probationary\n\n        employees may do so at any moment.\n\n        B.      Defendants Have Not Followed Required RIF Procedures for the Mass Layoffs of\n                Probationary Employees\n\n        141.    Although the mass terminations of probationary employees have constituted RIFs,\n\n        Defendants have failed to follow the RIF procedures required by statute and regulation.\n\n        142.    For example, Defendants did not designate the \u201ccompetitive areas\u201d in which employees\n\n        would compete for retention, which they must do at least 90 days before the effective date of any\n\n        RIF. See 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.402.\n\n        143.    Defendants did not designate any \u201ccompetitive levels\u201d of positions included in the RIFs\n\n        that would permit the agency to reassign retained employees without causing undue interruption.\n\n        See 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.403.\n\n\n\n        29\n          https://www.govexec.com/workforce/2025/03/some-agencies-are-still-firing-probationers-while-others-have-\n        recalled-theirs-following-court-ruling/403407/?oref=ge-skybox-post\n\n\n                                                              30\n                                                         ADD.90\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 8     Filed: 03/17/2025 Pg: 118 of 171\n             Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA Document 1 Filed 03/06/25 Page 31 of 55\n\n\n\n        144.   Defendants did not establish a retention register of employees in each competitive level of\n\n        positions included in the RIFs. See 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.404.\n\n        145.   Defendants did not then rank employees for retention based on their tenure group, time in\n\n        service (including military service), veteran preference, length of service, and performance. See 5\n\n        U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(a); 5 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 351.501-351.504.\n\n        146.   Defendants did not provide required notices 60 days in advance of the effective date of\n\n        termination to affected employees, their collective bargaining representatives, or to Plaintiff States.\n\n        See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d); 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.803.\n\n        147.   Especially relevant to Plaintiff States, Defendants did not provide affected employees with\n\n        the required releases to authorize the release of their resumes and other relevant employment\n\n        information to the relevant WIOA Agency, for employment referrals to potential public and private\n\n        sector employers. See 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.803(a).\n\n        148.   Likewise, Defendants did not provide Plaintiff States and the relevant WIOA Agencies\n\n        with any prior notice, much less the 60-day notice required by law, which would have alerted\n\n        Plaintiff States to the number of employees to be separated from the agencies, broken down by\n\n        geographic area, and provided the effective date of the planned separations as well as other\n\n        information that could have facilitated the delivery of rapid response services. See 5 U.S.C.\n\n        \u00a7 3502(d); 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.803(b)-(c).\n\n        149.   Rather than comply with their legal obligations, Defendants summarily terminated\n\n        probationary employees en masse, providing termination notices to the affected employees by\n\n        form letters and emails, which frequently included errors and in many instances failed to include\n\n        even the employee\u2019s name or job title.\n\n\n\n\n                                                          31\n                                                      ADD.91\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 8     Filed: 03/17/2025 Pg: 119 of 171\n             Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA Document 1 Filed 03/06/25 Page 32 of 55\n\n\n\n        150.   These form termination notices, issued near-simultaneously to thousands of federal\n\n        probationary employees, failed to include any particularized agency determinations related to the\n\n        performance or qualifications of each affected probationary employee to justify their termination.\n\n        The notices were pretextual because Defendants were actually engaged in RIFs designed to reduce\n\n        the size of the federal workforce.\n\n        151.   For example, agency management at the National Science Foundation informed\n\n        probationary employees that the NSF had previously chosen to retain its probationary employees\n\n        but that OPM had directed NSF to terminate the employees. The managers said that terminating\n\n        the probationary employees was not a decision the agency made,\u201d but was \u201ca direction [it had]\n\n        received\u201d from OPM and that NSF leadership had \u201cno choice\u201d but to \u201cfollow[] orders.\u201d\n\n        152.   Likewise, in response to OPM\u2019s directive to terminate probationary employees en masse,\n\n        the Department of Treasury directed the Internal Revenue Service to terminate all probationary\n\n        employees \u201cbased on performance.\u201d Without conducting any review of probationary employees\u2019\n\n        qualifications or performance, the Department of Treasury directed the IRS to terminate\n\n        approximately 6,700 probationary employees. These terminations were unrelated to the\n\n        probationary employees\u2019 qualifications, performance, or conduct, but were in fact a RIF aimed at\n\n        reducing the size of the agency\u2019s workforce.\n\n        153.   The same pattern occurred at the Center for Consumer Information and Insurance\n\n        Oversight (CCIIO), a subset of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) within the\n\n        Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). CCIIO had determined that none of its\n\n        probationary employees should be removed from service because all were well qualified for their\n\n        positions and were performing well. Nevertheless, on February 13, 2025, HHS directed CCIIO to\n\n        terminate all of its probationary employees and to issue form termination letters that stated falsely\n\n\n\n\n                                                         32\n                                                     ADD.92\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 8     Filed: 03/17/2025 Pg: 120 of 171\n             Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA Document 1 Filed 03/06/25 Page 33 of 55\n\n\n\n        that the affected employees were being terminated \u201cbecause [their] ability, knowledge, and skills\n\n        do not fit the Agency\u2019s current needs, and [their] performance has not been adequate to justify\n\n        further employment.\u201d The CCIIO terminated 82 probationary employees on February 15, 2025,\n\n        representing approximately 15% of its workforce of approximately 600.\n\n        154.    Defendants\u2019 failure to provide required RIF notices rendered any terminations ineffective\n\n        and unlawful because an employee \u201cmay not be released, due to a reduction in force\u201d unless an\n\n        agency provides all statutorily required notices. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d).\n\n        155.    As explained in further detail below in Section IV.C, Defendants\u2019 failure to provide these\n\n        required notices has harmed Plaintiff States in several ways, including by hindering the ability to\n\n        provide rapid response services.\n\n        C.      Plaintiffs Are Harmed As a Direct Result of Defendants\u2019 Failure to Follow RIF\n                Requirements and Provide Advance Notice to the States.\n\n        156.    Plaintiff States have suffered and will imminently suffer several types of irreparable injury\n\n        due to the federal government\u2019s failure to provide notice of the RIFs.\n\n        157.    As noted above, when a federal agency plans to release 50 or more employees in a RIF,\n\n        the agency must provide 60 days\u2019 notice to the affected States\u2019 WIOA Agencies as well as the\n\n        chief elected officials for affected local jurisdictions.\n\n        158.    Plaintiff States have not received notice of a federal reduction in force from any federal\n\n        agency.\n\n        159.    In enacting the RIF notice requirements, Congress recognized the harms inherent to\n\n        sudden, unexpected mass layoffs, including that economic dislocation of workers can easily create\n\n        a cascade of instability throughout a regional economy. And it sought to provide the states with\n\n        some protection against those harms by requiring that agencies provide them with advance notice.\n\n\n\n\n                                                           33\n                                                       ADD.93\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 8     Filed: 03/17/2025 Pg: 121 of 171\n             Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA Document 1 Filed 03/06/25 Page 34 of 55\n\n\n\n        160.    Defendants\u2019 failure to provide notice has inflicted other harms as well. As a result of the\n\n        lack of notice, Plaintiff States are unable to proactively reach affected individuals and provide\n\n        services that would mitigate the harm the employees and their communities suffer as a result of\n\n        the sudden job loss.\n\n        161.    Plaintiff States also suffer procedural injury resulting in additional expenditures and harms\n\n        to public finances that they would not have to bear if notice had been provided.\n\n                                          Rapid Response Expenditures\n\n        162.    The Federal Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act of 2014, 29 U.S.C.\n\n        \u00a7 3174(A)(2)(i), requires that each state have a rapid response program to conduct outreach to\n\n        workers affected by a mass layoff and to provide the workers with support services, including job\n\n        transition services.\n\n        163.    The notice required by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d)(3)(A) is intended to trigger rapid response\n\n        activities since it is explicitly to be given to the state entity required to carry out rapid response\n\n        activities.\n\n        164.    The purpose of the rapid response system is to reduce individuals\u2019 reliance on public\n\n        benefit systems, such as unemployment insurance; to promote economic recovery and vitality by\n\n        developing an ongoing, comprehensive approach to identify, plan for, and respond to layoffs and\n\n        dislocations; and to prevent or minimize the impact of mass layoffs on workers, businesses, and\n\n        communities.\n\n        165.    When notified of a forthcoming mass layoff, a state\u2019s rapid response team is required to:\n\n        contact the employer, representatives of the affected workers, and the local community; assess the\n\n        layoff plans and schedule; and provide information and support to affected employees, including\n\n\n\n\n                                                         34\n                                                     ADD.94\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 8     Filed: 03/17/2025 Pg: 122 of 171\n             Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA Document 1 Filed 03/06/25 Page 35 of 55\n\n\n\n        information about filing for unemployment compensation and career services. 20 CFR \u00a7\u00a7\n\n        682.300, 682.330.\n\n        166.   The rapid response teams also facilitate connections to partner agencies and organizations\n\n        that can provide terminated workers and their families with critical services, such as home heating\n\n        assistance, legal aid, and financial advice.\n\n        167.   Because Plaintiff States\u2019 rapid response teams have received no notice of federal RIFs,\n\n        certain teams have been required to dedicate significantly more staff, resources, and expenditures\n\n        to fulfill their statutory mission. In particular, they have had to devote significant time and\n\n        resources simply to try to identify workers subject to federal mass layoffs and to otherwise make\n\n        resources available to potentially affected individuals in new ways, all because federal agencies\n\n        have failed to provide the legally required notice of mass layoffs.\n\n        168.   As one example of these efforts, some state agencies handling unemployment claims have\n\n        created new websites, requiring significant time and expense. See Maryland Workers Impacted by\n\n        Recent Federal Actions, https://response.maryland.gov/federalpublicservants/. These efforts were\n\n        a further attempt to provide rapid response resources and services, which could normally be\n\n        targeted at specific personnel before they are laid off, but must now be provided less efficiently\n\n        and at greater expense to the entire public, because the states\u2019 personnel remain unaware of who\n\n        has been laid off and whether and when the next federal mass layoff event will occur.\n\n        169.   As another example, because Maryland\u2019s Department of Labor did not receive advance\n\n        notice, staff have conducted extensive affirmative outreach to dozens of federal agencies and\n\n        offices to try and determine the location and extent of upcoming layoffs. Despite these efforts,\n\n        staff have not received any substantive responses. The Department has also had to divert\n\n        significant additional time of other agency personnel from state projects to instead respond to\n\n\n\n\n                                                         35\n                                                       ADD.95\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 8     Filed: 03/17/2025 Pg: 123 of 171\n             Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA Document 1 Filed 03/06/25 Page 36 of 55\n\n\n\n        federal mass firings, to try and identify recently terminated employees and provide relevant\n\n        resources and services.\n\n                                     Unemployment Benefits Expenditures\n\n        170.   As a general matter, the federal government is required to reimburse states for\n\n        unemployment benefits provided to former federal employees. Specifically, Plaintiff States are\n\n        party to an agreement with the United States Secretary of Labor, wherein the Secretary shall pay,\n\n        as an agent of the United States, Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees (\u201cUCFE\u201d)\n\n        pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8502(a).\n\n        171.   Each Plaintiff State has its own procedures for handling Unemployment Insurance (\u201cUI\u201d)\n\n        claims. Regardless, sudden mass layoffs burden the administrative process for handling UI claims,\n\n        and the lack of notice and chaotic nature of Defendants\u2019 mass layoffs of probationary employees\n\n        has already exacerbated or likely will exacerbate the strain on the Plaintiff States\u2019 systems for\n\n        administering UI.\n\n        172.   Maryland\u2019s experience exemplifies the problems with the unlawful way the Defendants\n\n        have conducted RIFs of probationary employees.\n\n        173.   The Maryland Department of Labor manages claims for unemployment benefits by\n\n        individuals formerly employed to work in Maryland.\n\n        174.   Pursuant to Md. Code Ann., Lab. & Empl. \u00a7 8-805(a), an individual in Maryland who\n\n        wishes to collect unemployment insurance benefits must file a claim in accordance with\n\n        regulations adopted by the Maryland Secretary of Labor. Claimants file claims online using the\n\n        Department\u2019s system to assert a claim initially and to provide information to indicate the basis of\n\n        the claim, the name of the claimant\u2019s previous employer, the reason for her separation, work\n\n        experience, and other relevant information. COMAR 09.32.02.05.\n\n\n\n\n                                                        36\n                                                    ADD.96\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 8     Filed: 03/17/2025 Pg: 124 of 171\n             Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA Document 1 Filed 03/06/25 Page 37 of 55\n\n\n\n        175.   The reason for termination alleged by the claimant is then transmitted to the claimant\u2019s\n\n        employer(s) for verification. The employer is then asked to furnish a report of the separation from\n\n        employment containing, among other information, the reason for the employee\u2019s separation and a\n\n        report of wage history. Md. Code Ann. Lab. & Empl. \u00a7 8-627; see also COMAR 09.32.02.05.\n\n        176.   Maryland law disqualifies some claimants from benefits depending on the circumstances\n\n        of their separation from employment. See Md. Code Ann. Lab. & Empl. \u00a7 8-1001, et seq.\n\n        Disqualifying circumstances include, among other reasons, termination for misconduct,\n\n        aggravated misconduct, and gross misconduct. Id. In addition, a claimant is disqualified if they\n\n        quit their job without good cause directly related to employment conditions or employer actions.\n\n        Md. Code Ann. Lab. & Empl. \u00a7 8-1001(a).\n\n        177.   If a determination involves a resolution of a dispute of material fact, a claims examiner\n\n        from the Maryland Department of Labor must conduct a predetermination fact-finding interview\n\n        after notice is provided to the employee and her employer(s). Md. Code. Ann. Lab & Empl. \u00a7 8-\n\n        806(a)(2). Thereafter, a written initial determination must be made stating, among other things, the\n\n        weekly benefit amount, maximum benefits payable to the claimant in a benefit year, and the\n\n        reasons for the determination. Md. Code Ann. Lab. & Empl. \u00a7 8-806(c).\n\n        178.   If the claims examiner\u2019s review of a claim reveals no dispute of material fact, but the\n\n        information reviewed indicates that claimant may be ineligible or disqualified, the claims\n\n        examiners must still schedule a call for an appointment for a fact-finding interview and render a\n\n        written decision. COMAR 09.32.16(D)-(E). A claimant or an employer may file an administrative\n\n        appeal within 15 days. Md. Code Ann. Lab. & Empl. \u00a7 8-806(e)(1).\n\n        179.   The Maryland Department of Labor\u2019s latest data indicates that 813 former federal\n\n        employees have applied for unemployment benefits since January 21, 2025.\n\n\n\n\n                                                        37\n                                                     ADD.97\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 8     Filed: 03/17/2025 Pg: 125 of 171\n             Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA Document 1 Filed 03/06/25 Page 38 of 55\n\n\n\n        180.      As noted above, the number of UCFE claims received by the Maryland Department of\n\n        Labor has increased significantly in just the last few weeks, starting on or around February 14,\n\n        2025, with an approximate range of 30 to 60 new such claims every day.\n\n        181.      In fact, the amount of UCFE claims received by the Maryland Department of Labor in\n\n        February 2025 is significantly higher than past years. From January 21 to March 3, 2024,\n\n        Maryland received only 189 unemployment claims containing federal wages in the claimant\u2019s base\n\n        period.\n\n        182.      While not required to apply for unemployment benefits, multiple individuals have attached\n\n        in their application their letter of employment termination from the federal government. Such\n\n        letters indicate that these individuals were probationary employees purportedly terminated for\n\n        cause.\n\n        183.      When an employer provides the initial report of separation to the Maryland Department of\n\n        Labor, the employer must indicate the reason for the separation, including whether the employee\n\n        was fired for cause, such as misconduct.\n\n        184.      Accordingly, if an employer states in its report of separation that an individual was\n\n        terminated because performance has not been adequate to justify further employment at the\n\n        agency, the Maryland Department of Labor\u2019s procedures require that the claims examiner must\n\n        investigate the reason for discharge.\n\n        185.      The Maryland Department of Labor is also required to verify both wages and reason for\n\n        separation of employment from each federal agency by sending a request for wage and separation\n\n        information. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 609.6(e)(1), 609.21 through 609.25. While private employers report\n\n        wages each quarter for all employees into the Department\u2019s database, see COMAR 09.32.01.12,\n\n        federal agencies are not required to regularly report active employee wages to the States.\n\n\n\n\n                                                         38\n                                                     ADD.98\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 8     Filed: 03/17/2025 Pg: 126 of 171\n             Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA Document 1 Filed 03/06/25 Page 39 of 55\n\n\n\n        186.   The same Department staff who handle regular unemployment claims also process and\n\n        adjudicate UCFE claims. Redirecting staff from handling regular UI claims to process and\n\n        adjudicate UCFE claims threatens to strain the state\u2019s resources.\n\n        187.   This diversion of personnel will undoubtedly impede the timely processing of regular UI\n\n        claims, creating significant backlogs and delays. The consequences will be far-reaching, affecting\n\n        countless individuals who depend on swift resolutions to sustain their livelihoods. By diverting\n\n        resources, the state must compromise the efficiency and responsiveness of its claims processing\n\n        system, ultimately undermining public trust and exacerbating economic hardship.\n\n        188.   While the Maryland Department of Labor is only beginning to process these claims, its\n\n        staff has already begun contacting relevant federal agencies to request information on relevant\n\n        terminations, to determine if they were in fact done for cause\n\n        189.   Thus far, Maryland has received at least 193 reports of separation from federal agencies,\n\n        concerning their recently terminated employees.\n\n        190.   Several Defendant agencies reported that probationary employees were terminated due to\n\n        a \u201cpermanent lack of work due to a change in Presidential Administration.\u201d\n\n        191.   In addition, the Maryland Department of Labor received several reports from Defendant\n\n        agencies explicitly stating that the employees were \u201claid off due to a reduction in force.\u201d\n\n        192.   And, as relevant here, certain reports by Defendants asserted that the employee at issue\n\n        was terminated for cause, for instance due to \u201cunsatisfactory work performance\u201d and similar\n\n        generic performance-related bases.\n\n        193.   Similarly, other reports highlighted various potentially disqualifying circumstances. For\n\n        instance, agencies indicated that claimants might not be genuinely unemployed or had voluntarily\n\n        resigned from their positions.\n\n\n\n\n                                                        39\n                                                     ADD.99\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 8     Filed: 03/17/2025 Pg: 127 of 171\n             Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA Document 1 Filed 03/06/25 Page 40 of 55\n\n\n\n        194.   Due Defendants\u2019 assertions that certain federal employees were terminated for cause or\n\n        otherwise ineligible or disqualified from benefits, or where there is disputed or conflicting\n\n        information, Maryland will be required to follow our intensive and mandatory investigative\n\n        process.\n\n        195.   The procedures impose a significant strain on the Maryland Department of Labor\u2019s\n\n        financial and temporal resources. Each case demanding interviews and/or a fact-finding\n\n        proceeding necessitates extensive staff hours for scheduling, conducting interviews, reviewing\n\n        evidence, and drafting detailed decisions. The need to send notices, accommodate witness\n\n        testimony, and facilitate cross-examination further escalates the time commitment. Moreover, the\n\n        potential for subsequent appeals triggers a cascade of additional hearings and reviews, diverting\n\n        resources from other essential departmental functions.\n\n        196.   Moreover, where federal agencies fail to provide responses to requests for separation\n\n        information, the Maryland Department of Labor must gather necessary wage and separation\n\n        information. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 609.6 (e)(2). This requires claims staff to solicit evidence from the\n\n        claimants in the form of pay stubs, W-2s and affidavits and to pay benefits based on that\n\n        information. In fact, recent federal guidance regarding federal unemployment during recent\n\n        government shutdowns encourages states to have claimants file an affidavit, using available proof,\n\n        given \u201climited federal HR resources\u201d to respond to requests for separation information.\n\n        \u201cUnemployment Insurance Program Letter 03-22,\u201d U.S. Department of Labor, November 2022,\n\n        https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/ETA/advisories/UIPL/2021/UIPL_03-22.pdf.\n\n        197.   In addition, termination notices issued by federal agencies were not issued in compliance\n\n        with governing reduction in force procedures. It is apparent that there are affected individuals,\n\n        including veterans, who should have been accorded preference under required RIF procedures but\n\n\n\n\n                                                       40\n                                                   ADD.100\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 8     Filed: 03/17/2025 Pg: 128 of 171\n             Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA Document 1 Filed 03/06/25 Page 41 of 55\n\n\n\n        were not. To the extent that preferences and other such requirements would have precluded\n\n        termination, and federal employees successfully challenge their separations, this will cause the\n\n        Department to re-adjudicate claims, pursue overpayments, and conduct appeals.\n\n        198.   While the federal Government provides grants for the purpose of administrating state\n\n        unemployment benefit programs, these grants are frequently less than the total administrative costs\n\n        incurred by Maryland. And that is the case now; the federal grant monies allocated to Maryland\n\n        are not sufficient to cover Maryland\u2019s unemployment benefit program administration.\n\n        199.   In these circumstances, Maryland relies on its Special Administrative Expense Fund\n\n        (\u201cSAEF\u201d) when federal funding is insufficient. See Md. Code Ann., Labor & Employment \u00a7\u00a7 8-\n\n        419 to 842. This fund may be comprised of previously transferred federal funds (in limited\n\n        circumstances), as well as monies collected by the state through fines, interest, and other penalties,\n\n        and contributions by the state legislature. Id. \u00a7 8-421. Currently, SAEF is comprised entirely of\n\n        state funds. Accordingly, any increase in administrative costs of Maryland\u2019s unemployment\n\n        benefits program will be covered at least in part by state funds.\n\n        200.   Other Plaintiff States must also undergo intensive and mandatory investigation and appeal\n\n        processes for handling disputes between claimants and employers involving the claimant\u2019s\n\n        eligibility. Many Plaintiff States anticipate a significant increase in these disputes given the\n\n        Defendants\u2019 chaotic and conflicting messaging around the reasons for terminating probationary\n\n        employees. Handling these disputes will cause those Plaintiff States to divert staff to handle the\n\n        time-consuming dispute resolutions and hinder the timely processing of ordinary unemployment\n\n        claims that are not disputed.\n\n        201.   For example, the Illinois Department of Employment Security (\u201cIDES\u201d) has already\n\n        received almost the same number of applications for unemployment benefits from former federal\n\n\n\n\n                                                         41\n                                                     ADD.101\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 8     Filed: 03/17/2025 Pg: 129 of 171\n             Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA Document 1 Filed 03/06/25 Page 42 of 55\n\n\n\n        workers this year as it received in all of last year. A substantial number of these claims require\n\n        resource intensive fact-finding that will cause backlogs and delays in IDES\u2019s processing of other\n\n        claims, exacerbating economic hardship for countless Illinoisans.\n\n        202.   IDES is also being forced to divert resources and staff to respond to the latest layoff news,\n\n        to identify affected federal agencies and ex-employees, provide information, and adjust procedures\n\n        and resources to assist confused and unemployed workers in Illinois, all in a complicated and\n\n        rapidly evolving environment. To take one example, IDES had to create a new webpage, at\n\n        significant time and expense, in an attempt to provide resources and services. See\n\n        https://ides.illinois.gov/unemployment/deferred-resignation-of-federal-employees.html.        Such\n\n        efforts could normally be targeted at specific personnel subject to impending layoff events but\n\n        must instead be provided less efficiently and at greater expense to the entire public because IDES\n\n        personnel remain unaware of the individuals who have already been laid off and whether and when\n\n        the next federal mass layoff event will occur.\n\n        203.    In some jurisdictions, a flood of contested UI claims will cause a backlog that affects the\n\n        timely adjudication of a wide range of administrative matters that are handled by the same\n\n        administrative law judges (\u201cALJs\u201d), ranging from building code enforcement to traffic tickets.\n\n        204.   Plaintiff States have seen or anticipate seeing an uptick in UI claims in the areas in which\n\n        the probationary employee layoffs occurred. This sudden increase\u2014without any advanced\n\n        notice\u2014has burdened and will continue to burden state agencies charged with administering UI\n\n        benefits.\n\n\n\n\n                                                         42\n                                                    ADD.102\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 8     Filed: 03/17/2025 Pg: 130 of 171\n             Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA Document 1 Filed 03/06/25 Page 43 of 55\n\n\n\n                                      Expenditures for Other Social Services\n\n        205.   Plaintiff States bear other burdens associated with many residents suddenly losing income.\n\n        These costs arise in the administration of programs aimed at providing connections to social\n\n        services, like health care and food assistance.\n\n        206.   Newly unemployed individuals apply for Medicaid at high rates, and the Plaintiff States\n\n        bear a direct economic cost to provide healthcare services to them and their families.\n\n                         Harms to State Programs That Depend on Federal Employees\n\n        207.   Many federal probationary employees who were terminated by the CDC were detailed to\n\n        work at Plaintiff States\u2019 public health agencies. This includes several employees who were hired\n\n        by the CDC as part of its Public Health Associate Program for Recent Graduates (\u201cPHAP\u201d). PHAP\n\n        is a two-year program that places recent college graduates with tribal, local, and territorial public\n\n        health agencies, as well as non-governmental organizations, to work alongside other public health\n\n        professionals in a variety of settings.\n\n        208.   For example, three recently terminated PHAP employees (\u201cAssociates\u201d) were assigned to\n\n        New Jersey\u2019s Department of Health (\u201cNJDOH\u201d), which is responsible for preventing the spread\n\n        of infectious diseases and developing emergency preparedness plans in the state. CDC and\n\n        NJDOH entered into a two-year contract, pursuant to which CDC agreed to cover all costs for the\n\n        Associates, including salary and benefits. NJDOH has participated in the PHAP program for\n\n        several years and often hires PHAP Associates, who gain invaluable training and institutional\n\n        knowledge over the course of the program, for permanent employment at the conclusion of their\n\n        two-year term.\n\n        209.   The three Associates were detailed to different NJDOH divisions that perform core public\n\n        health functions: the Division of HIV, STD, and TB Services; the Epidemiology, Environmental\n\n\n\n\n                                                          43\n                                                    ADD.103\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 8     Filed: 03/17/2025 Pg: 131 of 171\n             Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA Document 1 Filed 03/06/25 Page 44 of 55\n\n\n\n        and Occupational Health\u2019s Communicable Disease Service; and the Global Tuberculosis Institute\n\n        at Rutgers University. Each Associate was a member of a small team dedicated to reducing the\n\n        spread of communicable diseases such as HIV, TB, and foodborne and waterborne illnesses. This\n\n        work involved laborious investigations, contact tracing, and collaborations with numerous local,\n\n        state, and federal partners to ensure anyone infected or at risk of infection has access to treatment.\n\n        210.   Between February 16 and 17, 2025, NJDOH learned that the three Associates had been\n\n        terminated from their positions on February 15, 2025\u2014before the expiration of their contractual\n\n        two-year terms. CDC never notified NJDOH of these terminations. Between March 4 and 5,\n\n        NJDOH learned that the Associates were being reinstated.\n\n        211.   Despite their reinstatement, the sudden loss of essential personnel, coupled with the lack\n\n        of notice, caused NJDOH significant harm and disruption. NJDOH had invested significant time\n\n        and resources into months-long training for the Associates, and the agency did not have the\n\n        budgetary flexibility or hiring authority to replace them, particularly given the lack of any notice.\n\n        The unexpected staffing shortages and imminent need to reallocate and train existing staff already\n\n        caused delays and administrative chaos, which impeded NJDOH\u2019s ability to fulfill its mission of\n\n        limiting the spread of infectious diseases in the state. The timing of the terminations was especially\n\n        problematic because NJDOH has been dealing with numerous communicable disease challenges,\n\n        including H5N1, measles, Covid-19, influenza, norovirus, and RSV. The loss in workforce\n\n        capacity during this time hampered NJDOH\u2019s ability to fully respond to these public health threats.\n\n        212.   The lack of notice compounded the challenges created by the terminations. NJDOH was\n\n        not able to plan for the terminations, resulting in administrative inefficiencies, duplicative work,\n\n        and delayed notifications to persons exposed to certain communicable diseases.\n\n\n\n\n                                                         44\n                                                     ADD.104\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 8     Filed: 03/17/2025 Pg: 132 of 171\n             Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA Document 1 Filed 03/06/25 Page 45 of 55\n\n\n\n                                             Harms to State Finances\n\n        213.   The mass layoffs that have taken place without the legally required notice to Plaintiff States\n\n        will also have substantial impacts on the Plaintiff States\u2019 finances.\n\n        214.   For instance, the U.S. Secretary of Labor has discretion to reimburse states for\n\n        administrative costs required to conduct the state unemployment compensation program. 42 U.S.C.\n\n        \u00a7 502(a). While many Plaintiff States have been and continue to expend additional resources\n\n        necessary to address the uptick in federal unemployment claims, it is not yet known whether those\n\n        additional costs will be fully reimbursed.\n\n        215.   Further, Plaintiff States rely in large part on income tax revenue for their budgets. Because\n\n        Defendant agencies will no longer be withholding and paying income taxes to Plaintiff States on\n\n        behalf of the terminated probationary employees, the layoffs will result in a decrease to Plaintiff\n\n        States\u2019 revenues. Given the number of employees forced to seek reemployment\u2014with no notice\n\n        and no opportunity for Plaintiff States to provide support services\u2014it is highly likely that many of\n\n        the Plaintiff States\u2019 residents will be unemployed for prolonged periods, depriving the Plaintiff\n\n        States of significant income tax receipts.\n\n        216.   For example, the District of Columbia estimates that the mass terminations of probationary\n\n        employees will cause millions of dollars in lost annual income tax revenue. The District estimates\n\n        that its lost income tax revenue for the first 60 days alone, the period in which it should have\n\n        received advance notice of any RIFs, will cost the District at least hundreds of thousands of dollars\n\n        in lost income tax revenue. Had the District received the notice required by law, these losses would\n\n        likely have been mitigated, including because employees would not have been terminated during\n\n        the 60-day notice period and some would have been able to obtain alternative employment prior\n\n        to their termination.\n\n\n\n\n                                                         45\n                                                     ADD.105\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 8     Filed: 03/17/2025 Pg: 133 of 171\n             Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA Document 1 Filed 03/06/25 Page 46 of 55\n\n\n\n        217.   Likewise, the Maryland Comptroller projects that the mass terminations of probationary\n\n        employees will cause significant decreases in Maryland\u2019s income tax revenues. Maryland\u2019s budget\n\n        relies in large part on personal income tax revenue, which represented 55% of Maryland\u2019s general\n\n        fund revenues for fiscal year 2024. Approximately 250,000 federal workers reside in Maryland.\n\n        Although unemployed individuals receiving unemployment benefits generally pay income tax on\n\n        their benefits, the benefits paid are less than the amount the individuals earned when they were\n\n        fully employed, and therefore the taxes paid are generally less than the taxes paid during their\n\n        employment.\n\n        218.   Beyond the direct loss of income tax revenue, the Maryland Comptroller anticipates that a\n\n        sudden and significant increase of newly unemployed workers will have serious negative effects\n\n        on Maryland\u2019s labor market, including extended periods of unemployment, downward pressure on\n\n        wages, and the migration of residents out of the state.\n\n        219.   The terminations also impact state sales tax revenues.\n\n        220.   For example, for the District of Columbia, this impact comes from two primary sources:\n\n        First, federal employees living outside of the District who commute to work in the District\n\n        purchase meals at restaurants, pay parking fees, and purchase other goods and services before,\n\n        during, and after work. Second, in addition to these workday purchases, federal employees who\n\n        are District residents also contribute to our economy as full-time residents, spending on groceries,\n\n        household items, restaurants, clothing, and various services.\n\n        221.   The District estimates that these mass terminations could cause anywhere from hundreds\n\n        of thousands to millions of dollars in lost annual sales tax revenue. The District further estimates\n\n        that for the first 60 days alone, the period in which it should have received advance notice of any\n\n        RIFs, the District will lose tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars in sales tax revenues.

Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate herein by reference every allegation and paragraph set\n\n        forth previously.\n\n        223.   Under the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d), a court shall \u201chold unlawful and set\n\n        aside agency action . . . found to be . . . arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise\n\n        not in accordance with law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A).\n\n        224.   Defendants are agencies subject to the APA. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701.\n\n        225.   Because Defendants\u2019 mass terminations of probationary employees are part of an effort to\n\n        restructure and reduce the federal workforce, they constitute RIFs, and Defendants were obligated\n\n        to follow RIF procedures set forth by statute and regulation to carry out the terminations. See 5\n\n        U.S.C. \u00a7 3502; 5 C.F.R. Part 351.\n\n        226.   Defendants violated the law by carrying out the mass terminations of probationary\n\n        employees without following the required RIF procedures, see 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502; 5 C.F.R. Part 351,\n\n        including providing 60 days\u2019 notice to states and affected employees before releasing the\n\n        employees, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d). Absent such notice, an employee \u201cmay not be released.\u201d 5 U.S.C.\n\n        \u00a7 3502(d).\n\n        227.   The actions of Defendants therefore violate the APA because they are not in accordance\n\n        with law in violation of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A).\n\n\n                                                          47\n                                                     ADD.107\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 8     Filed: 03/17/2025 Pg: 135 of 171\n             Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA Document 1 Filed 03/06/25 Page 48 of 55\n\n\n\n                                                  COUNT II\n                                Violation of the Administrative Procedures Act\n                                           Arbitrary and Capricious\n\n        228.   Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate herein by reference every allegation and paragraph set\n\n        forth previously.\n\n        229.   Under the APA, a court shall \u201chold unlawful and set aside agency action . . . found to be\n\n        . . . arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d 5 U.S.C.\n\n        \u00a7 706(2)(A).\n\n        230.   Defendants are agencies subject to the APA. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701.\n\n        231.   The terminations of probationary employees pursuant to OPM\u2019s order have been arbitrary\n\n        and capricious in several respects, including:\n\n        232.   Defendants OPM and OPM Director failed to provide a reasoned explanation for their\n\n        direction to agencies to carry out mass terminations of probationary employees without following\n\n        RIF procedures.\n\n        233.   Defendants failed to provide a reasoned explanation for following OPM\u2019s direction and\n\n        carrying out mass terminations of probationary employees.\n\n        234.   Third, to the extent Defendants provided any explanation at all for the mass terminations,\n\n        the reasons given were pretextual as they purported to relate to individual employees\u2019 performance\n\n        but did not identify any actual unsatisfactory performance or conduct or any reasons preceding the\n\n        affected employees\u2019 appointments that justified their terminations. Rather than Defendants\u2019 stated\n\n        reasons, Defendants\u2019 true reason for terminating the probationary employees was to reduce the\n\n        size of the federal workforce.\n\n        235.   The arbitrariness of Defendants\u2019 actions and the indiscriminate nature of the terminations\n\n        is underscored by the fact that Defendants have had to reverse the firings of individuals fulfilling\n\n\n\n\n                                                          48\n                                                     ADD.108\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 8     Filed: 03/17/2025 Pg: 136 of 171\n             Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA Document 1 Filed 03/06/25 Page 49 of 55\n\n\n\n        certain critical functions, such as protecting nuclear weapons and addressing a significant public\n\n        health threat.\n\n                                                 COUNT III\n                                      Non-Statutory Review of Ultra Vires Action\n\n        236.    Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate herein by reference every allegation and paragraph set\n\n        forth previously.\n\n        237.    Plaintiffs have a non-statutory right of action to enjoin and declare unlawful official action\n\n        that is ultra vires.\n\n        238.    Defendants mass terminations of probationary employees were RIFs. These RIFs were\n\n        unlawful because Defendants conducted them without following required RIF procedures, see 5\n\n        U.S.C. \u00a7 3502; 5 C.F.R. Part 351, including providing 60 days\u2019 notice to states and affected\n\n        employees before releasing the employees, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d). Absent such notice, an employee\n\n        \u201cmay not be released.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d).\n\n        239.    Defendants\u2019 actions terminating probationary employees en masse therefore exceeded their\n\n        lawful authority and were ultra vires.\n\n        240.    Plaintiffs will suffer irreparable injury if Defendants\u2019 actions are not declared unlawful and\n\n        enjoined, and Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law.\n\n        241.    The public interest favors issuance of a judicial declaration that Defendants\u2019 terminations\n\n        of federal probationary employees are unlawful and issuance of an injunction requiring Defendants\n\n        to reinstate the affected employees and to follow RIF procedures for any further RIFs. Defendants\u2019\n\n        actions have resulted in the unlawful termination of tens of thousands of probationary federal\n\n        employees, including large numbers of military veterans, causing a sudden surge of unemployment\n\n        without providing Plaintiff States with notice or an opportunity to prepare.\n\n\n\n\n                                                         49\n                                                     ADD.109\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 8     Filed: 03/17/2025 Pg: 137 of 171\n             Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA Document 1 Filed 03/06/25 Page 50 of 55\n\n\n\n                                           PRAYER FOR RELIEF\n\n               WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court:\n\n        242.   Declare unlawful and set aside Defendants\u2019 terminations of probationary employees\n\n        without making specific, individualized determinations regarding the employees\u2019 performance or\n\n        conduct and without adhering to RIF requirements as arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion,\n\n        or otherwise not in accordance with law under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A);\n\n        243.   Declare unlawful and set aside Defendants\u2019 terminations of probationary employees\n\n        without making specific, individualized determinations regarding the employees\u2019 performance or\n\n        conduct and without adhering to RIF requirements as ultra vires and exceeding their lawful\n\n        authority;\n\n        244.   Issue immediate temporary relief restraining Defendants from terminating any\n\n        probationary employees without making specific, individualized determinations regarding the\n\n        inadequacy of the employee\u2019s conduct or performance and reinstating probationary employees\n\n        who were terminated on or after January 20, 2025, as part of mass terminations that did not comply\n\n        with RIF procedures and were not based on individualized determinations of the inadequacy of the\n\n        employee\u2019s conduct or performance;\n\n        245.   Order Defendants to file a status report with the Court within 48 hours of entry of a\n\n        temporary restraining order, and at regular intervals thereafter, identifying all probationary\n\n        employees terminated on or after January 20, 2025 (including the following information for each\n\n        employee: agency, name, position title, grade, termination date, whether the probationary\n\n        employee has been reinstated, and the date of any reinstatement), and reporting all steps that\n\n        Defendants have taken to comply with the Court\u2019s temporary restraining order;\n\n\n\n\n                                                       50\n                                                   ADD.110\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 8     Filed: 03/17/2025 Pg: 138 of 171\n             Case 1:25-cv-00748-ABA Document 1 Filed 03/06/25 Page 51 of 55\n\n\n\n        246.   Enter preliminary and permanent injunctive relief enjoining any further terminations that\n\n        do not follow the RIF requirements or requirements for separating probationary employees for\n\n        performance and enjoining Defendants from separating any employees pursuant to a RIF prior to\n\n        the reinstatement of the probationary employees described above;\n\n        247.    Award to Plaintiffs their costs of litigation including, but not limited to, reasonable\n\n        attorneys\u2019 fees, under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412, and any other applicable law; and\n\n        248.

The action has\n\n        no hope of success, because third parties cannot interject themselves into the employment\n\n        relationship between the United States and government workers, which is governed by a\n\n        comprehensive statutory scheme that provides an exclusive remedial avenue to challenge adverse\n\n        personnel actions. The States cannot circumvent that channeling scheme by asserting downstream\n\n        harm from those employment actions. Nor do the States have any legitimate claims of their own.\n\n        The Court should therefore deny their motion for a temporary restraining order (\u201cTRO\u201d).\n\n               Notably, this is not the first lawsuit to seek this relief. A set of unions sued in federal court\n\n        in the District of Columbia a few weeks ago to rescind the termination of the probationary workers.\n\n        National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU) v. Trump, No. 25-cv-420 (CRC), 2025 WL 561080,\n\n        at *1 (Feb. 20, 2025). The district court denied relief based on the exclusive channeling regime.\n\n        See id. Then, other unions and organizational plaintiffs sued in the Northern District of California,\n\n        also claiming downstream harms from the terminations. While the court there agreed to restrain\n\n        since-revised guidance on probationary removals from the Office of Personnel Management\n\n        (OPM), it acknowledged that it could not and would not rescind terminations. See Am. Fed\u2019n of\n\n        Gov\u2019t Emps. (AFGE) v. Ezell, et al., No. C 25-01780 WHA (N.D. Cal).\n\n               The third time is not the charm. Like the unions and the organizational plaintiffs, the States\n\n        are strangers to the employment relationships at issue, and cannot disrupt the exclusive remedial\n\n        scheme that Congress put in place to adjudicate these disputes. Beyond that, the States fail to\n\n        identify any act Defendants have taken inconsistent with law. Nor can they carry their burden to\n\n        establish irreparable harm or that the public interest favors the extraordinary relief they seek.\n\n\n\n                                                          1\n\n                                                     ADD.118\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248    Doc: 8     Filed: 03/17/2025 Pg: 146 of 171\n              Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document 20 Filed 03/10/25 Page 4 of 29\n\n\n\n                                                 BACKGROUND\n\n            I.      Statutory and Regulatory Background\n\n                 Probationers are individuals whose employment with the federal government has not been\n\n        finalized. See 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.804. \u201cThe purpose of the probationary period is to provide the\n\n        Government with an opportunity to evaluate an individual\u2019s conduct and performance on the job\n\n        to determine if an appointment to the civil service should become final.\u201d Merit Systems Protection\n\n        Board, \u201cThe Probationary Period: A Critical Assessment Opportunity\u201d i (August 2005).1 The\n\n        probationary period enables agencies \u201cto determine an individual\u2019s potential to fulfill the needs of\n\n        the specific position, the agency, and the civil service.\u201d Id. at ii. Probationers should \u201cbe assessed\n\n        in light of the organization\u2019s strategic goals and the role of the position in the accomplishment of\n\n        those goals.\u201d Id. at 22. \u201cUntil the probationary period has been completed, a probationer is still an\n\n        applicant for an appointment, with the burden to demonstrate why it is in the public interest for the\n\n        Government to finalize an appointment to the civil service for this particular individual.\u201d Id.\n\n        Termination is mandatory where this showing is not made; an \u201cagency . . . shall terminate [a\n\n        probationer\u2019s] services . . . if the employee fails to demonstrate fully his or her qualifications for\n\n        continued employment.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.803(a).\n\n                 Employment-related disputes between federal employees and their employing agencies\n\n        within the Executive Branch\u2014including challenges to employee removals or terminations\u2014are\n\n        governed by the comprehensive, reticulated administrative-judicial review scheme set forth in the\n\n        Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2101 et seq. That expansive scheme also includes\n\n        parallel provisions governing labor relations between agencies and their employees, the Federal\n\n\n        1\n          See\n        https://www.mspb.gov/studies/studies/The_Probationary_Period_A_Critical_Assessment_Oppor\n        tunity_224555.pdf.\n                                                          2\n\n                                                     ADD.119\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248    Doc: 8     Filed: 03/17/2025 Pg: 147 of 171\n              Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document 20 Filed 03/10/25 Page 5 of 29\n\n\n\n        Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (\u201cthe Statute\u201d or \u201cFSL-MRS\u201d), set forth in Title VII\n\n        of the CSRA (codified at 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7101-35). Taken as a whole, the scheme governs nearly all\n\n        aspects of the federal employer-employee relationship, and largely covers the field when it comes\n\n        to judicial rights and remedies for alleged constitutional and statutory violations arising out of that\n\n        relationship. As the D.C. Circuit has put it, \u201cwhat you get under the CSRA is what you get.\u201d\n\n        Fornaro v. James, 416 F.3d 63, 67 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (then-Judge Roberts).\n\n               Relevant here, the CSRA \u201cestablishe[s] a comprehensive system for reviewing personnel\n\n        action taken against federal employees.\u201d Elgin v. Dep\u2019t of the Treasury, 567 U.S. 1, 5 (2012)\n\n        (citation omitted). If an agency takes a statutorily defined major adverse action against a covered\n\n        employee\u2014including removal, see 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7512\u2014the employee may appeal that action to the\n\n        Merit Systems Protection Board (\u201cMSPB\u201d) under the provisions of the CSRA\u2019s Chapter 75. Id.\n\n        \u00a7 7513(d). The MSPB may order relief to prevailing employees, including reinstatement, backpay,\n\n        and attorney\u2019s fees. Id. \u00a7\u00a7 1204(a)(2), 7701(g). Final MSPB decisions generally are appealable to\n\n        the Federal Circuit, which has \u201cexclusive jurisdiction\u201d over such appeals. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(9).\n\n        This review scheme is \u201cexclusive, even for employees who bring constitutional challenges to\n\n        federal statutes.\u201d Elgin, 567 U.S. at 13. Other than limited circumstances, it does not permit\n\n        covered employees to bring suit in federal district court. Id. at 14-15; United States v. Fausto, 484\n\n        U.S. 439, 447 (1988); Fornaro, 416 F.3d at 67.\n\n               Terminated probationers generally do not enjoy the same guaranteed right to appeal\n\n        removal decisions to the MSPB, as Congress placed them outside the definition of \u201cemployee[s]\u201d\n\n        for purposes of the CSRA\u2019s Chapter 75. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7511(a)(1). Instead, probationers remain\n\n        properly considered \u201capplicants\u201d under the extended hiring and evaluation period the CSRA sets\n\n        forth for new career employees. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7511(a)(1)(A)-(B), (C); 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.801,\n\n\n\n                                                          3\n\n                                                     ADD.120\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248    Doc: 8     Filed: 03/17/2025 Pg: 148 of 171\n              Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document 20 Filed 03/10/25 Page 6 of 29\n\n\n\n        301.806.2 But that does not leave them without recourse for alleged constitutional or statutory\n\n        violations by their employing agencies: the CSRA\u2019s Chapter 23, which sets forth the merit system\n\n        principles underlying the entire statutory scheme and provides remedies for alleged violations of\n\n        those principles, generally applies to both \u201capplicants and employees.\u201d See, e.g., 5 U.S.C.\n\n        \u00a7 2302(a)(2)(A)(i)\u2013(xii) (identifying \u201cpersonnel action[s]\u201d that may form the basis for alleged\n\n        prohibited personnel practices \u201cwith respect to an employee in, or applicant for, a covered position\n\n        in any agency\u201d).\n\n               Thus, probationers whose employment has been terminated by their employing agencies\n\n        may in appropriate circumstances pursue relief that may result in MSPB adjudication, with judicial\n\n        review potentially available after the completion of that process. There are at least two routes to\n\n        such review. First, a removed probationer may file a complaint alleging one or more statutorily\n\n        defined \u201cprohibited personnel practices\u201d with the Office of Special Counsel, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1211-\n\n        1219, et seq., which is statutorily charged with investigating such complaints and which may in\n\n        turn pursue administrative relief before the MSPB.3 Second, under OPM regulations, a removed\n\n        probationer may appeal to the MSPB if they allege that the removal was based upon one of the\n\n        reasons set forth in the regulations. See id. \u00a7 315.806.\n\n\n        2\n          As noted supra, OPM regulations promulgated under the CSRA provide that agencies are to use\n        the probationary or trial period \u201cas fully as possible to determine the fitness of the employee and\n        shall terminate his or her services during this period if the employee fails to demonstrate fully his\n        or her qualifications for continued employment.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.803(a). When an agency decides\n        to terminate an employee covered by these regulations because his or her work performance or\n        conduct during the probationary or trial period fails to demonstrate fitness or qualifications for\n        continued employment, it must notify the employee and provide \u201cthe agency\u2019s conclusions as to\n        the inadequacies of his [or her] performance or conduct.\u201d Id. \u00a7 315.804(a).\n        3\n          Congress also created the Office of Special Counsel to, among other things, protect employees,\n        applicants for employment, and former employees. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1212. The Special Counsel may\n        receive and investigate complaints of prohibited personnel practices and may petition the MSPB\n        for a stay of the personnel actions pending investigation, and based on the results of an\n        investigation, seek corrective action from the Board.

Factual Background\n\n                 A. OPM\u2019s January 20 Guidance Memorandum on Probationary Periods and\n                    Revised March 4 Guidance Memorandum\n\n                 President Trump campaigned on a promise to raise standards for federal government\n\n        employment and improve the Civil Service workforce. On his first day in office, President Trump\n\n        signed a memorandum declaring that \u201cAmerican citizens deserve an excellent and efficient Federal\n\n        workforce that attracts the highest caliber of civil servants committed to achieving the freedom,\n\n        prosperity, and democratic rule that our Constitution promotes.\u201d Reforming the Federal Hiring\n\n        Process and Restoring Merit to Government Service (Jan. 20, 2025). Consistent with the new\n\n        administration\u2019s focus on federal employee performance, OPM Acting Director Charles Ezell\n\n        transmitted a guidance memo to Executive Branch agencies identifying probationary periods as\n\n        \u201can essential tool for agencies to assess employee performance.\u201d Mem. from Charles Ezell, Acting\n\n        Director, U.S. Office of Personnel Management, to Heads and Acting Heads of Departments and\n\n        Agencies, titled \u201cGuidance on Probationary Periods, Administrative Leave and Details,\u201d at 1 (Jan.\n\n        20, 2025) (\u201cOPM Mem.\u201d).

Executive Order 14,210\n\n               On February 11, 2025, President Trump signed Executive Order 14,210, which\n\n        \u201ccommences a critical transformation of the Federal bureaucracy\u201d to \u201crestore accountability to the\n\n        American public\u201d by \u201celiminating waste, bloat and insularity.\u201d Implementing the President\u2019s\n\n        \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency\u201d Workforce Optimization Initiative, Exec.

The Workforce E.O. directed\n\n        the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (\u201cOMB\u201d) to \u201csubmit a plan to reduce the\n\n        size of the Federal Government\u2019s workforce through efficiency improvements and attrition.\u201d Id.\n\n        \u00a7 3. It further required that new career appointment hiring decisions shall be made \u201cin consultation\n\n        with the agency\u2019s DOGE Team Lead, consistent with applicable law,\u201d and that the agency shall\n\n        not fill vacancies for career appointments that the DOGE Team Lead assesses should not be filled,\n\n        \u201cunless the Agency Head determines the positions should be filled.\u201d Id. \u00a7 3(b)(i)\u2013(ii).\n\n               The Workforce E.O. directed agency heads to \u201cpromptly undertake preparations to initiate\n\n        large-scale reductions in force (RIFs), consistent with applicable law, and to separate from Federal\n\n        service temporary employees and reemployed annuitants working in areas that will likely be\n\n        subject to the RIFs.\u201d Id. \u00a7 3(c). The Workforce E.O. also directed the Director of OPM to initiate\n\n        a rulemaking by March 11, 2025 that proposes to revise 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 731.202(b) to include additional\n\n        suitability criteria.

Agency Terminations of Certain Probationers; District Court Challenges and\n                  Stay Proceedings Before the MSPB\n\n               Certain federal agencies have terminated probationers. See, e.g., Mem. Op. & Order at 3,\n\n        NTEU v. Trump, No. 25-cv-420 (CRC), (\u201cNTEU v. Trump\u201d), ECF No. 28 (noting the termination\n\n        of certain probationers working at federal agencies). Legal challenges in district court followed.\n\n        In NTEU v. Trump, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia denied a motion for\n\n        temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction on February 20, holding that the union\n\n        plaintiffs\u2019 claims fell outside of district court jurisdiction under the FSL-MRS and the CSRA.\n\n        NTEU v. Trump, 2025 WL 561080 (Feb. 20, 2025) at *1.\n\n               And in American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) v. Ezell, et al., No. C 25-\n\n        01780 WHA (N.D. Cal), the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California issued a\n\n        narrow temporary restraining order on March 4 enjoining OPM from taking any action\n\n        characterized as \u201cordering\u201d federal agencies to terminate their probationers. Id. at 24.4 (OPM\n\n        maintains that it has never issued any such order, and litigation remains ongoing.) The court, like\n\n        the court in NTEU v. Trump, held that the union plaintiffs\u2019 claims fell outside of its jurisdiction\n\n        under the FSL-MRS and the CSRA. Id. at 11. It concluded, on the basis of the TRO record and\n\n\n\n        4\n           A copy of the North District of California district court transcript in AFGE is attached for the\n        Court\u2019s convenience, as it does not appear to be not available on Westlaw at this time. (Attached\n        as Ex. 1).\n                                                        7\n\n                                                   ADD.124\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248    Doc: 8     Filed: 03/17/2025 Pg: 152 of 171\n             Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document 20 Filed 03/10/25 Page 10 of 29\n\n\n\n        briefing before it, that it could assert limited jurisdiction over certain claims brought against OPM\n\n        by non-union, non-employee organizational plaintiffs. Id. at 21-22. As the States note, OPM has\n\n        issued revised guidance, though they are mistaken that the AFGE court required it. See Id. at 24\n\n        (requiring OPM to notify NPS, BLM, VA, DOD, SBA, and NSF [sic NWS] that any efforts to\n\n        direct the termination of employees \u201care illegal\u201d). At the same time, the court disclaimed any\n\n        power to rescind terminations taken by agencies of their own force; the court understood its role\n\n        as only enjoining OPM from directing such terminations, and ensuring that the agencies\n\n        appreciated the scope of their own decision-making authority.\n\n               On a parallel track, removed probationers have pursued relief before the Office of Special\n\n        Counsel. On February 21, 2025, the Special Counsel requested a stay of the termination of six\n\n        probationers. See Special Counsel\u2019s Initial Request for Stay or Personnel Action, Special Counsel\n\n        ex rel. Doe v. OPM, No. CB-1208-25-17-U-1 (MSPB). On February 25, 2025, the MSPB granted\n\n        that request. See Non-Precedential Stay Order, Special Counsel ex rel. Doe v. OPM, No. CB-1208-\n\n        25-17-U-1 (MSPB). And as recently as March 5, 2025, on a February 28 stay request submitted\n\n        by the Special Counsel on behalf of a J. Doe complainant, the MSPB Chair stayed the removal of\n\n        several thousand USDA probationers, ordering that \u201cMr. Doe shall be placed in the position that\n\n        he held prior to the probationary termination. Likewise, all other probationary employees whom\n\n        the agency has terminated since February 13, 2025, pursuant to letters stating, \u2018The [a]gency finds,\n\n        based on your performance, that you have not demonstrated that your further employment at the\n\n        [a]gency would be in the public interest,\u2019 shall be placed in the positions that they held prior to the\n\n        probationary terminations[.]\u201d See Non-Precedential Stay Order, Special Counsel ex rel.

They cannot make either showing here: they lack standing,\n\n        and their asserted claims would be jurisdictionally channeled away from district court review in\n\n        any event under the comprehensive scheme governing federal employment disputes. They also\n\n        fail to show that Defendants acted inconsistent with law.\n\n                A.      The States Cannot Show Standing.\n\n                To invoke the jurisdiction of this Court, the States \u201cmust show\u201d that they have \u201csuffered,\n\n        or will suffer, an injury that is \u2018concrete, particularized, and actual or imminent; fairly traceable to\n\n        the challenged action; and redressable by a favorable ruling.\u2019\u201d Murthy v. Missouri, 603 U.S. 43,\n\n        57 (2024) (quoting Clapper v. Amnesty Int\u2019l USA, 568 U.S. 398, 409 (2013)). The alleged injury-\n\n        in-fact cannot be \u201cspeculative\u2014meaning that the injury must have already occurred or be likely to\n\n        occur soon.\u201d FDA v.

If the injury has not\n\n        materialized, it must be \u201ccertainly impending,\u201d and \u201c[a]llegations of possible future injury are not\n\n        sufficient.\u201d Clapper, 568 U.S. at 409 (citation omitted). In addition, \u201cstanding is not dispensed in\n\n        gross,\u201d and \u201c\u2018plaintiffs must demonstrate standing for each claim they press\u2019 against each\n\n        defendant, \u2018and for each form of relief that they seek.\u2019\u201d Murthy, 603 U.S. at 61 (quoting\n\n        TransUnion LLC v.

They premise their standing\n\n        assertion primarily on resource-diversion and financial-harm grounds, arguing that removals of\n\n        probationers will result in loss of tax revenue attributable to those employees\u2019 lost income (States\u2019\n\n        Br. at 28); diversion of resources to assist such employees and provide unemployment benefits (id.\n\n        at 24-25) (while conceding unemployment insurance benefits \u201care generally reimbursed by the\n\n        federal government\u201d for federal workers, id. at 25); and increased enrollments in state insurance\n\n        programs (id. at 27).5 Such indirect injuries are insufficient to create standing to sue. In United\n\n        States v. Texas, 599 U.S. 670, 674 (2023), states sued the federal government to challenge an\n\n        immigration policy that would \u201cimpose[] costs on the States.\u201d Id. The States claimed the policy\n\n        would force them to \u201csupply social services such as healthcare and education\u201d to persons it\n\n        otherwise would not. Id. The Supreme Court held the States lacked standing, explaining that\n\n        \u201cfederal courts must remain mindful of bedrock Article III constraints in cases brought by States\n\n        against an executive agency or officer.\u201d Id. at 680 n.3. \u201c[I]n our system of dual federal and state\n\n        sovereignty, federal policies frequently generate indirect effects on state revenues or state\n\n        spending.\u201d Id. \u201cAnd when a State asserts, for example, that a federal law has produced only those\n\n        kinds of indirect effects, the State\u2019s claim for standing can become more attenuated.\u201d Id.\n\n               The absence of a concrete injury is highlighted by the extraordinary breadth of the States\u2019\n\n        suit. Plaintiffs admit that their suit treats the \u201ctermination of tens of thousands of employees\u201d as\n\n        \u201cfinal agency actions subject to this Court\u2019s review.\u201d States\u2019 Br. at 16. And they seek to prevent\n\n\n\n        5\n          The States\u2019 claim they are \u201cstruggling\u201d to provide unemployment insurance and other benefits\n        for terminated probationers warrants skepticism. States\u2019 Br. at 2. The States allege that\n        Defendants have terminated about 24,000 probationers nationwide since January 20.

And the States do not\n        explain what share of the 24,000 allegedly terminated probationers reside in their States, which\n        account for fewer than half of the States overall.\n                                                         11\n\n                                                    ADD.128\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248    Doc: 8     Filed: 03/17/2025 Pg: 156 of 171\n             Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document 20 Filed 03/10/25 Page 14 of 29\n\n\n\n        alleged final agency actions that have not even happened yet in attempting to bar nearly every\n\n        cabinet department and other agencies from terminating probationers in the future. Significantly,\n\n        they fail to connect nearly any of these past and potential future personnel actions to any of the 20\n\n        State plaintiffs. They also offer little specificity with these thousands of purported agency actions.\n\n        The States provide the most detail on terminations made by the National Science Foundation,\n\n        States\u2019 Br. at 11, but that agency\u2019s terminations are not even part of this suit because the States\n\n        chose to omit it as a defendant. The States\u2019 choice to sue 41 Executive Branch officials and\n\n        agencies resembles Murthy, where two States and five individuals \u201csued dozens of Executive\n\n        Branch officials and agencies.\u201d 603 U.S. at 54. The plaintiffs lacked standing to litigate that\n\n        \u201csprawling suit,\u201d id. at 61, the Supreme Court again held, because of the absence of \u201cany concrete\n\n        link between their injuries and the defendants\u2019 conduct,\u201d id. at 76. Here too, \u201cstanding doctrine\n\n        prevents [courts] from \u201cexercis[ing] such general legal oversight\u201d of the other branches of\n\n        Government.\u201d Id.\n\n               And even if those conjectural assertions could suggest an injury-in-fact traceable to\n\n        Defendants\u2019 actions, the States cannot satisfy standing\u2019s redressability prong. All of the States\u2019\n\n        claims derive from those of any removed probationers: the States\u2019 asserted injuries could only be\n\n        conceivably redressed by their reinstatement. But reinstatement of removed probationers is a\n\n        remedy overwhelmingly, if not exclusively, channeled away from federal district courts under the\n\n        CSRA.6 Because the Court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction to award the only remedy that might\n\n\n\n\n        6\n          Limited exceptions to the CSRA\u2019s comprehensive scope exist. For example, Title VII claims are\n        heard in district court, consistent with the CSRA\u2019s exception for claims under that scheme. And\n        certain agencies are subject to different (and similarly preclusive) statutory administrative-judicial\n        review schemes, such as that applicable to Title 38 employees of the Veterans Health\n        Administration, part of the Department of Veterans Affairs. See 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 714.\n                                                         12\n\n                                                     ADD.129\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248    Doc: 8     Filed: 03/17/2025 Pg: 157 of 171\n             Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document 20 Filed 03/10/25 Page 15 of 29\n\n\n\n        redress the States\u2019 claimed harms here, the States cannot show redressability, and thus cannot\n\n        establish standing.\n\n                To flesh this out further, take the States\u2019 asserted loss of tax revenue (States\u2019 Br. at 28).\n\n        Any injury attributable to future lost tax revenue attributable to probationer removals (or future\n\n        probationary removals) in 2025 is neither concrete nor certainly imminent at this point. But even\n\n        if the States could surmount that injury-in-fact hurdle, they cannot show how a federal district\n\n        court could award them any remedy that would redress such injury. The only remedy that might\n\n        restore potential lost tax revenue for any of these States would be reinstatement of the removed\n\n        probationers at issue, thereby restoring them (and their taxable incomes) to the States\u2019 tax bases.\n\n        And under the CSRA, that remedy is unavailable under the facts asserted here.\n\n                As explained above, removals of covered federal employees must generally be appealed to\n\n        the MSPB, with judicial review available exclusively in the Federal Circuit. See Elgin, 567 U.S.\n\n        at 5, 11-13. That administrative-judicial review pathway bypasses district court entirely, even for\n\n        constitutional claims (which the States have not asserted in any event). Id. The same rule holds\n\n        true for probationers, who cannot appeal their removals to the MSPB as of right, but must instead\n\n        pursue relief through the Office of Special Counsel complaint process (which may result in review\n\n        by the MSPB). The bottom line is the same: any administrative-judicial review pathway bypasses\n\n        district court entirely, meaning that district courts lack jurisdiction to review their claims under the\n\n        CSRA. NTEU v. Trump, 2025 WL 561080, at *1. And lacking jurisdiction to review challenges\n\n        to probationary employee removals, federal district courts likewise lack jurisdiction to issue the\n\n        only remedy that might redress the States\u2019 asserted loss of tax revenue.\n\n                The district court opinion in NTEU is particularly instructive here. The unions alleged that\n\n        a large-scale removal of probationers would reduce their membership numbers and revenues,\n\n\n\n                                                          13\n\n                                                      ADD.130\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248    Doc: 8     Filed: 03/17/2025 Pg: 158 of 171\n             Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document 20 Filed 03/10/25 Page 16 of 29\n\n\n\n        divert their resources, and reduce their heft at the bargaining table. 2025 WL 561080 at *6.\n\n        Assessing its jurisdiction over the unions\u2019 claims under the Thunder Basin doctrine, see Part I.B,\n\n        infra, the court concluded that jurisdiction over those claims was channeled exclusively through\n\n        the Federal Labor Relations Authority (\u201cFLRA\u201d), and from there to a court of appeals, under the\n\n        special review scheme established by the FSL-MRS. Id. at **6-7. In particular, the court\n\n        observed, \u201c[if] the FLRA finds an unfair labor practice, for instance, it may \u2018require reinstatement\n\n        of an employee with backpay\u2019\u201d under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7118(a)(7)(C). Id. at *7. And having determined\n\n        both that the unions could pursue their claims through the FLRA, id., and that individual\n\n        employees with appeal status could pursue similar recourse before the MSPB, id. at n.2, the court\n\n        concluded that the jurisdictional scheme is exclusive, thus foreclosing district court review. Id. at\n\n        **5-8. What that means for the States\u2019 standing assertion is this: lacking jurisdiction to even\n\n        consider (much less remedy) the claims of removed employees, district courts cannot redress the\n\n        States\u2019 asserted injuries-in-fact, thus depriving them of Article III standing.\n\n               Not does it matter that the States seek to assert claims under the APA: courts have\n\n        uniformly held that the CSRA precludes claims under the APA. See Hall v. Clinton, 235 F.3d 202,\n\n        206 (4th Cir. 2000); Bolton v. Colvin, 674 Fed. Appx. 282, 290\u201391 (4th Cir. 2017); Mann v. Haigh,\n\n        120 F.3d 34, 38 (4th Cir. 1997). The comprehensive preclusion of APA review (and remedies) for\n\n        those most directly affected by the employment-based actions here, federal employees themselves,\n\n        is no less comprehensive for parties that are affected by those actions (if at all) in a derivative,\n\n        attenuated, and downstream way.\n\n               The same outcome holds true for the States\u2019 other asserted injuries: diversion of assistance\n\n        resources (States\u2019 Br. at 2, 13) and increased enrollment in state-administered insurance programs\n\n        (id. at 27). Here too, the existence of an injury-in-fact is speculative, attenuated, downstream, and\n\n\n\n                                                         14\n\n                                                     ADD.131\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248    Doc: 8     Filed: 03/17/2025 Pg: 159 of 171\n             Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document 20 Filed 03/10/25 Page 17 of 29\n\n\n\n        unproven. But setting that aside, neither of these alleged injuries would be redressable by any\n\n        relief within the Court\u2019s power to award. To prevent or stem the diversion of state assistance\n\n        resources, the Court again would have to order reinstatement of the removed probationers into\n\n        their former agency jobs. And to reduce enrollment in state-administered insurance programs back\n\n        to their baseline levels, the Court would have to enter the same relief. As explained above, that\n\n        sort of remedy falls outside of district court jurisdiction under the CSRA.\n\n               Finally, the States claim they are entitled to specific, advance notice of every probationary\n\n        employee that each federal agency has removed since January 20 or intends to remove. (States\u2019\n\n        Br. at 2, 17-18). They do not have standing to press that claim either. As explained below, the\n\n        States\u2019 claim is without merit; it rests on a misunderstanding of both the facts and the applicable\n\n        statutory and regulatory provisions. But, regardless, \u201cnotice\u201d would not redress the States\u2019 claimed\n\n        injuries-in-fact, which again amount to asserted loss of tax revenue, diversion of resources, and\n\n        increased enrollment in state insurance programs. On this front, there is a basic mismatch between\n\n        the States\u2019 asserted injuries and their supposed right to relief.\n\n               B.      Jurisdiction over the Claims Asserted by the States is Channeled Away from\n                       Federal District Courts under the CSRA and FSL-MRS.\n\n               Relatedly, the States cannot show that the claims they assert would fall within this Court\u2019s\n\n        jurisdiction given how comprehensively the CSRA and FSL-MRS govern employment-related\n\n        disputes between federal employees and agencies. Even though they cast their claims in terms of\n\n        direct injury, everything about their claims, and the remedies they seek, derives from the\n\n        relationship between the federal government and its employees, to which they are strangers. The\n\n        States cannot step into the shoes of those employees and assert claims against federal agencies that\n\n        the employees themselves cannot assert in federal district court, but must instead pursue before\n\n        the FLRA or the MSPB.\n\n                                                          15\n\n                                                     ADD.132\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248    Doc: 8     Filed: 03/17/2025 Pg: 160 of 171\n             Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document 20 Filed 03/10/25 Page 18 of 29\n\n\n\n               And there is no question that these claims cannot be asserted in district court, by employees\n\n        or anyone else. Under the familiar test for implied statutory preclusion under Thunder Basin v.\n\n        Coal Co. v. Reich, 510 U.S. 200 (1994), a claim will be found to fall outside the scope of a special\n\n        statutory review scheme \u201conly in limited circumstances: when (1) a finding of preclusion might\n\n        foreclose all meaningful judicial review; (2) the claim is wholly collateral to the statutory review\n\n        provisions; and (3) the claim is beyond the expertise of the agency.\u201d NTEU, 2005 WL 561080 at\n\n        *5 (cleaned up). Since Thunder Basin, the Supreme Court and the D.C. Circuit have both held\n\n        federal employment or labor challenges to be exclusively channeled away from district court\n\n        review under both the CSRA and the FSL-MRS. See Elgin, 567 U.S. at 13 (CSRA review is\n\n        \u201cexclusive, even for employees who bring constitutional challenges to federal statutes\u201d); Am.\n\n        Fed\u2019n of Gov\u2019t Emps. v. Trump, 929 F.3d 748, 752 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (\u201cAFGE v. Trump\u201d).\n\n               Again, the district court\u2019s recent decision in NTEU is especially instructive. The court\n\n        there held that the union plaintiffs could not sue in district court to challenge these very same\n\n        actions, but must instead pursue relief through the FLRA. 2005 WL 561080 at **5-8. Further, in\n\n        addressing the unions\u2019 argument that pursuing redress before the FLRA (and from there to a court\n\n        of appeals) would be less efficient than doing so before a district court, the court emphasized that\n\n        NTEU \u201cprovides no reason why it could not seek relief from the FLRA on behalf of a class of\n\n        plaintiffs and admits that it would ask other agencies to follow an administrative judge\u2019s ruling in\n\n        its favor.\u201d Id. at *7. In rejecting a challenge to OPM\u2019s \u201cFork in the Road\u201d deferred resignation\n\n        program last month, the federal district court similarly held that the FSL-MRS precluded\n\n        jurisdiction. Am. Fed. of Gov\u2019t Emps., AFL-CIO v. Ezell, No. 25-cv-10276, 2025 WL 470459, at\n\n        *2 (D. Mass.

But any\n\n        such argument would be unavailing for the same reasons already recognized by the court in NTEU.\n\n               Specifically, Congress has broadly empowered the judiciary to hear \u201cclaims \u2018arising under\u2019\n\n        federal law\u201d \u201cby way of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331\u2019s grant of jurisdiction.\u201d Axon, 598 U.S. at 185.\n\n        Nonetheless, \u201c[a] special statutory review scheme, . . . may preclude district courts from exercising\n\n        jurisdiction over challenges to federal agency action.\u201d Id. Where Congress has done so implicitly,\n\n        courts determine whether it intended to preclude particular claims by assessing whether \u201c(i) such\n\n        intent is \u2018fairly discernible in the statutory scheme,\u2019 and (ii) the litigant\u2019s claims are \u2018of the type\n\n        Congress intended to be reviewed within [the] statutory structure.\u2019\u201d Jarkesy v. SEC, 803 F.3d 9,\n\n        15 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (quoting Thunder Basin, 510 U.S. at 207, 212).\n\n               The first step under Thunder Basin\u2014Congress\u2019s intent to preclude\u2014is plainly satisfied\n\n        here: Congress established a detailed statutory scheme for adjudicating federal employment and\n\n        labor disputes. The CSRA sets forth a process for covered employees to appeal removal decisions\n\n        first to the MSPB, with judicial review available before the Federal Circuit following a final\n\n        decision from the MSPB. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(9). And probationers may similarly challenge their\n\n        removals through at least two pathways: via complaint to the Office of Special Counsel or, in more\n\n        limited instances, direct appeal to the MSPB. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(a)(2)(A)(i)\u2013(xii).\n\n\n\n\n        7\n          Plaintiffs discuss the Northern District of California\u2019s decision in AFGE. But they do not\n        acknowledge that the AFGE court rejected the union plaintiffs\u2019 claims as they were channeled\n        exclusively through the FLRA; instead, the court rested its assertion of subject-matter jurisdiction\n        solely on the non-union, non-employee organizational plaintiffs. Defendants address that aspect\n        of the district court\u2019s oral TRO ruling infra.\n                                                          17\n\n                                                     ADD.134\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248    Doc: 8     Filed: 03/17/2025 Pg: 162 of 171\n             Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document 20 Filed 03/10/25 Page 20 of 29\n\n\n\n               Likewise, the FSL-MRS provides for \u201cadministrative and judicial review\u201d regarding\n\n        disputes between federal-employee unions and the federal government. AFGE, 929 F.3d at 752.\n\n        Congress decided, through the FSL-MRS, that federal labor disputes must first be administratively\n\n        exhausted before the FLRA. Judicial review, if any, is available only in a court of appeals. See id.\n\n        at 752 (citing 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7105, 7123(a), (c)); see also 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(b) (judicial review in\n\n        Federal Circuit or other court of appeals). \u201cCongress typically chooses . . . review in a court of\n\n        appeals following the agency\u2019s own review process\u201d when designing an implicit preclusion\n\n        scheme. Axon, 598 U.S. at 185. That is exactly what this scheme includes. Accordingly, as the\n\n        D.C. Circuit has repeatedly recognized, the FSL-MRS precludes jurisdiction in the district courts\n\n        over federal union disputes. See AFGE v. Trump, 929 F.3d at 754. This \u201cenormously complicated\n\n        and subtle scheme to govern employee relations in the federal sector\u201d does not permit a district\n\n        court runaround. See id. at 755 (quoting AFGE v. Sec\u2019y of the Air Force (\u201cAir Force\u201d), 716 F.3d\n\n        633, 636 (D.C. Cir. 2013)).\n\n               Turning to the second Thunder Basin step\u2014whether particular claims are of the type\n\n        Congress intended to be reviewed in this scheme\u2014the Court must consider \u201cthree considerations\n\n        designed to aid in that inquiry, commonly known now as the Thunder Basin factors.\u201d Id. The\n\n        factors are: (1) \u201ccould precluding district court jurisdiction foreclose all meaningful judicial review\n\n        of the claim\u201d; (2) \u201cis the claim wholly collateral to the statute\u2019s review provisions\u201d; and (3) \u201cis the\n\n        claim outside the agency\u2019s expertise?\u201d Id. (internal quotation marks, citation, and alteration\n\n        omitted). These \u201cconsiderations\u201d are ultimately merely guideposts to \u201cbest [] understand what\n\n        Congress has done\u2014whether the statutory review scheme, though exclusive where it applies,\n\n        reaches the claim in question.\u201d Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                                          18\n\n                                                     ADD.135\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248    Doc: 8     Filed: 03/17/2025 Pg: 163 of 171\n             Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document 20 Filed 03/10/25 Page 21 of 29\n\n\n\n               All three Thunder Basin factors are satisfied here. First, the CSRA and FSL-MRS schemes\n\n        provide for meaningful judicial review over the very claims asserted by the States, even if the\n\n        States themselves are not the proper parties to assert them. See AFGE, 929 F.3d at 755. Here, as\n\n        in AFGE v. Trump, federal unions can challenge probationary removals or RIFs through the\n\n        administrative process \u201cin the context of concrete . . . disputes.\u201d Id. at 757; NTEU, 2025 WL\n\n        561080 at *7. Similarly, if any affected party thinks that the probationary removals or RIFs\n\n        conflict with any federal rule, guidance, or statute, it may assert that within the administrative\n\n        scheme. See, e.g., Marshall v. HHS, 587 F.3d 1310, 1318 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (reversing based on an\n\n        erroneous statutory interpretation); Lyons v. VA, 273 F. App\u2019x 929, 931 (Fed. Cir. 2008)\n\n        (considering whether a regulation was violated); Fed. L. Enf\u2019t Officers Ass\u2019n v. Ahuja (\u201cFLEOA\u201d),\n\n        62 F.4th 551, 560 (D.C. Cir. 2023) (noting challenges to OPM guidance through the MSPB\n\n        system).\n\n               Second, the asserted claims are not wholly collateral. The Court must \u201cexamine whether\n\n        the action \u2018at bottom\u2019 seeks a substantive determination that falls within the statutory regime\u2019s\n\n        exclusive scope.\u201d FLEOA, 62 F.4th at 563 (D.C. Cir. 2023) (quoting Heckler v. Ringer, 466 U.S.\n\n        602, 615 (1984)). As the Supreme Court recently explained, a claim may be sufficiently collateral\n\n        when the \u201cclaims do not relate to the subject of the [administrative] actions.\u201d Axon, 598 U.S. at\n\n        193. There, the Court noted that \u201cseparation-of-powers claims\u201d brought against the administrative\n\n        agency were entirely unrelated to the \u201cauditing practices,\u201d and \u201cbusiness merger\u201d that constituted\n\n        the subject matter of the agency actions. See id. Nor were they related to the \u201cprocedural or\n\n        evidentiary matters an agency often resolves on its way to a merits decision.\u201d Id. No such\n\n        separation exists here. Much like the union plaintiffs in NTEU, the States challenge certain\n\n\n\n\n                                                       19\n\n                                                   ADD.136\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248    Doc: 8     Filed: 03/17/2025 Pg: 164 of 171\n             Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document 20 Filed 03/10/25 Page 22 of 29\n\n\n\n        probationary removals and ongoing (and future) RIFs. But those are all the kinds of federal\n\n        personnel and labor issues that lie at the heart of the CSRA and the FSL-MRS.\n\n               Third, and for similar reasons, the MSPB and FLRA may bring respective expertise to bear\n\n        on many of the questions raised. Indeed, Elgin directly addresses the point in the CSRA context.\n\n        As the Court noted: \u201cpreliminary questions unique to the employment context\u201d include fact\n\n        questions about a \u201cresignation\u201d (there whether it \u201camounted to a constructive discharge\u201d) as well\n\n        as \u201cstatutory or constitutional claims that the MSPB routinely considers.\u201d See Elgin, 567 U.S. at\n\n        22\u201323. Even if some of the claims could move beyond the administrative expertise of the FLRA,\n\n        these \u201cthreshold questions\u201d may \u201calleviate [the other] concerns.\u201d See id.\n\n               Again, the States have said nothing so far about Thunder Basin, Elgin, AFGE v. Trump, or\n\n        NTEU, or about why they can assert claims in district court substantively identical to those held to\n\n        be jurisdictionally precluded from district court review when asserted directly by federal\n\n        employees themselves or the unions that represent them. But it would be an odd result if claims\n\n        that cannot be raised in district court by the plaintiffs most directly affected by the challenged\n\n        actions could be raised by States whose asserted injuries are entirely derivative of such plaintiffs.\n\n        And to Defendants\u2019 knowledge, no court has countenanced the States\u2019 argument here.\n\n               The most the States might be able to say on this point\u2014and all they have said\u2014is that the\n\n        district court in AFGE v. Ezell issued a limited TRO against OPM on the basis of similar claims\n\n        asserted by non-employee organizational plaintiffs. But that does not help the States here. The\n\n        States acknowledge that since AFGE, OPM has clarified that the agency \u201cis not directing agencies\n\n        to take any specific performance-based actions regarding probationary employees.\u201d States\u2019 Br. at\n\n        12. And the AFGE suit relied on an altogether different theory of relief. There, the plaintiffs sued\n\n\n\n\n                                                         20\n\n                                                    ADD.137\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248    Doc: 8     Filed: 03/17/2025 Pg: 165 of 171\n             Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document 20 Filed 03/10/25 Page 23 of 29\n\n\n\n        OPM and its agency head alone. They did not attempt to seek APA review of tens of thousands\n\n        of alleged final agency actions involving 41 federal government defendants.\n\n               C.      The States Have Not Shown that Defendants Acted Contrary to Law.\n\n               Even if the States\u2019 suit were procedurally proper, they have established that Defendants\n\n        took action inconsistent with law. The States fundamentally misunderstand Defendants\u2019 discretion\n\n        to terminate probationers. \u201cCongress . . . saw summary terminations as essential to an effective\n\n        and efficient service, and it has repeatedly acted to preserve agencies\u2019 discretion summarily to\n\n        remove probationary employees.\u201d U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice v. Fed. Labor Relations Authority, 709\n\n        F.2d 724, 730 (D.C. Cir. 1983). And \u201c[i]t has, throughout this time, delegated the task of defining\n\n        and administering the specific probationary term to the President and other officials within the\n\n        Executive Branch.\u201d Id. \u201c[S]econd-guessing of the agency\u2019s decision . . . undermines the scheme\n\n        Congress envisioned . . . .\u201d Id. at 289-90.\n\n               President Trump campaigned on a promise to improve the federal government workforce.\n\n        The recent increase in the number of terminations of probationers is consistent with his\n\n        administration\u2019s pledge to raise standards for federal employment. The States have not cited\n\n        anything requiring a newly elected president to have his administration measure probationers by\n\n        standards set under a previous government. Proposals for heightened standards for probationers\n\n        have long circulated among federal workforce policymakers. During the Bush Administration, for\n\n        example, the MSPB advocated for greater scrutiny of probationers. MSPB, \u201cThe Probationary\n\n        Period: A Critical Assessment Opportunity\u201d (Aug. 2005).8\n\n\n\n\n        8\n         https://www.mspb.gov/studies/studies/The_Probationary_Period_A_Critical_Assessment_Oppo\n        rtunity_224555.pdf.\n                                                        21\n\n                                                      ADD.138\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248    Doc: 8     Filed: 03/17/2025 Pg: 166 of 171\n             Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document 20 Filed 03/10/25 Page 24 of 29\n\n\n\n               The States also fail to explain why an agency could not consider its needs and goals in\n\n        determining whether it will make a probationer an employee.               The agency must use the\n\n        probationary period \u201cto determine the fitness of the employee.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.803(a). At the\n\n        same time, the probationer must \u201cdemonstrate fully his or her qualifications for continued\n\n        employment.\u201d Any fitness inquiry necessarily requires some consideration of the role that the\n\n        probationer is seeking. An agency\u2019s needs and goals for specific roles can change during a\n\n        probationary period\u2014especially during any intervening change in leadership. To the extent\n\n        Defendants considered their needs in terminating probationers, that was permissible.\n\n               The States also wrongly suggest that Defendants issued defective notices to terminated\n\n        probationers. An OPM regulation obligates agencies to tell a terminated probationer \u201cwhy he is\n\n        being separated.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.804(a). The States suggest this requires a \u201cparticularized\n\n        assessment of performance or conduct.\u201d States\u2019 Br. at 18. But no statute or regulation requires\n\n        that. Instead, the regulation clarifies that an agency satisfies its notice obligation by stating its\n\n        termination conclusion: \u201cThe information in the notice as to why the employee is being terminated\n\n        shall, at a minimum, consist of the agency\u2019s conclusions as to the inadequacies of his performance\n\n        or conduct.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.804(a). A statement that a probationer has been terminated because\n\n        of his or her performance during the probationary period is sufficient.\n\n               Finally, the States cast doubt on Defendants\u2019 terminations of probationers by calling them\n\n        reductions in force (RIFs). Based on that same premise, the States argue that Defendants violated\n\n        requirements that agencies undertaking certain RIF proceedings must timely notify states or state\n\n        entities designated to carry out rapid response activities under the Workforce Investment Act of\n\n        1998. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d)(3)(A)(i); 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.803. But the premise is mistaken; the States\n\n        ignore fundamental differences between a RIF and the termination of a probationer. The actions\n\n\n\n                                                         22\n\n                                                    ADD.139\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248    Doc: 8     Filed: 03/17/2025 Pg: 167 of 171\n             Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document 20 Filed 03/10/25 Page 25 of 29\n\n\n\n        they challenge here are the latter, not the former. Separately, agencies have begun to implement\n\n        the President\u2019s directive to consider and undertake RIFs, but there is no allegation in the States\u2019\n\n        briefing that any agency has failed to comply with RIF requirements in connection with those\n\n        distinct actions. Importantly, RIFs and probationary terminations are different things. Agencies\n\n        cannot replace employees terminated as part of a RIF; the position is eliminated. But a terminated\n\n        probationer can be replaced.\n\n               The States also imply that OPM\u2019s circulation of a template for the termination of\n\n        probationers converted those terminations into a RIF. Not so. If anything, that template shows\n\n        that OPM did not direct Defendants to implement a RIF. Consistent with the probationer\n\n        termination notice regulation, that template suggested as model language: \u201cThe Agency finds,\n\n        based on your performance, that you have not demonstrated that your further employment at the\n\n        Agency would be in the public interest.\u201d See TRO Mot. at 10. That rationale belies the States\u2019\n\n        mischaracterization of probationer terminations as a reduction in force.9\n\n               II.     The States Cannot Show Irreparable Harm.\n\n               The States assert irreparable harm based on an increased demand for services they already\n\n        provide. That does not suffice. The States have not asserted \u201can invasion of a legally protected\n\n        interest,\u201d Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992), that is, an injury \u201ctraditionally\n\n        redressable in federal court,\u201d United States v. Texas, 599 U.S. 670, 676 (2023). The States do not\n\n        claim that the firings of probationers cause them direct injury by, for example, requiring them to\n\n        act or refrain from acting, determining their federal funding, or depriving them of a legal right. Cf.\n\n\n\n        9\n          The States also seek relief that goes beyond Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(b)\u2019s authority to\n        \u201cissue a temporary restraining order.\u201d A \u201crestraint\u201d is a \u201c[p]rohibition of action; holding back.\u201d\n        Restraint, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (12th ed. 2024). The States\u2019 request for an order reinstating\n        thousands of probationers to their roles is the opposite, a mandatory injunction. See Northeast\n        Ohio Coal. for Homeless & Serv. Emps. v. Blackwell, 467 F.3d 999, 1006 (6th Cir. 2006).\n                                                         23\n\n                                                     ADD.140\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248    Doc: 8     Filed: 03/17/2025 Pg: 168 of 171\n             Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document 20 Filed 03/10/25 Page 26 of 29\n\n\n\n        Biden v. Nebraska, 143 S. Ct. 2355, 2366 (2023) (\u201cThe Secretary\u2019s plan will cut \u2026 revenues,\u201d\n\n        which is \u201cnecessarily a direct injury.\u201d). Rather, they contend that the firings have the incidental\n\n        effect of increasing the States\u2019 burden to provide services. States\u2019 Br. at 16-17. That is the same\n\n        theory advanced and rejected in Texas. Compare States\u2019 Br. at 12 with Texas, 599 U.S. at 674, 680\n\n        n.3 (citing Massachusetts v. Laird, 400 U.S. 886 (1970); Florida v. Mellon, 273 U.S. 12, 16-18\n\n        (1927)). Moreover, while the States focus on the number of probationers fired, the reality is that\n\n        any firing of a federal employee will only \u201cimpose[] peripheral costs on a State.\u201d Arizona v. Biden,\n\n        40 F.4th 375, 386 (6th Cir. 2022). If those downstream costs are sufficient to state a cognizable\n\n        injury, \u201cwhat limits on state standing remain?\u201d Id.\n\n               It cannot be that a federal employment action that increased\u2014or decreased\u2014a State\u2019s\n\n        unemployment obligations and thus affected social-services spending or tax revenue could be\n\n        challenged in federal court. It would mean that Justice Douglas was correct in Laird and that a\n\n        State can sue to enjoin military action if it would result in lost tax revenue or other indirect costs.\n\n        See 400 U.S. at 887-91 (Douglas, J., dissenting); see also id. at 886 (summarily rejecting suit to\n\n        enjoin Vietnam War).\n\n               In short, just as the States lack standing, they also lack cognizable irreparable harm.\n\n               III.    The Public Interest Weighs Against Temporary Relief.\n\n               Turning to the third and fourth factors governing issuance of temporary injunctive relief,\n\n        the States cannot establish that the balance of equities and the public interest favor granting the\n\n        extraordinary remedy of a TRO. These final two factors merge in cases where relief is sought\n\n        from the government. Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009). A TRO would be especially\n\n        harmful to Defendants because probationary periods are time limited. For probationers whose\n\n        probationary periods end during a TRO, Defendants may be unable to later exercise their authority\n\n\n\n                                                          24\n\n                                                     ADD.141\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248    Doc: 8     Filed: 03/17/2025 Pg: 169 of 171\n             Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document 20 Filed 03/10/25 Page 27 of 29\n\n\n\n        to determine that the probationer is not fit for federal employment. In addition, the States\u2019\n\n        requested TRO would interfere with the President\u2019s ability to manage, shape, and streamline the\n\n        federal workforce to more closely reflect policy preferences and the needs of the American public.\n\n               A temporary restraining order would also impose significant and unrecoverable costs on\n\n        Defendants. The relief sought by the States would require the federal government to pay salaries\n\n        and benefits for persons who it otherwise would not be obligated to pay. These expenses are likely\n\n        unrecoverable from terminated probationers even if Defendants ultimately prevail in this action.\n\n        Defendants thus request that any relief be accompanied by a bond under Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(c),\n\n        which provides that \u201c[t]he court may issue a preliminary injunction or a temporary restraining\n\n        order only if the movant gives security in an amount that the court considers proper to pay the\n\n        costs and damages sustained by any party found to have been wrongfully enjoined or restrained.\u201d\n\n        A bond is appropriate here given that any preliminary relief would potentially mandate that the\n\n        Executive spend money that may not be recouped once distributed.10\n\n               IV.     Any Relief Should Preserve the Executive\u2019s Discretionary Authority.\n\n               To the extent the Court considers entering the States\u2019 proposed request for relief, any order\n\n        should be limited to mitigate (albeit not eliminate) the significant harms it would cause to the\n\n        Executive\u2019s abilities to exercise its lawful statutory authority and discretion. To that end,\n\n        Defendants respectfully request that any preliminary relief clarify that it does not prohibit the\n\n        President from reissuing a different directive and/or Executive Order or limit the defendant\n\n\n\n\n        10\n           Indeed, the States seek relief that exceeds Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(b)\u2019s authority to\n        \u201cissue a temporary restraining order.\u201d A \u201crestraint\u201d is a \u201c[p]rohibition of action; holding back.\u201d\n        Restraint, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (12th ed. 2024).

That is the normal equitable remedy, and anything broader would constitute a\n\n        significant intrusion on the separation of powers. Ancient Coin Collectors Guild v.

The Requirements are\n       available as a link from this order and at www.ca4.uscourts.gov. FRAP 28,\n       30 & 32. NOTE: The Court\u2019s preferred typefaces are Times New\n       Roman, Century Schoolbook, and Georgia.

Appendix citations in the parties' briefs must use the\n       same format. Local Rules 28(g) & 30(b)(4).\n   \u2022   All parties to a side must join in a single brief, even in consolidated cases,\n       unless the court has granted a motion for leave to file separate briefs.

In such a case, the reason for scheduling the\n    conference will be kept confidential. Local Rule 33.\n\u2022   The court may, on its own initiative and without prior notice, screen an\n    appeal for decision on the parties' briefs without oral argument. Local Rule\n    34(a).\n\u2022   If a case is to be scheduled for argument, counsel will receive prior notice\n    from the court.\n\n                                /s/ NWAMAKA ANOWI, CLERK\n                                By: Jeffrey S.
