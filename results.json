Plaintiffs allege that the\n\n        Government violated federal law when it terminated thousands of probationary federal\n\n        employees without following the procedures required for a reduction in force, including\n\n        advance notice to the affected States. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502; 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.803(b). The\n\n        district court agreed with Plaintiffs and entered a preliminary injunction requiring the\n\n        Government to reinstate the probationary employees who reside or work in Plaintiff States\n\n        and refrain from further alleged reductions in force except in compliance with the notice\n\n        requirements of \u00a7 3502. Maryland v. USDA, --- F. Supp. 3d ---, 2025 WL 973159, at *40-\n\n        42 (D. Md. April 1, 2025).\n\n              The Government now asks us to stay the district court\u2019s preliminary injunction.\n\n        Among other things, the Government argues that the States lack Article III standing to\n\n        challenge the terminations and that the district court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction\n\n        because the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, Pub. L. No. 95-454, provides the exclusive\n\n        means for review of personnel actions taken against federal employees.\n\n              Having reviewed the record, the district court\u2019s opinion, and the parties\u2019 briefing,\n\n        we agree with the Government that it has satisfied the factors for a stay under Nken v.\n                                                   4\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248    Doc: 42           Filed: 04/09/2025 Pg: 5 of 12\n             Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB        Document 139 Filed 04/09/25           Page 5 of 12\n\n\n\n        Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 426 (2009). The Government is likely to succeed in showing the\n\n        district court lacked jurisdiction over Plaintiffs\u2019 claims, and the Government is unlikely to\n\n        recover the funds disbursed to reinstated probationary employees. Cf. Dep\u2019t of Educ. v.\n\n        California, No. 24A910, 2025 WL 1008354, at *1 (U.S. Apr. 4, 2025) (per curiam). The\n\n        Supreme Court has stayed a similar preliminary injunction issued by the United States\n\n        District Court for the Northern District of California. See OPM v. AFGE, No. 24A904,\n\n        2025 WL 1035208, at *1 (U.S. Apr. 8, 2025) (mem.). We therefore grant the Government\u2019s\n\n        motion for a stay of the preliminary injunction pending this appeal. The Clerk will set an\n\n        expedited briefing schedule.\n\n               Entered at the direction of Judge Rushing, with the concurrence of Judge Wilkinson.\n\n        Judge Benjamin filed a separate dissenting opinion.\n\n                                                          For the Court\n\n                                                          /s/ Nwamaka Anowi, Clerk\n\n\n\n\n                                                     5\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248    Doc: 42            Filed: 04/09/2025 Pg: 6 of 12\n             Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB         Document 139 Filed 04/09/25           Page 6 of 12\n\n\n\n        DEANDREA GIST BENJAMIN, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n\n               The majority votes to stay the preliminary injunction pending the resolution of the\n\n        appeal. The district court entered a well-reasoned memorandum opinion and order granting\n\n        a preliminary injunction, and then denied a motion for stay pending appeal. For the below\n\n        reasons and those explained in thorough detail by the district court, I would deny the\n\n        Government\u2019s motion.\n\n\n\n                                                      I.\n\n                                                      A.\n\n               As a threshold matter, per the district court\u2019s order, the States1 clearly have standing\n\n        to challenge the process by which the Government has engaged in mass firings.2 To\n\n        establish standing, \u201cthe plaintiff must have a \u2018 \u201cpersonal stake\u201d \u2019 in the case.\u201d TransUnion\n\n        LLC v. Ramirez, 594 U.S. 413, 423 (2021) (quoting Raines v. Byrd, 521 U.S. 811, 819\n\n        (1997)). To prove a personal stake, \u201cplaintiffs must be able to sufficiently answer the\n\n        question: \u2018 \u201cWhat\u2019s it to you?\u201d \u2019 \u201d Id. (quoting Antonin Scalia, The Doctrine of Standing\n\n\n               1\n                Plaintiff States are a consortium of nineteen states (Maryland, Minnesota, Arizona,\n        California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan,\n        Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont,\n        Wisconsin) and the District of Columbia.\n               2\n                 This is an important distinction. The Government repeatedly mischaracterizes the\n        basis of the States\u2019 claims, suggesting that the States are attempting to sue on behalf of\n        their respective citizens for alleged unlawful firings. This mischaracterization not only\n        misses the point but\u2014more seriously\u2014distracts from the States\u2019 actual alleged harm. The\n        States were entitled to proper notice, which the Government did not give. That is the basis\n        for the instant suit.\n\n                                                      6\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248    Doc: 42            Filed: 04/09/2025 Pg: 7 of 12\n             Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB         Document 139 Filed 04/09/25           Page 7 of 12\n\n\n\n        as an Essential Element of the Separation of Powers, 17 Suffolk U. L. Rev. 881, 882\n\n        (1983)). A satisfactory answer to this question requires a plaintiff to show \u201c(i) that he\n\n        suffered an injury in fact that is concrete, particularized, and actual or imminent; (ii) that\n\n        the injury was likely caused by the defendant; and (iii) that the injury would likely be\n\n        redressed by judicial relief.\u201d Id. (citing Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560\u2013\n\n        61 (1992)).\n\n               The Supreme Court has recognized that certain intangible injuries, including an\n\n        \u201cinformational injury,\u201d can support standing. See, e.g., Fed. Election Comm\u2019n v. Akins,\n\n        524 U.S. 11, 24\u201325 (1998); Pub. Citizen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 491 U.S. 440, 449 (1989).\n\n        \u201cA statutory violation alone,\u201d however, \u201cdoes not create a concrete informational injury\n\n        sufficient to support standing.\u201d Dreher v. Experian Info. Sols., Inc., 856 F.3d 337, 345 (4th\n\n        Cir. 2017) (citing Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 578 U.S. 330, 341\u201342 (2016)). Instead, a\n\n        \u201cconstitutionally cognizable informational injury requires that a person lack access to\n\n        information to which he is legally entitled and that the denial of that information creates a\n\n        \u2018real\u2019 harm with an adverse effect.\u201d Id. (quoting Spokeo, 578 U.S. at 339\u201340).\n\n               By this standard, the States\u2019 informational injury cannot be a \u201cdead end,\u201d as the\n\n        Government claims. See Mot. for stay pending appeal at 1. First, pursuant to 5 U.S.C.\n\n        \u00a7 3502(d), the Government was legally required to inform the States at least 60 days before\n\n        any reduction in force (\u201cRIF\u201d). See also 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.803(b). The Government failed\n\n        to do so, thereby depriving the States of information to which they were legally entitled\n\n        and satisfying the first requirement of a constitutionally cognizable informational injury.\n\n        See Dreher, 856 F.3d at 345. Next, as discussed in depth by the district court, the denial\n                                                  7\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248    Doc: 42           Filed: 04/09/2025 Pg: 8 of 12\n             Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB        Document 139 Filed 04/09/25         Page 8 of 12\n\n\n\n        of this notice has, and will continue to, cause real harm with significant adverse effects.\n\n        See Mem. Op. on prelim. inj. (D. ECF No. 125) at 10\u201316.3 Such adverse effects include,\n\n        but are not limited to, an increase in unemployment benefits applications, an increase in\n\n        the resources required to investigate this influx in unemployment benefits applications,\n\n        additional financial and labor costs associated with the sudden strain placed on rapid\n\n        response programs without advance notice, unanticipated loss of tax revenue, and the loss\n\n        of support from federal employees who were working with various state agencies.4 See id.\n\n        These harms, among others, plainly satisfy the concreteness requirement and thus provide\n\n        the necessary grounds for Article III standing. See Dreher, 856 F.3d at 345.\n\n               Further, the district court correctly distinguished this case from United States v.\n\n        Texas, 599 U.S. 670 (2023). Asking the Government \u201cto change its arrest or prosecution\n\n        policies so that the Executive Branch makes more arrests or initiates more prosecutions\u201d is\n\n        a far cry from requiring the Government to adhere to a statutory notice requirement. See\n\n        id. at 677. The former \u201crun[s] up against the Executive\u2019s Article II authority to enforce\n\n\n\n               3\n                Page numbers for citations to ECF documents utilize the document\u2019s native\n        numbering.\n               4\n                 The Government\u2019s argument regarding the harms suffered by the States as a result\n        of the lack of statutory notice is concerning. See Mot. for stay pending appeal at 13\n        (arguing that allowing standing \u201cbased on downstream harms to state budgets and\n        operations from the termination of probationary employees\u201d is \u201ca recipe for any state to\n        micromanage the activities of the federal government\u201d and \u201cirreconcilable with Supreme\n        Court precedent\u201d). Requiring the federal government to adhere to statutory notice\n        requirements as set forth by federal law can hardly be considered \u201cmicromanaging.\u201d As\n        explained below, the Government had the opportunity to conduct the RIF according to\n        statutory procedure and chose not to do so.\n\n                                                    8\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248    Doc: 42            Filed: 04/09/2025 Pg: 9 of 12\n             Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB         Document 139 Filed 04/09/25           Page 9 of 12\n\n\n\n        federal law\u201d and seeks to mandate something of the Government that was not already\n\n        required. Id. at 678. The latter merely asks the Government to comply with a required\n\n        procedure.\n\n               In the same vein, the relationship between the action (or inaction) by the\n\n        Government and the alleged harm is also distinct. In Texas, the states sought damages for\n\n        the costs associated with incarceration and social services based on the Government\u2019s\n\n        failure to exercise its discretion\u2014i.e., its discretionary inaction. Id. at 674, 684\u201385. Here,\n\n        the alleged harms, namely, the unexpected increased financial burden placed on rapid\n\n        response programs, are a result of the Government\u2019s failure to adhere to statutory notice\n\n        requirements\u2014i.e., its actions contrary to law. One is tangentially related to actions that\n\n        the Government was not required to take, while the other is directly related to an action\n\n        the Government was required to and failed to take. For these reasons, and those aptly\n\n        explained by the district court, Texas is inapplicable here.5\n\n\n\n\n               5\n                 On April 8, 2025, the Supreme Court stayed the preliminary injunction entered by\n        the United States District Court for the Northern District of California in its similar\n        probationary employee RIF case. See OPM v. AFGE, No. 24A904 (U.S. Apr. 8, 2025).\n        The Ninth Circuit had denied a motion to stay pending appeal. See Am. Fed\u2019n of Gov\u2019t\n        Emps., AFL-CIO v. United States Off. of Pers. Mgmt., No. 25-1677, 2025 WL 914823 (9th\n        Cir. Mar. 26, 2025). Like United States v. Texas, 599 U.S. 670 (2023), the decision in\n        AFGE is not applicable to the present case. The Supreme Court specifically noted \u201c[t]he\n        District Court\u2019s injunction was based solely on the allegations of the nine non-profit-\n        organization plaintiffs.\u201d See AFGE, No. 24A904. The basis of standing is different here,\n        where States are suing under a statutory scheme relevant to states.\n\n                                                      9\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 42            Filed: 04/09/2025 Pg: 10 of 12\n            Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB         Document 139 Filed 04/09/25 Page 10 of 12\n\n\n\n               Accordingly, the States have successfully answered the question: \u201cWhat\u2019s it to\n\n        them?\u201d    See TransUnion LLC, 594 U.S. at 423.           Standing based on the alleged\n\n        informational injury is thus appropriate here.\n\n                                                    B.\n\n               Nor does the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (\u201cCSRA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7101\u201335,\n\n        defeat the district court\u2019s jurisdiction. The CSRA \u201cprovides for the original and exclusive\n\n        administrative review of certain labor- and employment-related claims brought by federal\n\n        employees and/or their unions.\u201d Mem. Op. on prelim. inj. at 32. The Government argues\n\n        the CSRA precludes the States\u2019 claims because \u201cat bottom, [they] rest on allegations that\n\n        the government unlawfully terminated probationary employees . . . and the states sought\u2014\n\n        and the district court granted\u2014reinstatement of affected employees.\u201d Mot. for stay\n\n        pending appeal at 21\u201322.\n\n               The States do not dispute that they cannot receive relief under the CSRA\u2014instead,\n\n        they have consistently argued that their harm arises from an independent \u201cstatutory right[]\n\n        to notice.\u201d Mem. in support of motion for prelim. inj. (D. ECF No. 78-1) at 15. I, like the\n\n        district court, am not prepared to accept \u201cthe faulty premise that the States [are] simply\n\n        trying to vindicate the interests of the terminated workers (as opposed to their own and\n\n        separate harms as \u2018state qua states\u2019).\u201d Mem. Op. on prelim. inj. at 33.\n\n               I also cannot ignore the Supreme Court\u2019s analytical framework for assessing\n\n        whether a district court is divested of jurisdiction in favor of the Government\u2019s preferred\n\n        framework. As ably set out by the district court, \u201cpursuant to . . . Thunder Basin Coal Co.\n\n        v. Reich, 510 U.S. 200 (1994), there [is] no reason to believe Congress ha[s] divested the\n                                                    10\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 42             Filed: 04/09/2025 Pg: 11 of 12\n            Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 139 Filed 04/09/25 Page 11 of 12\n\n\n\n        district courts of jurisdiction over the States\u2019 claims in this case.\u201d Mem. Op. on prelim.\n\n        inj. at 31; see also id. at 31\u201333. The Government\u2019s attempt to review the jurisdictional\n\n        question pursuant to Block v. Community Nutrition Institute, 467 U.S. 340 (1984) is\n\n        unavailing and \u201crel[ies] crucially on the idea that there is an identity of interests between\n\n        the States and the fired employees.\u201d Id. at 37; see also id. at 35\u201337. \u201cBut,\u201d as the district\n\n        court made clear, \u201cthat is not so.\u201d Id. at 37.\n\n               For the above reasons, I do not believe the Government can defeat the States\u2019\n\n        standing.\n\n\n\n                                                         II.\n\n               The Government also cannot satisfy the standard for a stay pending appeal. Those\n\n        factors are \u201c(1) whether the stay applicant has made a strong showing that he is likely to\n\n        succeed on the merits; (2) whether the applicant will be irreparably injured absent a stay;\n\n        (3) whether issuance of the stay will substantially injure the other parties interested in the\n\n        proceeding; and (4) where the public interest lies.\u201d Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 434\n\n        (2009) (quoting Hilton v. Braunskill, 481 U.S. 770, 776 (1987)).\n\n               The Government must satisfy all four factors. But I do not believe it can satisfy\n\n        any. I write to highlight the Government\u2019s lack of a convincing argument on irreparable\n\n        harm. See Nken, 556 U.S. at 434\u201335 (2009). The Government asserts that it cannot recover\n\n        salaries it is currently paying to reinstated probationary employees, and that the preliminary\n\n        injunction is a disruption to the CSRA process. See Mot. for stay pending appeal at 25\u2013\n\n        27.\n                                                         11\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248   Doc: 42            Filed: 04/09/2025 Pg: 12 of 12\n            Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB         Document 139 Filed 04/09/25 Page 12 of 12\n\n\n\n               The Government\u2019s monetary injury, if any, is \u201c \u2018self-imposed.\u2019 \u201d See Dep\u2019t of Educ.\n\n        v. California, __ S. Ct. __, __, No. 24A910, 2025 WL 1008354, at *1 (quoting Cuomo v.\n\n        U.S. Nuclear Regul. Comm\u2019n, 772 F.2d 972, 977 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (per curiam)). The\n\n        preliminary injunction order expressly states \u201c[n]othing in this Order prohibits the\n\n        Government from conducting lawful terminations of probationary federal employees\u2014\n\n        whether (1) pursuant to a proper RIF . . . or else (2) for cause . . . under the standards for\n\n        making such determinations set forth in the TRO Memorandum.\u201d Prelim. Inj. order (D.\n\n        ECF No. 126) at 2 n.1. Additionally, if the Government had followed the statutory RIF\n\n        notice procedure, it would have had to pay probationary employees\u2019 salaries for a statutory\n\n        period anyway. See 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.801. And, as explained earlier, the States are not\n\n        alleging a violation of the CSRA, nor are they attempting to step into the probationary\n\n        employees\u2019 place for a CSRA challenge. See Mem. Op. on prelim. inj. at 33\u201337.\n\n\n\n                                                     III.\n\n               I see no reason to stay the district court\u2019s preliminary injunction pending its appeal.\n\n        For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n                                                     12\n\f",

See Dkt Nos. 126, \u00b6 4. Specifically, the Declaration of\n\nJessica Parton, on behalf of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) (see Dkt. No. 136-1, pp.\n\n27-29), incorrectly states that OPM had 47 Affected Probationary Employees (and had reinstated\n\nall 47 of those individuals). See id. at \u00b6\u00b6 3, 6, 8. The declaration should have stated that OPM had\n\n46 Affected Probationary Employees (and had reinstated all 46 of these individuals). Accordingly,\n\nDefendants respectfully request that the Court replace the Declaration of Jessica Parton (Dkt. No.\n\n136-1, pp. 27-29), with the attached Corrected Declaration of Jessica M.

PARTON\n\n           Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I, Jessica M. Parton declare as follows:\n\n\n           1.      I am the Supervisory Human Resources Specialist headquartered in Washington,\n\nDC. I make this declaration based on my own personal knowledge, on information contained in\n\nthe records of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), or on information provided to me\n\nby OPM employees.\n\n           2.      I have served in this position since June 10, 2018. In my role at OPM, I am\n\nresponsible for personnel management. I have the responsibility for overseeing the personnel\n\nenterprise and tracking and recording of personnel actions, including terminations. I assist in\n\nensuring that all personnel actions comply with federal law, including those related to probationary\n\nemployees.\n\n           3.      As of Tuesday, April 8, 2025, OPM had forty-six (46) Affected Probationary\n\nEmployees, as defined in paragraph 8(b) of the Preliminary Injunction Order. As of that date,\n\nOPM had reinstated forty-six (46) Affected Probationary Employees.\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 137-1       Filed 04/08/25      Page 2 of 3\n\n\n\n       4.      As of Tuesday, April 8, 2025, OPM communicated Affected Probationary\n\nEmployees\u2019 reinstatement status to each by personal email. One (1) of the emails was returned as\n\nundeliverable, and we are contacting the employee to obtain a valid email address.\n\n       5.      OPM has cancelled all termination personnel actions for all Affected Probationary\n\nEmployees, and all have been placed on paid administrative leave. All Affected Probationary\n\nEmployees have been restored without physical and system (IT) access. We are coordinating\n\nclosely with the payroll office to reconcile Affected Probationary Employees\u2019 annual leave and\n\nintend to offset previously made annual leave payouts with the administrative leave pay to prevent\n\nor limit indebtedness. Leave will be recredited to Affected Probationary Employees\u2019 accounts. All\n\nAffected Probationary Employees have been reinstated to the benefits they were enrolled in prior\n\nto termination, ensuring no break in service. No action is required on the part of Affected\n\nProbationary Employees with respect to benefits. It may take the carriers a few weeks to\n\nappropriately update their systems.\n\n       6.      Forty-six (46) termination personnel actions have been cancelled.\n\n       7.      To date, no Affected Probationary Employee has informed us that they decline\n\nreinstatement. If an Affected Probationary Employee does inform us of a desire to decline\n\nreinstatement on the basis that they now have outside employment that could conflict with Federal\n\nemployment under applicable ethics rules, we will consult with our Office of the General Counsel\n\nto present the Affected Probationary Employee with available options.\n\n       8.      Two of the forty-six (46) Affected Probationary Employees were reinstated to\n\noffices that were subject to a Reduction in Force (RIF). Because the Affected Probationary\n\nEmployees were in the RIF competitive areas and would have been released in the RIFs, we\n\nreinstated those employees and will be issuing them the required RIF notices. They will remain in\n\n\n\n                                                    2\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB         Document 137-1        Filed 04/08/25      Page 3 of 3\n\n\n\na paid administrative leave status pending release at the end of the notice period. Neither of the\n\nRIFs at issue involves competitive areas of fifty (50) or more employees, thus the 5 C.F.R.\n\n351.803(b) notice requirement with respect to states does not apply.\n\n       9.      The Deferred Resignation Program (DRP) has reopened for all employees at OPM\n\nthrough April 14, 2025. With the exception of the two employees described in paragraph eight (8),\n\nwe have offered all Affected Probationary Employees the opportunity to opt into the DRP program\n\nif they so choose.\n\nPursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and\ncorrect.\n                                                            Dated: April 8, 2025\n\n\n                                                            /s/ Jessica M.

I make this Declaration based on my own\npersonal knowledge, on information contained in the records of USDA, or on information provided\nto me by USDA employees. | have served in this position since January 31, 2025, and I have been\nemployed at USDA since 2018. I submitted previous declarations in this matter and rely on and\nincorporate my prior declaration testimony in making this declaration.\n\n2. In my role at USDA, | currently oversee the Department\u2019s Office of Human\nResources Management and | have purview over USDA subagencies\u2019 Chief Operating Officers\nand Human Resources Offices.\n\n3, USDA reinstated and notified the Affected Probationary Employees to the pay\n\nstatus they were in prior to their terminations. The Affected Probationary Employees who are in\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document136-1 Filed 04/08/25 Page 3 of 29\n\npay status were initially placed on administrative leave as part of the phased plan to return the\nemployees to work.\n\n4, Given the large number of Affected Probationary Employees being reinstated,\nUSDA is simultaneously developing and implementing enhanced procedures and tracking the\nDepartment\u2019s progress in returning the Affected Probationary Employees to full duty status. For\nexample, USDA administered an electronic survey through which Affected Probationary\nEmployees can indicate whether they elect to return to full duty status or whether they decline to\nreturn to full duty status. As the tracking system is being developed, some of the data is being\ninput manually by Human Resources personnel and reflecting a more comprehensive and detailed\nperspective of this multi-faceted undertaking. USDA is providing this compliance update based\nin part on this dynamic data set. USDA is also using timekeeping data to ascertain which Affected\nProbationary Employees have returned to full duty status (returned to work) and which Affected\nProbationary Employees remain on administrative leave.\n\n5. Approximately 4,633 Affected Probationary Employees have been returned to full\nduty status or have a confirmed date on which they will return to full duty status.\n\n6. Human Resources personnel continue to try to reach all affected employees by\nemail and telephone to confirm their elections regarding the return to full duty status and, for those\nemployees who elect to return to full duty status, to continue to implement USDA\u2019s phased plan\nto return the Affected Probationary Employees to full duty status. The phased plan considers an\nemployee\u2019s need to access, and availability of, information technology and other equipment;\nLincpasses (badges); systems credentials; workstation readiness; and safety and security of\n\nfacilities. USDA is continuously receiving updates and information from the people in the group\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document136-1 Filed 04/08/25 Page 4 of 29\n\nof Affected Probationary Employees, via the survey and other modes of communication, regarding\n\nthe offer to return to full duty status.\n\nPursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true\n\nand correct.\n\nDated: April 8, 2025\n\nDigitally signed by\nMARY RIC MARY RICE\n\nDate: 2025.04.08\n\n13:46:37 -04'00'\nMARY PLETCHER RICE\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document136-1 Filed 04/08/25 Page 5of 29\n\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF MARYLAND\n\nMaryland, et al.,\n\nCase No. 1:25-cy- -\nPlaintiffs, ase No. 1:25-cv-00748-JKB\n\nv.\nUnited States Department of Agriculture,\n\net al.,\n\nDefendants.\n\nDECLARATION OF TIMOTHY D.

I am the Supervisory Human Resources Specialist headquartered in Washington,\nDC. | make this declaration based on my own personal knowledge, on information contained in\nthe records of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), or on information provided to me\nby OPM employees.\n\n2.

I assist in\nensuring that all personnel actions comply with federal law, including those related to probationary\nemployees.\n\n3. As of Tuesday, April 8, 2025, OPM had forty-seven (47) Affected Probationary\nEmployees, as defined in paragraph 8(b) of the Preliminary Injunction Order. As of that date,\n\nOPM had reinstated forty-seven (47) Affected Probationary Employees.\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document136-1 Filed 04/08/25 Page 28 of 29\n\n4, As of Tuesday, April 8, 2025, OPM communicated Affected Probationary\nEmployees\u2019 reinstatement status to each by personal email. One (1) of the emails was returned as\nundeliverable, and we are contacting the employee to obtain a valid email address.\n\n5. OPM has cancelled all termination personnel actions for all Affected Probationary\nEmployees, and all have been placed on paid administrative leave. All Affected Probationary\nEmployees have been restored without physical and system (IT) access. We are coordinating\nclosely with the payroll office to reconcile Affected Probationary Employees\u2019 annual leave and\nintend to offset previously made annual leave payouts with the administrative leave pay to prevent\nor limit indebtedness. Leave will be recredited to Affected Probationary Employees\u2019 accounts. All\nAffected Probationary Employees have been reinstated to the benefits they were enrolled in prior\nto termination, ensuring no break in service. No action is required on the part of Affected\nProbationary Employees with respect to benefits. It may take the carriers a few weeks to\nappropriately update their systems.\n\n6. Forty-seven (47) termination personnel actions have been cancelled.\n\n7. To date, no Affected Probationary Employee has informed us that they decline\nreinstatement. If an Affected Probationary Employee does inform us of a desire to decline\nreinstatement on the basis that they now have outside employment that could conflict with Federal\nemployment under applicable ethics rules, we will consult with our Office of the General Counsel\nto present the Affected Probationary Employee with available options.\n\n8. Two of the forty-seven (47) Affected Probationary Employees were reinstated to\noffices that were subject to a Reduction in Force (RIF). Because the Affected Probationary\nEmployees were in the RIF competitive areas and would have been released in the RIFs, we\n\nreinstated those employees and will be issuing them the required RIF notices. They will remain in\n\nNo\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document136-1 Filed 04/08/25 Page 29 of 29\n\na paid administrative leave status pending release at the end of the notice period. Neither of the\nRIFs at issue involves competitive areas of fifty (50) or more employees, thus the 5 C.F.R.\n351.803(b) notice requirement with respect to states does not apply.\n\n9. The Deferred Resignation Program (DRP) has reopened for all employees at OPM\nthrough April 14, 2025. With the exception of the two employees described in paragraph eight (8),\n\nwe have offered all Affected Probationary Employees the opportunity to opt into the DRP program\n\nif they so choose.\n\nPursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, 1 declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and\n\ncorrect.\n\nDated: April 8, 2025\n\n/s/ Jessica M.

Lombard Street Chambers 5A\n\nBaltimore, MD 21201\nMarch 27, 2025\n~ Subject: Notice of Non-Reinstatement Following Mass Terminations at the Department of\nDefense\nDear Judge Bredar,\n\nI am writing to inform you that I was terminated from my probationary position as an Oversight\nEditor at the Department of the Army\u2019s Office of the Inspector General (DAIG) on Friday,\nFebruary 21, 2025, have yet to be reinstated or placed on administrative leave.\n\nI have received no communication from the DoD, including a notice per your request for names\nof terminated employees who have not been reinstated after the ruling my firing was illegal.\n\nAs one of the highest paid employees in my unit I was terminated using my probationary status\nto illegally achieve the goals of a Reduction-in-Force. My termination letter stated, \u201cthis action is\nin accordance with Title 5, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 315, Subpart H, to promote\n\u201cthe efficiency of service.\u201d >\n\nThe above regulation applies to competitive positions, but my position was in the excepted\nservice. Also, the referenced regulation has no requirement to, \u201cpromote the efficiency of\n\n_ service.\u201d These errors strongly indicate my termination was in no way about performance but\nwas rushed through using a template document provided by the Office of Personnel Management\n(OPM) to follow an illegal diktat from OPM.\n\ni\n\nIn addition to others at DAIG, my termination was part of \u201clight firings\u201d of other probationary\nemployees across the agency that took place at the DoD since Feb 21. I know employees in this\ncategory have been reinstated at DoD and at other agencies at issue in recent weeks.\n\nBased on conversations in the office of my direct employer prior to Feb 21, it was widely\nunderstood that DAIG had been ordered to do a budget reduction of 25% and was scrambling to\ncut its work of probationary employees, of which it has very few.\n\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document135 Filed 04/07/25 Page 2of2\n\n\u201c \u2018am submitting: this. letter considering your recent order regarding lists of terminated employees\n\u201cWiio have not b\u00e9erifeinstated. I would greatly appreciate any assistance in my reinstatement.\n\non\n\nMonon\n\nSinteely,\nMe Ne \u201d\n\ntu :33 Elizabeth R. Smith *\u00a5!\n\n",

JKB-25-0748\n\nUNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF *\nAGRICULTURE, et al.,\n\nDefendants.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nMEMORANDUM AND ORDER\n\nOn April 1, 2025, the Court issued a Preliminary Injunction Order pursuant to Federal Rule\nof Civil Procedure 65 and 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 705 that, inter alia, stayed the Government\u2019s recent\nterminations of federal probationary employees and enjoined the Government from conducting\nfuture reductions in force (\u201cRIFs\u201d) except in accordance with the law. (ECF No. 126.) The\nfollowing day, the Government filed a Notice of Appeal. (ECF No. 127.) The appeal was docketed\nwith the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit under case number 25-1338. (ECF\nNo. 129). The appeal has been consolidated with case number 25-1248 (which pertains to the\nGovernment\u2019s appeal of the Court\u2019s earlier Temporary Restraining Order (\u201cTRO\u201d), ECF No. 44),\nwith case number 25-1248 being the lead case. (ECF No. 130.)\n\nNow pending before the Court is the Government\u2019s Motion to Stay Preliminary Injunction\nPending Appeal (the \u201cMotion to Stay\u201d), which the Government filed yesterday evening, April 3.\n(ECF No. 131.) Today, April 4, the Plaintiff States filed their opposition. (ECF No. 133.) The\nGovernment requests that the Court issue its ruling by 2:00 p.m. (ECF No. 131 at 1.) The Motion\n\nto Stay will be denied.\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document134 Filed 04/04/25 Page2of5\n\nBefore turning to the merits of the Motion to Stay, the Court begins with the question of\njurisdiction. See Whitaker v. Monroe Staffing Servs., LLC, 42 F.4th 200, 206 (4th Cir. 2022). \u201cThe\nfiling of a notice of appeal is an event of jurisdictional significance\u2014it confers jurisdiction on the\ncourt of appeals and divests the district court of its control over those aspects of the case involved\nin the appeal.\u201d Griggs v. Provident Consumer Disc. Co., 459 U.S. 56, 58 (1982). However, this\ngeneral rule has some \u201climited exceptions . . . confined to a narrow class of actions that promote\njudicial efficiency and facilitate the division of labor between trial and appellate courts.\u201d Doe v.\nPub. Citizen, 749 F.3d 246, 258 (2014). One such exception comes in the form of Federal Rule of\nCivil Procedure 62(d), which permits a court to \u201csuspend, modify, restore, or grant an injunction\non terms for bond or other terms that secure the opposing party\u2019s rights\u201d while an interlocutory\nappeal is pending.' This rule authorizes a district court to stay its injunction pending appeal, \u201ceven\nafter notice of the appeal has been filed.\u201d 11 Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal\nPractice & Procedure \u00a7 2904 (3d ed. 2024) (collecting cases).\n\nSatisfied that it has jurisdiction to consider the Motion to Stay, the Court turns to the\nrelevant standards. In its TRO Memorandum, the Court reviewed the standards for staying a ruling\npending appeal:\n\nIn deciding whether to issue a stay pending appeal, the Court considers: (1) whether\n\nthe stay applicant has made a strong showing that he is likely to succeed on the\n\nmerits; (2) whether the applicant will be irreparably injured absent a stay; (3)\n\nwhether issuance of the stay will substantially injure the other parties interested in\n\nthe proceeding; and (4) where the public interest lies.\n\n(ECF No. 43 at 55 (quoting Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 434 (2009).) As the Court explained,\n\nthese overlap with the factors that a court considers in deciding whether to grant a preliminary\n\ninjunction under Winter v. Natural Resources Defense Council, 555 U.S. 7 (2008). As a result,\n\n' The bond requirement is waived when the party seeking the stay is the United States. Fed. R. Civ. P.\n65(e).\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document134 Filed 04/04/25 Page 3of5\n\n\u201cTilt is generally logically inconsistent for a court to issue a... preliminary injunction and then\nstay that order, as the findings on which those decisions are premised are almost perfect opposites.\u201d\n(ECF No. 43 at 55.)\n\nThe Government contends that, in this context, the Court need not change its mind as to\nthe correctness of its prior ruling; it need merely determine whether \u201cthe Defendant\u2019s appeal\npresents an admittedly difficult legal question.\u201d (ECF No. 131-1 at 3 (quoting United States v.\nMosby, Crim. No. LKG-22-00007, 2024 WL 3877613, at *3 (D. Md. Aug. 20, 2024).) The Court\nagrees that this approach makes good sense; otherwise, a district court would never stay an order\npending appeal, as \u201cevery court that renders a judgment does so in the belief that its judgment is\nthe correct one.\u201d Woollard v. Sheridan, 863 F. Supp. 2d 462, 477 (D. Md. 2012), rev'd on other\ngrounds sub nom. Woollard v. Gallagher, 712 F.3d 865 (4th Cir. 2013).\n\nHowever, even under the less demanding \u201cadmittedly difficult legal question\u201d standard,\nthe Government falls short. The Court is well aware, of course, that the questions presented in this\ncase are complex and involve issues of first impression. But in its Motion to Stay, the Government\nsimply rehashes the same arguments that the Court considered in detail and rejected in the\nMemorandum accompanying the Preliminary Injunction Order. (See generally ECF No. 125)\nThe Government does not provide any reason to revisit those conclusions; indeed, the Government\ndoes not even engage with the Court\u2019s analysis in any meaningful way. For example, the\nGovernment contends that \u201cDefendants demonstrated that Plaintiffs\u2019 claimed \u2018statutory right of\nnotice\u2019 alone failed to support an \u2018informational injury\u2019 that suffices as an injury-in-fact for\nstanding.\u201d (ECF No. 131-1 at 3.) The Government seems to ignore the lengthy discussion in the\nCourt\u2019s Preliminary Injunction Memorandum on this exact issue, in which the Court explained\n\nthat it \u201cwould be unwilling to accept\u201d a theory of standing based solely on a violation of a statutory\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document134 Filed 04/04/25 Page4of5\n\nright, and that instead a plaintiff claiming an informational injury must show denial of information\nto which they were entitled plus cognizable downstream harms\u2014a requirement that the Court\nfound the States had amply satisfied. (See ECF No. 125 at 18-25.) The Government\u2019s other\narguments are all in a similar vein, repeating arguments that the Court has already considered (in\nmany cases, twice, at both the TRO and Preliminary Injunction stages), without even cursorily\npointing out where, specifically, it believes this Court erred in its analysis. Thus, for the reasons\nstated in both the TRO Memorandum and the Preliminary Injunction Memorandum, the Court\nconcludes that the Government has not identified an \u201cadmittedly difficult legal question\u201d on which\nthe Court may have erred, Ict alone a strong likelihood of success.\n\nMost significantly, even assuming that the Government has identified an \u201cadmittedly\ndifficult legal question,\u201d and assuming further that this showing would suffice to satisfy the first\nstay factor under Nken, the Court would stil] deny the Government\u2019s request. The Government\nprotests that the Court\u2019s order is \u201cextraordinarily burdensome.\u201d (ECF No. 131-1 at 5.) The Court\ndoes not doubt this, and indeed explicitly acknowledged as much in its Preliminary Injunction\nMemorandum, while nevertheless stating that \u201cthe Government cannot engage in far-reaching\nillegal activity and then complain that the remedy is too burdensome.\u201d (ECF No. 125 at 68.)\nMoreover, while the Court continues to recognize the considerable public interests that favor the\nGovernment\u2019s position, it also continues to hold that those interests are outweighed by the public\ninterest in complying with lawful RIF notice procedures and by the magnitude of the harms\nimposed on the States in the absence of immediate injunctive relief.\n\nAs the Court\u2019s Memorandum makes clear, it has not taken the prospect of issuing a\npreliminary injunction against the Government lightly. Courts must respect the limits of their\n\nauthority and must be especially cautious when enjoining the activities of a coequal coordinate\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document134 Filed 04/04/25 Page5of5\n\nbranch of government. But, in our federal system, other actors, such as these Plaintiff States, are\nentitled to seek redress in court\u2014including, in extraordinary circumstances, by obtaining\npreliminary injunctive relief against the federal government. The Court took pains to ensure that\nthe injunction it crafted was no more burdensome to the Government than necessary to redress the\nirreparable harms faced by the Plaintiff States. But the care that the Court took in limiting the\nscope of relief should not be equated with any doubt in the Court\u2019s mind about the necessity of the\nrelief it ordered. That relicf was necessary on April 1, and it remains so today.\n\nFor these reasons, and for those stated in the Court\u2019s Preliminary Injunction Memorandum,\n\n(ECF No. 125), it is ORDERED that the Motion to Stay, (ECF No. 131), is DENIED.\n\nDated this 4-day of April, 2025at_ /fi22 A.M., ERT.\n\nBY THE COURT:\n\nJames K. Bredar\nUnited States District Judge\n\n",

As the Court observed in granting a temporary restraining order (TRO), \u201c[i]t is generally\n\nlogically inconsistent for a court to issue a TRO or preliminary injunction and then stay that order,\n\nas the findings on which those decisions are premised are almost perfect opposites.\u201d ECF 43 at\n\n53. Defendants\u2019 stay motion rehashes the same arguments they made in opposing Plaintiffs\u2019\n\nmotion for a preliminary injunction. For the same reasons Plaintiffs previously articulated, see\n\nECF 78-1, these arguments fail. The Court rightly rejected them only days ago on the same record\n\nbefore the Court now. See ECF 125. Defendants have not carried their burden of showing that a\n\ndiscretionary stay is warranted.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    1\n\f        Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 133        Filed 04/04/25      Page 2 of 8\n\n\n\n                                          ARGUMENT\n\n        A stay pending appeal is \u201can exercise of judicial discretion,\u201d and not a \u201cmatter of right.\u201d\n\nNken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 433 (2009) (quoting Virginia R. Co. v. United States, 272 U.S. 658,\n\n672 (1926)). Indeed, \u201ca stay is considered \u2018extraordinary relief\u2019 for which the moving party bears\n\na \u2018heavy burden.\u2019\u201d Common Cause v. Rucho, 284 F. Supp. 3d 780, 783 (M.D.N.C. 2018). A party\n\nseeking a stay must demonstrate (1) \u201ca strong showing that [it] is likely to succeed on the merits,\u201d\n\n(2) irreparable injury absent a stay; (3) that issuance of a stay will not substantially injure other\n\nparties interested in the proceedings, and (4) that the public interest favors a stay. Nken, 556 U.S.\n\nat 433-35 (quoting Hilton v. Braunskill, 481 U.S. 770, 776 (1987)). The first two factors are most\n\nimportant, and it is not enough to show a \u201cbetter than negligible\u201d chance of success on the merits\n\nor a mere \u201cpossibility of irreparable injury.\u201d Id. at 434. Defendants fail each prong, and their\n\nmotion should be denied.\n\n   I.      Defendants Are Not Likely to Succeed on the Merits.\n\n        In granting the preliminary injunction motion, the Court found that the Plaintiffs States are\n\nlikely to succeed on the merits. ECF 125 at 39-64. Defendants advance no new justiciability or\n\nmerits arguments and offer no new evidence that might undercut the Court\u2019s conclusion.\n\n        Defendants have not established that the Court erred in concluding that \u201cthere is no\n\njusticiability defect that would divest it of jurisdiction over this action.\u201d ECF 125 at 10. With\n\nrespect to standing, the Court reviewed in detail the record evidence establishing that Plaintiffs\n\nhave suffered informational injuries and follow-on downstream harms stemming from the\n\ninformational deficit. ECF 125 at 12-27. The Court also explained that Plaintiffs\u2019 injuries are\n\ntraceable to Defendants and that Plaintiffs\u2019 injuries would be redressed by an order of the Court\n\nbarring Defendants from conducting unlawful RIFs and restoring unlawfully terminated\n\n\n\n\n                                                 2\n\f         Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB            Document 133    Filed 04/04/25     Page 3 of 8\n\n\n\nemployees to their positions. ECF 125 at 27-29. With respect to Defendants\u2019 contention that\n\nCongress divested the Court of jurisdiction over Plaintiffs\u2019 claims, the Court applied the\n\nframework set out in Thunder Basin Coal Co. v. Reich, 510 U.S. 200 (1994), and correctly rejected\n\nthose arguments. ECF 125 at 33-39.\n\n         Defendants likewise recycle their merits argument that their mass terminations of more\n\nthan 24,000 probationary employees over the course of a few weeks without individualized\n\nconsideration were not RIFs. The Court considered and rejected this argument too, explaining that\n\neven Defendants\u2019 own briefing indicates that the terminations were RIFs. ECF 125 at 42-52.\n\nDefendants offer no reason why the Court should reverse these findings now.\n\n         The closest Defendants come to a new argument is their contention that a stay would be\n\nwarranted if the issues before the Court present \u201can admittedly difficult legal question.\u201d ECF 131-\n\n1 at 3. But Defendants fail to square that standard with the requirement that they must also show\n\na \u201cstrong\u201d likelihood of success on the merits. Nken, 556 U.S. at 434. In any event, Defendants\n\nhave not raised any \u201cadmittedly difficult legal questions,\u201d let alone one that the Court did not\n\nresolve decisively in Plaintiffs\u2019 favor.\n\n         Because Defendants\u2019 arguments are duplicative of those raised in the preliminary\n\ninjunction briefing and that the Court has already rejected, Defendants have failed to make a\n\n\u201cstrong showing\u201d that they are likely to prevail. Nken, 556 U.S. at 434.\n\n   II.      Defendants Have Not Shown That Equitable Factors Favor a Stay.\n\n         Similarly, Defendants have not shown an entitlement to relief under the remaining three\n\nstay factors. Defendants insist that the Court has \u201cinterfere[d] in the Federal government\u2019s\n\nrelationship with its workforce\u201d and that the preliminary remedy is overly burdensome. But\n\nDefendants ignore that, as the Court explained, \u201cthe Government cannot engage in far-reaching\n\n\n\n\n                                                  3\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB              Document 133    Filed 04/04/25      Page 4 of 8\n\n\n\nillegal activity and then complain that the remedy is too burdensome.\u201d ECF 125 at 68. Further,\n\naccording to their March 17 status report, most Defendants have already rescinded the terminations\n\nof a majority of their probationary employees pursuant to the TRO. ECF No. 52. The preliminary\n\ninjunction merely requires those Defendants to continue maintaining these established\n\nemployment relationships during the pendency of the litigation, and with only a narrower subset\n\nof probationary employees at that. Defendants\u2019 claimed injuries related to the preliminary\n\ninjunction are thus minimal. See League of Women Voters of N.C. v. North Carolina, 769 F.3d 224,\n\n248 (4th Cir. 2014) (finding burden on government to restore status quo was lessened because\n\nrelevant \u201csystems have existed, do exist, and simply need to be resurrected,\u201d and other measures\n\n\u201cmerely require[] the revival of previous practices\u201d). Defendants likewise ignore the Court\u2019s\n\nexplanation that, \u201cin the absence of injunctive relief, the Government\u2019s desired quick reduction in\n\ncosts will inevitably correspond to a surge in costs borne by the Plaintiff States in responding to\n\nthe unnoticed mass terminations.\u201d ECF 125 at 68. As a result, Defendants fail to show that the\n\nequitable factors, including irreparable harm to Defendants, injury to other interested parties, and\n\nthe public interest warrant a stay here.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  4\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 133    Filed 04/04/25    Page 5 of 8\n\n\n\nApril 4, 2025                                Respectfully submitted,\n\n\n\n ANTHONY G.

INTRODUCTION\n\nThe government can terminate probationary employees en masse (i.e., dismiss them via a\nreduction in force, or \u201cRIF\u201d\u2019), but when it does so it must follow certain laws and regulations.\nRecently, government agencies executed a series of mass terminations, but when they did so, on\nthe record before the Court, they failed to follow mandatory RIF procedures.\n\nState governments are some of the intended beneficiaries of the mandates the federal\ngovernment failed to follow, and because the states (and the District of Columbia) that brought\nthis action were and likely continue to be irreparably harmed by the federal government's failures,\na preliminary injunction must enter to restore the status quo, and to prevent further harm to the\nplaintiffs while this case is pending. Specifically, the federal government must restore the\nemployment of those whose sudden terminations so burdened the plaintiffs (or, it must maintain\nthe same to the extent it has already restored employees pursuant to the TRO), and it must refrain\nfrom further unlawful mass terminations, or RIFs, that would impact the plaintiffs, while this case\nis pending.\n\nNot every state joined this lawsuit\u2014thirty-one did not. It is sometimes appropriate\u2014even\nnecessary\u2014for courts to issue nationwide injunctions stopping unlawful actions of the\nGovernment. But those instances are rare, and this case is not one of them. National injunctions\nare warranted only when it is not possible to craft narrower relief that will fully and appropriately\nremedy the harms unlawfully imposed on parties to the particular lawsuit, or when more narrow\nrelief would be otherwise unworkable, grossly inequitable, or strongly contrary to the public\ninterest. The Court\u2019s injunction is not national in scope because it is possible to substantially stop\nthe harms inflicted on the states that did sue without extending judicial authority over those that\n\ndidn\u2019t. Further, while some inequity is inevitable without a national injunction, there is a powerful\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document125 Filed 04/01/25 Page 4of 84\n\ncountervailing public interest in the Court respecting the likely carefully considered judgments of\nthe thirty-one non-party states nor to join this lawsuit, tipping the balance in favor of more limited\nrelief. Perhaps a broader injunction would be in order if this action were on behalf of the thousands\nof employees who were laid off, the circumstances of each likely being similar if not identical to\nthose of the others, and there being little doubt that the harms visited on some were representative\nof those experienced by all, or almost all. But this is not that case. Only states have sued here,\nand only to vindicate their interests as states. They are not proxies for the workers. Presumably\nwell informed, each state is entitled to decide for itself whether it will seek relief in the present\ncircumstances; it would be inappropriate for the Court to fashion relief having the consequence\nthat decisions properly reserved to the non-party states are effectively, and unnecessarily,\noverruled by this Court.\n\nAll this said, at this preliminary stage, the Court finds that the recent actions of the\ndefendant government agencies (and the officials leading them), now including the Office of\nPersonnel Management and the Department of Defense as to its probationary civilian employees,\nprobably broke the laws that regulate en masse terminations of government employees, and this to\nthe continuing and irreparable harm of the Plaintiff States. The appropriate remedy now, until\nfinal judgment is entered, is entry of a preliminary injunction restoring the employment of those\nfederal probationary workers whose sudden layoffs without requisite notice likely have harmed,\nare harming, and will continue to harm the Plaintiff States if not immediately stopped.\n\nIl. BACKGROUND\nA. Factual Background\nPlaintiffs, which include nineteen states and the District of Columbia (\u201cthe States\u201d), filed\n\nsuit against forty-one Defendants, which include cabinet agencies and their secretaries as well as\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document125 Filed 04/01/25 Page 5 of 84\n\nother federal agencies and their heads (collectively, \u201cthe Government\u201d). (See generally ECF No.\n1.) The States challenge the Government\u2019s termination of probationary federal employees as being\ncontrary to law and arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d) and\nas being ultra vires.' (See generally id.)\n\nThe Court previously described the facts that led to the filing of this suit in detail in its\nMemorandum accompanying the Temporary Restraining Order (\u201cTRO\u201d) issued on March 13,\n2025. (TRO Mem., TRO Mem. at 4-13), reproduced as Maryland vy. USDA, Civ. No. JKB-25-\n748, 2025 WL 800216 (D. Md. Mar. 13, 2025).* The Court described the requirements for\nterminating probationary employees, along with the actions allegedly taken by the Government,\nand the harms allegedly suffered by the States. (Jd.) The Court incorporates by reference that\nbackground, and will provide only a brief synopsis of the facts and legal background here.\nFurthermore, additional factual details will be provided as relevant to the Court\u2019s discussion of\nstanding and the States\u2019 likelihood of success on the merits.\n\nMost employees in the federal civil service are considered to be in a probationary status\nfor the first year or two of their employment. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3321(a), 7511(a)(1)(A)(ii),\n7511(a)(1)(C)Gi); 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.801. Regulations provide for certain ways in which probationary\nemployees may be terminated. As is particularly relevant here, one such way is as part of a RIF.\n5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502; 5 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 351.201-.902. The statute and regulations prescribe detailed\n\nprocedures that federal agencies must follow when conducting a RIF\u2014agencies must, among other\n\n' Because the Court can resolve the question of preliminary injunctive relief on the basis of the Plaintiff\nStates\u2019 APA contrary-to-law claim alone, as at the TRO stage, it will not consider the other two claims at\nthis time.\n\n? Subsequent references to the Court\u2019s TRO Memorandum will cite to the document on the Court\u2019s\nelectronic docket. Furthermore, citations to that Memorandum, and to other items on the docket, cite to the\nECF pagination, rather than to the document\u2019s original pagination.\n\n3\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document125 Filed 04/01/25 Page 6 of 84\n\nrequirements: identify \u201ccompetitive areas\u201d in which employees potentially subject to a RIF may\ncompete for retention; rank employees based on various criteria such as veteran status and length\nof service; and\u2014critically important here\u2014provide advance notice to \u201cthe State or entity\ndesignated by the State to carry out rapid response activities under section 134(a)(2)(A) of the\nWorkforce Investment Act of 1998,\u201d now titled the Workplace Innovation and Opportunity Act\n(\u201cWIOA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 3174(a)(2)(A). 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502; see also 5 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 351.402-04, 504.\nThe WIOA, in turn, requires states to provide various immediate emergency services to employees\naffected by mass layoffs or disasters. See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 3174(a); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 682.302, .305. Notice\nof a RIF must be provided to the State sixty days in advance of any terminations, or\u2014if the Office\nof Personnel Management (\u201cOPM\u201d) determines that unforeseeable circumstances require more\nrapid terminations\u2014at least thirty days in advance. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3502(d)(1), 3502(e)(1)-(3); 5\nC.F.R. \u00a7 351.801. The statute provides that, if advance notice is not given, \u201can employee may not\nbe released, due to a reduction in force.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d)(1).\n\nThe States allege that, in response to directives from OPM and executive orders issued in\nthe early weeks of the current Administration, the Government began terminating large numbers\nof probationary employees, pursuant at least in part to a directive from OPM ordering agencies to\nterminate non\u2014\u201cmission critical\u201d probationers by February 27, 2025. (ECF No. 1 4 102-112.)\nThey allege that at least 24,000 probationary employees were terminated as part of these mass\nlayoffs (id. {| 139); this allegation is consistent with status reports submitted by the Government,\n(ECF Nos. 52, 103). The States also allege\u2014and the Government does not contest\u2014that they\nwere not provided any advance notice of such terminations. (/d. \u00a7 148.)\n\nAs catalogued in detail below in the Court\u2019s discussion of standing, see infra Section III.A,\n\nthe Government\u2019s mass layoffs predictably led to an influx of newly jobless employees turning to\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document125 Filed 04/01/25 Page 7 of 84\n\nthe States for unemployment benefits and other social services. Because the States had not\nreceived any advance notice of the layoffs, as contemplated by the RIF statute and accompanying\nregulations, they were caught flat-footed and have had to scramble to respond. The States have\nincurred or expect to imminently incur costs resulting from, inter alia, processing and investigating\nunemployment benefit applications, diverting resources from other state programs, and loss of\nrevenue from taxes on the wages of probationary employees. See id.\n\nB. Procedural History\n\nOn March 7, 2025, the States filed a Motion for Temporary Restraining Order. (ECF No.\n4.) The Court held a Hearing on the Motion on March 12, 2025. (ECF No. 28.) The Court granted\nthe Motion and issued a TRO the following day, March 13, 2025. (TRO Mem.; TRO, ECF No.\n44.) Unless otherwise noted, the Court continues to ratify the conclusions and findings made in\nthe TRO Memorandum, and incorporates that Memorandum by reference into this opinion.\n\nIn brief, the Court concluded that the States\u2014or at least some subset of them\u2014had\nstanding, that the challenged dismissals without notice were final agency actions, and that Thunder\nBasin Coal Co. v. Reich, 510 U.S. 200 (1994), did not preclude the Court\u2019s review of the States\u2019\nclaims. (TRO Mem. at 14-32.) The Court next examined the factors for evaluating injunctive\nrelief set forth in Winter v. Natural Resources Defense Council, 555 U.S. 7 (2008), and concluded\nthat the States were very likely to succeed on the merits of their APA contrary-to-law claim,\nbecause most of the Defendant Agencies\u2019 conducted RIFs, but did not comply with the requisite\nnotice requirements to the States. (/d. at 32-42.) The Court concluded that the other Winter\n\nfactors\u2014irreparability of the harm, balance of the equities, and public interest\u2014also tipped in\n\n* The Court concluded that the States did not provide sufficient evidence that three Defendant Agencies\nengaged in RIFs, considering the high bar to TRO relief. (TRO Mem. at 41.)\n\n5\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document125 Filed 04/01/25 Page 8 of 84\n\nfavor of the States. (/d. at 43-46.) Finally, the Court examined the appropriate scope of relief,\nand concluded that a nationwide TRO maintaining the status quo was appropriate. (/d. at 46-54.)\n\nThe TRO stayed all purported terminations of Affected Probationary Employees by\nRestrained Defendants,* ordered the reinstatement of all Affected Probationary Employees by\nRestrained Defendants, and enjoined Restrained Defendants from conducting any future RIFs\nexcept in compliance with the relevant notice requirements and other applicable laws and\nregulations. (TRO 4] 2-4.) The Court also directed the filing of a status report by Restrained\nDefendants documenting actions taken to comply with the TRO. (/d. \u00a7 5.)\n\nThe Government filed the requisite Status Report on March 17, 2025. (ECF No. 52.) The\nGovernment provided declarations from the Restrained Defendants documenting their compliance\nwith the TRO. (/d.) The Court issued a further Order, explaining that \u201c[t]he Status Report reflects\nthat the Restrained Defendants have made meaningful progress toward compliance with the TRO\u201d\nand directing the filing of a second Status Report. (ECF No. 72.)\n\nOn March 20, 2025, the States filed the pending Motion for a Section 705\u00b0 Stay and\nPreliminary Injunction (the \u201cPreliminary Injunction Motion\u201d). (ECF No. 78.) Shortly thereafter,\nthe States also filed a Motion to Extend Temporary Restraining Order. (ECF No. 85.) The parties\nproposed a briefing schedule (ECF No. 84), which the Court adopted. (ECF No. 97.) The Court\nalso directed the parties to brief the proper scope of any injunctive relief. (/d.) The parties filed\n\nthe briefing. (ECF Nos. 101-02.)\n\n\u2018In this section of this Memorandum, terms have the same meaning as provided in the TRO. (See TRO 4\n10.)\n\n> \u201cSection 705\u201d refers to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 705, the provision of the APA that governs relief pending judicial\nreview.\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document125 Filed 04/01/25 Page 9 of 84\n\nThe Court held a Hearing on the Preliminary Injunction Motion on March 26, 2025. (See\nECF No. 112; ECF No. 119 (Hearing Transcript).) At the Hearing, as supplemented by an Order\ndocketed later that day, the Court sought additional briefing from the parties on the scope of any\ninjunctive relief. (See ECF No. 114.) The parties filed the requested briefing the following day.\n(ECF Nos. 116-17.)\n\nFurther, the Court granted the States\u2019 Motion to Extend Temporary Restraining Order, and\nextended the TRO by five days, to 8:00 p.m. on April 1, 2025. (ECF No. 115.)\n\nThe Court also notes that the Government filed a Notice of Appeal on March 14, 2025, and\nthen appealed entry of the TRO. (ECF No. 46.) The appeal has been docketed with the United\nStates Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit at Docket Number 25-1248. The Government\nsought an administrative stay or stay pending the resolution of the appeal. The Court of Appeals\ndenied this request, \u201c[g]iven the district court\u2019s stated intention to hold a hearing on March 26,\n2025, and to promptly grant or deny preliminary injunctive relief thereafter.\u201d (ECF No. 93.)\n\nIl. REVIEWABILITY\n\nThe Court previously held that some subset of the States had standing to seek a TRO, that\nthe dismissals without notice to the States were reviewable final agency actions, and that, under\nthe Thunder Basin doctrine, district-court jurisdiction over the States\u2019 lawsuit was not foreclosed\nby Congress\u2019s choice to channel certain related claims into an administrative review scheme. (See\nTRO Mem. at 14-32.)\n\nThe Court sees no reason to depart from those conclusions. What follows is a summary of\nthe Court\u2019s prior analyses of justiciability and jurisdiction, along with the Court\u2019s responses to\n\nnew arguments advanced by the parties on those topics.\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document125 Filed 04/01/25 Page 10 of 84\n\nA. Justiciability\u00ae\n\nIn its decision granting the States\u2019 request for a TRO, the Court held that at least one State,\nMaryland, had clearly established standing to invoke federal jurisdiction over its claims. (See TRO\nMem. at 14-23 & n.3.)\n\nAs explained in the TRO Memorandum, the requirement of standing is an \u201cessential and\nunchanging part\u201d of the Constitution\u2019s case-or-controversy limitation on the jurisdiction of the\nfederal courts. Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992). It demands that a plaintiff\nshow (1) an injury in fact, meaning a harm that is \u201cconcrete, particularized, and actual or\nimminent\u201d; (2) traceability, meaning that the injury \u201cwas likely caused by the defendant\u201d; and (3)\nredressability, meaning that the injury \u201cwould likely be redressed by judicial relief.\u201d TransUnion\nLLC vy. Ramirez, 594 U.S. 413, 423 (2021) (citing Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560-61). Without standing,\n\u201cthere is no case or controversy for the federal court to resolve.\u201d Jd. (quoting Casillas v. Madison\na0 Assocs., Inc., 926 F.3d 329, 333 (7th Cir. 2019) (Barrett, J.)).\n\nImportantly, \u201c[s]tanding is not dispensed in gross.\u201d Davis v. FEC, 554 U.S. 724, 734\n(2008) (quoting Lewis v. Casey, 518 U.S. 343, 358 n.6 (1996)). Rather, a plaintiff must establish\nstanding for each claim it presses and for each form of relief it seeks. Jd. (citing DaimlerChrysler\nCorp. v. Cuno, 547 U.S. 332, 352 (2006)).\n\nThe Court continues to conclude that there is no justiciability defect that would divest it of\njurisdiction over this action. And, unlike in its decision on the States\u2019 request for a TRO, the Court\nnow finds that a// Plaintiff States\u2014not just Maryland\u2014have alleged facts sufficient for the Court\n\nto draw a likely inference of standing to pursue preliminary injunctive relief. At the preliminary\n\n* Aside from standing, the Government has not argued that the Court lacks jurisdiction by virtue of a defect\nin the justiciability of the States\u2019 claims. (See ECF No. 20 at 12-23; ECF No. 101 at 12\u201415.) Because the\nCourt continues to perceive no such defect, this section addresses standing only.\n\n8\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document125 Filed 04/01/25 Page 11 of 84\n\ninjunction stage, that is enough. See Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561 (\u201c[E]ach element [of standing] must\nbe supported in the same way as any other matter on which the plaintiff bears the burden of proof,\ni.e., with the manner and degree of evidence required at the successive stages of the litigation.\u201d).\n\nThe Court considers each element of standing in turn.\n\n1. Injury in Fact\n\nTo be constitutionally cognizable, all putative injuries in fact must satisfy three basic\nrequirements. First, they must be \u201c\u2018concrete\u2019\u201d\u2014that is, \u201creal, and not abstract.\u201d TransUnion, 594\nU.S. at 424 (quoting Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 578 U.S. 330, 340 (2016)). Second, they must be\n\u201cparticularized,\u201d \u201caffect[ing] the plaintiff in a personal and individual way.\u201d Spokeo, 578 U.S. at\n339 (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560 n.1). And third, they must be \u201cactual or imminent,\u201d such that\nthey have already occurred or else are \u201ccertainly impending.\u201d See Clapper v. Amnesty Int'l, USA,\n568 U.S. 398, 409 (2013).\n\nIn its Memorandum addressing the States\u2019 request for a TRO, the Court observed that the\nStates\u2019 theory of injury boiled down to one of informational harm. (See TRO Mem. at 15-21.)\nUnder that theory, each State did not receive information to which it was legally entitled and each\nState experienced harm as a result of that deprivation. (See id. at 15-16.)\n\nThe Court continues to view the States\u2019 asserted injuries as fundamentally informational.\nAnd it continues to stand by its earlier conclusion that each State has, to the degree of evidence\nrequired at the preliminary-injunction stage, shown its informational injury to be a constitutionally\ncognizable injury in fact.\n\nIn support of this determination, the Court will first review the harms the Plaintiff States\nhave alleged or described by record evidence and address why it finds each Plaintiff State to have\n\nshown a likelihood of suffering at least one such harm. The Court will then explain how most of\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document125 Filed 04/01/25 Page 12 of 84\n\nthe harms\u2014 including those each State has shown a likelihood of experiencing\u2014satisfy the three\nrequirements for an injury in fact: concreteness, particularity, and actualness or imminence.\ni Injuries Alleged or Described by Record Evidence\n\nThe Court starts with certain of the States\u2019 most relevant allegations, namely, those that\nconcern ail Plaintiff States. In the Complaint, the States allege federal employees reside and/or\nwork in each of the Plaintiff States, (ECF No. 1 \u00a7 74), and that no Plaintiff State received notice\nof any past or upcoming RIF, (id. {| 5-6, 74, 101, 139, 156, 160-61, 167). They allege that each\nPlaintiff State \u201cmust now deal with a sudden surge in unemployment[] without the advance notice\u201d\nrequired. (/d. \u00a7 101.) They allege that each Plaintiff State, in accordance with federal law,\noperates a rapid-response team \u201cthat provide[s] immediate services and resources to workers\nsubject to mass layoffs,\u201d (id. 4/5); that each Plaintiff State has an unemployment-assistance\nprogram, (id. | 171); and that each Plaintiff State \u201cha[s] seen or anticipate[s] seeing an uptick in\n[unemployment-insurance] claims in the areas in which the probationary employee layoffs\noccurred\u201d\u2014a circumstance that \u201chas burdened and will continue to burden state agencies charged\nwith administering\u201d those benefits, (id. \u00a7 204). The States also allege that the unnoticed firings\nwill burden the administration of other social-service programs, including \u201chealth care and food\nassistance.\u201d (Jd. \u00a7 205.) They allege that each Plaintiff State will lose out on \u201csignificant\u201d income-\ntax revenue, given that Defendant Agencies \u201cwill no longer be withholding and paying income\ntaxes to Plaintiff States on behalf of the terminated probationary employees.\u201d (/d. \u00a7 215.) And\n\nthey allege that the Plaintiff States will be deprived of state sales-tax revenues as a result of large\n\nnumbers of newly out-of-work people less willing to spend money in the marketplace. (See id.\n\n{ 219.)\n\n10\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document125 Filed 04/01/25 Page 13 of 84\n\nNext, the Court turns to the record. As an initial matter, the record evidence explicitly\nconfirms twelve States\u2019 allegations of not having received notice of any actual or impending RIFs.\n(See ECF No. 4-6 \u00a7 10 (Arizona); ECF No. 4-7 \u00a7 13 (California); ECF No. 4-39 \u00a7 14 (Colorado);\nECF No. 4-8 \u00a7 29 (Illinois); ECF No. 4-5 \u00a7 16 (Maryland); ECF No. 4-9 \u00a7 15 (Massachusetts);\nECF No. 78-17 {6 (Michigan); ECF No. 4-11 \u00a7 13 (New Jersey); ECF No. 78-18 \u00a7 17 (New\nMexico); ECF No. 4-13 \u00a7 8 (New York); ECF No. 4-14 \u00a7 14 (Oregon); ECF No. 4-15 \u00a7 20 (Rhode\nIsland).)\n\nThe record also shows ten States explicitly identifying an increase\u2014often a sharp one\u2014in\nunemployment benefits applications coming from former federal workers. (See ECF No. 4-6 4 6\n(Arizona); ECF No. 4-7 \u00a7\u00a7 14-15, 30 (California); ECF No. 4-39 \u00a7] 15 (Colorado); ECF No. 4-8\n{| 15-16 (Illinois); ECF No. 4-5 \u00a7\u00a7 17-18, 50-52 (Maryland); ECF No. 4-9 \u00a7\u00a7 16-17, 41-45\n(Massachusetts); ECF No. 78-17 {ff 8, 22 (Michigan); ECF No. 4-11 \u00a7\u00a7 14-15, 29 (New Jersey);\nECF No. 78-18 4 18, 37 (New Mexico); ECF No. 4-13 \u00a7 4 (New York).)\n\nBecause of that uptick, nine of those ten States confirm or project increases in the cost of\nprocessing and investigating an influx of unemployment-assistance claims, in no small part\nbecause state unemployment agencies are typically obligated under state law to determine whether\nindividuals were actually terminated for cause in order to assess their eligibility for benefits. (See\nECF No. 4-7 4] 33-38, 41 (California); ECF No. 4-39 {\u00a7 27-28 (Colorado); ECF No. 4-8 9 17\u2014\n27 (Illinois); ECF No. 4-5 \u00a7\u00a7 57-59, 67-70, 72-74 (Maryland); ECF No. 4-9 \u00a7 47-54\n(Massachusetts); ECF No. 78-17 \u00a7\u00a7 6, 8, 23-27, 29-30, 33 (Michigan); ECF No. 4-11 4 16-18,\n34-40 (New Jersey); ECF No. 78-18 {45-48 (New Mexico); ECF No. 4-13 \u00a75 (New York).)\nFive of these ten States confirm or project that more benefits will eventually need to be paid out\n\nto those claimants. (See ECF No. 4-7 4 40, 42-43 (California); ECF No. 4-8 \u00a7 26 (Illinois); ECF\n\n11\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document125 Filed 04/01/25 Page 14 of 84\n\nNo. 78-17 4 32, 34-35 (Michigan); ECF No. 4-11 4] 41-42 (New Jersey); ECF No. 78-18 \u00a7\u00a7 49-\n51 (New Mexico).) Individual declarations likewise suggest that at least five States have incurred\nor will incur costs vis-a-vis unemployment-benefits payouts, (see ECF Nos. 33-13 \u00a7 7, 33-14 6\n(California); ECF Nos. 33-15 4 6, 33-16 \u00a7 6 (Delaware); ECF Nos. 33-2 8, 78-15 \u00a7 12, 78-20 9 7\n(Maryland); ECF No. 78-13 \u00a7 7 (Minnesota); ECF Nos. 33-3 \u00a7 7, 33-4 \u00a7 7, 33-5 4 7, 33-6 \u00a7 7, 33-\n74 7, 33-8 { 7, 33-10 4 6, 33-11 \u00a7 7, 33-12 4 7, 78-14 4 8, 78-19 \u00a7 6 (Washington, D.C.)), and/or\nsuggest that at least four will experience the same with respect to payouts less directly related to\nemployment, such as those made under health-benefits or food-assistance programs. (See ECF\nNo. 78-20 47 (Maryland); ECF No. 78-13 47 (Minnesota); ECF No. 33-17 \u00a7 9 (Rhode Island);\nECF Nos. 33-4 \u00a7 7, 33-6 \u00a7 7, 33-8 \u00a7 7, 33-12 \u00a7 7 (Washington, D.C.).)\n\nThe record evidence also shows nine States confirming or projecting costs from having to\nramp up and operate their rapid-response programs with no advance notice or critical information.\nThese costs include raw financial, time, and labor costs, such as those incurred in standing up\nwebsites and telephone hotlines, as well as costs associated with diverting money and employees\naway from their intended purpose and toward monitoring and outreach efforts. (See ECF No. 4-7\n{| 16-20 (California); ECF No. 4-39 \u00a7 16 (Colorado); ECF No. 4-8 \u00a7] 28\u201434 (Illinois); ECF No.\n4-5 \u00a7] 19-30 (Maryland); ECF No. 4-9 \u00a7\u00a7 18-30 (Massachusetts); ECF No. 4-11 \u00a7\u00a7 16-18 (New\nJersey); ECF No. 78-18 9] 19-25 (New Mexico); ECF No. 4-13 45 (New York); ECF No. 4-14\n{| 15-19 (Oregon).)\n\nTwo States expressly predict that unnoticed terminations will lead to significant losses of\ntax revenue and harms to their labor markets, (see ECF No. 4-38 \u00a7\u00a7 5\u201410 (Maryland); ECF No. 4-\n35 {| 13-15 (Washington, D.C.)), and declarants connected with five States (including one non-\n\nPlaintiff State) expect not to be able to support those States\u2019 economies or tax bases in the same\n\n12\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document125 Filed 04/01/25 Page 15 of 84\n\nway as before their terminations, (see ECF Nos. 33-2 \u00a7\u00a7 9-10, 33-6 9\u00a7 8-9, 33-8 9\u00a7 8-10, 78-14\n{| 9, 78-15 13, 78-20 {7 (Maryland); ECF No. 33-17 \u00a7\u00a7 10-11 (Massachusetts); id. \u00a7 10 (Rhode\nIsland); ECF No. 33-11 4 8 (Virginia); ECF Nos. 33-3 4 8-9, 12; 33-4 4] 8-9; 33-5 9 8-9; 33-7\nTf 8-9; 33-8 4 8; 33-9 J 9-10; 33-10 4] 7-8; 33-11 | 8; 33-12 J 8-9; 78-19 4 7 (Washington,\nD.C.)).\n\nThree States expressly anticipate costs due to a loss of the services of federal employees,\nwhether those are employees embedded in or working in close partnership with state agencies, (see\nECF No. 4-10 {\u00a7 5-6 (Massachusetts); ECF No. 4-12 \u00a7\u00a7 6-14 (New Jersey); ECF No. 4-15 9\u00a7 7\u2014\n20 (Rhode Island)), or else working solely for the federal government but serving critical\nfunctions\u2014such as approving state siuiniiciedcalfiigare programs\u2014on which the States depend,\n(see ECF No. 4-10 \u00a7 7-10 (Massachusetts)). And various individual declarants confirm that, as\nan immediate consequence of their termination, Defendant Agencies ceased withholding and\npaying withheld income taxes to at least five Plaintiff States. (See ECF Nos. 33-13 9 9, 33-1448\n(California); ECF Nos. 33-15 { 8, 33-16 | 8 (Delaware); ECF Nos. 33-1 \u00a7 9, 33-2 \u00a7 10, 33-6 49,\n33-8 4 10, 78-14 \u00a7 10, 78-15 \u00a7 14, 78-20 \u00a7 8 (Maryland); ECF No. 33-17 \u00a7 11 (Massachusetts);\nECF Nos. 33-3 412, 33-4 99, 33-5 49, 33-7 9.9, 33-9 9 10, 33-10 4 8, 33-12 99, 78-19 4 10\n(Washington, D.C.).)\n\nOn top of all that, the record contains declarations from laid-off probationary employees\nwho work and/or reside in a total of nine different States, seven of which are plaintiffs in this\naction. (See ECF No. 33-13 (California resident with \u201cclosest geographic headquarters\u201d in Texas);\nECF No. 33-14 (California resident with California duty station); ECF No. 33-15 (Delaware\nresident with Maryland duty station); ECF No. 33-16 (Delaware resident with Delaware duty\n\nstation); ECF Nos. 33-1, 33-6, 33-8, 78-14 (Maryland residents with Washington, D.C., duty\n\n13\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document125 Filed 04/01/25 Page 16 of 84\n\nstations); ECF Nos. 33-2, 78-15, 78-20 (Maryland residents with Maryland duty stations); ECF\nNo. 33-17 (Rhode Island resident with Massachusetts duty station); ECF No. 33-18, 33-19, 78-13\n(Minnesota residents with Minnesota duty stations); ECF No. 33-3, 33-4, 33-5, 33-7, 33-9, 33-10,\n33-12, 78-19 (Washington, D.C., residents with Washington, D.C., duty stations); ECF No. 33-11\n(Virginia resident with Washington, D.C., duty station).)\n\nFinally, the Court observes that the record contains no evidence beyond the pleadings\nspecifically relevant to five Plaintiff States: Connecticut, Hawai\u2019i, Nevada, Vermont, and\nWisconsin.\n\nWhile the amount and type of record evidence varies as to each Plaintiff State, taken as a\nwhole, that evidence, together with the well-pleaded allegations, reveals a strong likelihood of\nstanding for every plaintiff.\n\nAs the Court has already observed, it is axiomatic that \u201ceach element [of standing] must be\nsupported in the same way as any other matter on which the plaintiff bears the burden of proof,\ni.e., with the manner and degree of evidence required at the successive stages of the litigation.\u201d\nLujan, 504 U.S. at 561. At this early stage, the Court would ordinarily look solely to the allegations\nto discern whether the States had set out enough factual matter to permit a plausible inference of\nstanding. See, e.g., Adams v. Bain, 697 F.2d 1213, 1219 (4th Cir. 1982); Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556\nU.S. 662, 678 (2009). Of course, the Plaintiff States here seek a preliminary injunction, requiring\nan early showing of their likelihood of success on the merits, Winter, 555 U.S. at 20, which itself\nmust be supported by at least some record evidence (i.e., by more than just unverified pleadings),\nsee 11A Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 2949 & n.13\n\n(3d ed. 2024) (collecting cases). And as the Government rightly notes, \u201c[a] plaintiff unlikely to\n\n14\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document125 Filed 04/01/25 Page 17 of 84\n\nhave standing is ipso facto unlikely to succeed\u201d in its cause. Elec. Priv. Info. Ctr. v. Presidential\nAdvisory Comm'n on Election Integrity, 878 F.3d 371, 375 n.2 (D.C. Cir. 2017).\n\nThe States have met their burden. They have amply identified a system-wide course of\nconduct designed to terminate federal probationary employees en masse. While this design was\nrealized in some instances and merely forecasted in others, on balance, it would be naive and\ncontrary to the record for the Court to conclude that five Plaintiff States, because of a lack of record\nevidence specifically about them, have not suffered and will not soon suffer at least one injury\nsufficient for standing. After all, tens of thousands of probationary employees work for the federal\ngovernment throughout the country. (See, e.g., ECF No. 78-8 at 2 (counting, based on the\nGovernment\u2019s first status report, (ECF No. 52), 24,805 such employees).) The Government has\nmade no secret of its plan to divest itself of many of them, (see, e.g, ECF No. 1 99 103 & n.1,\n111-13; ECF No. 78-4 at 2-3; ECF No. 78-16 at 2), and has in many cases already taken steps to\ndo so, (see generally ECF Nos. 52-1, 52-2, 103-1 (declarations confirming the firing and post-\nTRO restoration of terminated probationary employees)).\n\nOn top of that, most Plaintiff States have demonstrated, through record evidence, several\nhighly predictable harms resulting from past and future unnoticed RIFs\u2014harms including the loss\nof money, time, and other resources spent on fast-tracking rapid-response efforts and preparing\nunemployment-assistance programs to handle an influx of claims. Based on that evidence as well\nas the allegations of the Complaint\u2014all of which may inform the Court\u2019s decision on whether to\nissue a preliminary injunction, see, e.g., Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 350 & n.1 (1976); G.G. ex\nrel. Grimm v. Gloucester Cnty. Sch. Bd., 822 F.3d 709, 725 (4th Cir. 2016), vacated on other\ngrounds, 580 U.S. 1168 (2017); Wright & Miller, supra, \u00a7 2949 & n.13\u2014there is simply no reason\n\nto think the other five States are not similarly situated and have not been and will not be affected\n\n15\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document125 Filed 04/01/25 Page 18 of 84\n\nin the same ways. See Weaver v. Henderson, 984 F.2d 11, 14 (1st Cir. 1993) (\u201cAt the preliminary\ninjunction stage, it is, after all, the district court\u2019s duty\u2014and its prerogative\u2014to assess the facts,\ndraw whatever reasonable inferences it might favor, and decide the likely ramifications.\u201d (internal\nquotation marks and citation omitted)). This Court will not conjure up implausible scenarios to\nimagine such a reason, anyway\u2014especially not in a posture defined by \u201cprocedures that are less\nformal and evidence that is less complete than in a trial on the merits.\u201d Lackey v. Stinnie, 145 S.\nCt. 659, 667 (2025) (quoting Univ. of Tex. v. Camenisch, 451 U.S. 390, 395 (1981)). Finally, the\nCourt observes that the States\u2019 evidence regarding their asserted injuries is entirely uncontroverted;\nthe Government has supplied no countervailing evidence, nor does it dispute the veracity or\naccuracy of the many declarations the States have provided in support of their requests for\npreliminary relief.\n\nHaving found it likely that each Plaintiff State has experienced or will soon experience the\ninjuries asserted, the Court turns now to why those injuries are legally sufficient injuries in fact.\nIt considers each prong in turn.\n\nii. Concreteness\n\nTo the extent informational injuries have faltered during courts\u2019 injury-in-fact analyses,\nthey have typically done so on the concreteness prong. And indeed, that appears to be the only\nprong on which the Government attacks the States\u2019 asserted harms in this case. (See ECF No. 20\nat 12-17; ECF No. 101 at 12-15.)\n\nUnlike the particularity and actualness-or-imminence prongs, which ask how and whether\nan injury has been felt, see infra Sections III.A.1.iii-iv, the requirement of concreteness goes to\nthe very nature of an alleged harm. It asks, in effect, whether an alleged injury is properly\n\nconsidered an injury at all. See TransUnion, 594 U.S. at 424-25. This demands a harm above and\n\n16\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document125 Filed 04/01/25 Page 19 of 84\n\nbeyond the bare violation of a legal right. Jd. at 425-26. Such an above-and-beyond harm need\nnot be tangible, of course; intangible harms, like an invasion of privacy or the indignity of\ndiscriminatory treatment, have long been recognized as concrete. See, e.g., id. at 425-26\n(collecting cases). But the Supreme Court has been clear that any such harm must bear \u201ca \u2018close\nrelationship\u2019 to a harm \u2018traditionally\u2019 recognized as providing a basis for a lawsuit in American\ncourts,\u201d id. at 424 (quoting Spokeo, 578 U.S. at 341), though it need not be \u201can exact duplicate,\u201d\nid. at 433.\n\nTo satisfy concreteness, a valid informational injury \u201crequires that a [plaintiff] lack access\nto information to which [it] is legally entitled and that the denial of that information create[] a\n\u2018real\u2019 harm with an adverse effect.\u201d Dreher v. Experian Info. Sols., Inc., 856 F.3d 337, 345 (4th\nCir. 2017) (emphasis in original); accord TransUnion, 594 U.S. at 441\u201442 (requiring plaintiffs to\nshow \u201cdownstream consequences\u201d from \u201cfailing to receive... required information\u201d (citation\nomitted)). Where follow-on effects of an information deprivation exist, courts have consistently\nvalidated informational harms as sufficient to establish injury in fact. See, e.g., FEC v. Akins, 524\nU.S. 11, 21 (1998) (follow-on effect of not being able to use information that \u201cwould help\n[plaintiffs] (and others to whom they would communicate it) . . .\u201d); Pub. Citizen v. DOJ, 491 U.S.\n440, 449-51 (1989) (similar); Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 757 n.22 (1984) (consequential\ndignitary harm of receiving false information due to discrimination); Havens Realty Corp. v.\nColeman, 455 U.S. 363, 374-75 (1982) (same); Fernandez v. RentGrow, Inc., 116 F.4th 288, 297\n(4th Cir. 2024) (consequential dignitary harm of having defamatory information published to a\n\n999\n\nthird party). But where \u201c[a]n \u2018asserted informational injury . . . causes no adverse effects,\u2019\u201d courts\n\nhave held that it cannot pass Article III muster. TransUnion, 594 U.S. at 442 (emphasis added)\n\n17\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document125 Filed 04/01/25 Page 20 of 84\n\n(citation omitted); see also RentGrow, 116 F.4th at 295-96, 300 (holding no concrete injury to\nexist absent evidence that a third party had in fact read defamatory material about plaintiff).\n\nHere, nearly all the harms asserted by the Plaintiff States are concrete enough to constitute\ncognizable informational injuries.\n\nFirst, as the Court has explained\u2014and will explain in further detail below, see infra Section\nIV.A.4\u2014\u201cthe plain text of the relevant statutes and regulations makes clear that the States were\nlegally entitled to notice of an imminent RIF.\u201d (TRO Mem. at 16 (citing 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d)(3)(A);\n5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.803(b)).) To date, the Government has not disputed that a lawful RIF requires\nnotice to the States whenever the fifty-person competitive-area threshold is met; rather, the\nGovernment has maintained only that its actions did not actually amount to RIFs. (See ECF No.\n20 at 24-25; ECF No. 101 at 5, 18-19, 23.)\n\nSecond, the States satisfactorily allege or show a variety of consequential harms flowing\nfrom the Defendant Agencies\u2019 failure to give the legally required RIF notice. These consequential\nharms include, most notably, the monetary costs and losses of services associated with the flat-\nfooted, inefficient rollout of States\u2019 rapid-response and unemployment-assistance programs\u2014i.e.,\nharms incurred in an effort to shore up capacity to deliver adequate and timely assistance to the\nsuddenly unemployed, which harms the States say would have been avoided had the Defendant\nAgencies provided the notice mandated by federal law. (See TRO Mem. at 16-17.) Like the Court\nobserved previously, monetary losses are \u201cobvious\u201d concrete harms, as are losses that inexorably\nlead to monetary losses, such as the diversion of resources away from their intended purpose or\nthe loss of the services of an embedded federal employee. (TRO Mem. at 17 (citing TransUnion,\n594 U.S. 413 at 425).) These consequential harms are much more \u201creal\u201d than those held\n\ninsufficient in the past. See, e.g., TransUnion, 594 U.S. at 434 (\u201cThe mere presence of an\n\n18\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document125 Filed 04/01/25 Page 21 of 84\n\ninaccuracy in an internal credit file, if it is not disclosed to a third party, causes no concrete harm.\u201d);\nRentGrow, 116 F.4th at 300 (\u201c[Plaintiff] has failed to demonstrate that the\nmisleading [information] was read and understood, or otherwise considered, by any third\nparty ....\u201d). They are also more \u201creal\u201d than even those harms previously held to be enough. See,\ne.g., Akins, 524 U.S. at 21 (\u201cThere is no reason to doubt [plaintiffs\u2019] claim that the information\nwould help them (and others to whom they would communicate it)... .\u201d); Pub. Citizen v. DOJ,\n491 U.S. 440, 449-50 (1989) (\u201cOur decisions interpreting the Freedom of Information Act have\nnever suggested that those requesting information under it need show more than that they sought\nand were denied specific agency records. There is no reason for a different rule here.\u201d (citations\nomitted)).\n\nAs described above, the States have also alleged or evidenced consequential harms in the\nforms of (1) costs tied to larger payouts of unemployment, health insurance, and other public\nbenefits and (2) economic downturns and eventual decreases in tax revenue brought about by\nhigher numbers of unemployed federal workers. The Court determined earlier that, because the\nStates had already shown two valid theories of concrete injury in fact\u2014those based on already\nrealized financial and labor-related costs\u2014it need not decide the viability of the States\u2019 other\ntheories, which are inherently more predictive and uncertain, even if not fatally so. (See TRO\nMem. at 19-20.)\n\nThe States have since clarified that at least some state income tax revenues have already\nbeen lost because of the unnoticed terminations\u2014specifically, by virtue of certain Defendant\nAgencies having ceased withholding and paying state income taxes to several Plaintiff States. (See\nECF No. 78-1 at 16 n.6); see also supra Section III.A.1.i. The Court is satisfied that this specific\n\nform of tax-revenue injury is real enough to support the concreteness of the States\u2019 asserted\n\n19\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document125 Filed 04/01/25 Page 22 of 84\n\ninformational injury in fact. Otherwise, to the extent the States continue to rely on their earlier\narguments about down-the-road \\ost tax revenues and increased benefits payouts, the Court\nreaffirms what it said before: given the presence of more obviously valid theories of consequential\nharm, the Court need not now decide whether the States\u2019 more speculative harms suffice to make\ntheir informational injuries concrete.\u2019 (See TRO Mem. at 17-20.)\n\nNone of the Government\u2019s counterarguments on concreteness are persuasive. First, it\nargues that \u201csimply pointing to the failure to provide the allegedly required statutory-based notice\nis insufficient for injury.\u201d (ECF No. 101 at 13; see also id. at 14 (\u201cEven assuming that Plaintiffs\u2019\nclaimed[]\u2018statutory right of notice\u2019 alone could give rise to an \u2018informational injury\u2019 that suffices\n\nas an injury-in-fact ....\u201d).) Although the States may have commenced this litigation propounding\n\n\u2019 The Court previously described the issue of the certainty of the States\u2019 consequential harms as one of\nactualness or imminence, not concreteness. (See TRO Mem. at 17.) But the Fourth Circuit has suggested\nthat, despite any nexus with temporality, the certainty of downstream harms is an issue that goes to\nconcreteness, not to actualness or imminence. See RentGrow, 116 F.4th at 299. The Court therefore departs\nfrom its prior TRO analysis only to the extent that the prior analysis described the issue as a potential\nactualness-or-imminence problem.\n\nThe Court also notes that the law is unclear as to exactly how much risk a downstream harm must\npose before it can be said to make a putative informational injury concrete. It is obvious, of course, that\nthe frontline informational injury must be actual or imminent. See, e.g., Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560. But it is\nnot so obvious that the downstream harms must themselves be actual or imminent, or whether some lesser\nlevel of certainty (and if so, what) might suffice. Language from some higher courts suggests the bar might\nbe lower for nested downstream harms. See, e.g., Spokeo, 578 U.S. at 342 (\u201c[N]ot all [alleged informational\ninjuries] cause harm or present any material risk of harm.\u201d (emphasis added)); RentGrow, 116 F.4th at 298\n(\u201cWe don\u2019t doubt that inferences based in customary experience and common sense can be utilized to allege\nand even prove [an essential downstream harm].\u201d); see also id. at 299 (observing that \u201ca substantial and\nimminent risk of future harm may satisfy the concreteness requirement\u201d without indicating whether a lesser\nshowing would be enough). And depending on how low the bar is, the States\u201d increased-benefits-payouts\nand eventual-decreased-tax-revenue theories of consequential harm may ultimately be enough to support\nan informational injury. (See TRO Mem. at 17-20 (noting the \u201cshakier ground\u201d on which those theories\nstand while also stating the increased-benefits-payouts theory likely passes muster, even if the eventual-\ndecreased-tax-revenue theory does not).)\n\nRegardless, having found each State\u2019s informational injury to rest comfortably on downstream\nharms that have already occurred or almost certainly will occur\u2014including but not limited to the short-term\nexpenditures and resource diversions made to accommodate past or impending unnoticed RIFs\u2014the Court\nsees no need to decide at this time whether a lesser level of certainty is enough.\n\n20\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document125 Filed 04/01/25 Page 23 of 84\n\nsuch a theory (in addition to several other theories of injury), (see, e.g., ECF No. 4-1 at 23, 33;\nECF No. 19 at 5\u20146), as has been made clear in both the Court\u2019s TRO Memorandum and the\nPlaintiff States\u2019 subsequent briefing, the States no longer make that argument, (see ECF No. 78-1\nat 15-16), and the Court would be unwilling to accept it in any event, (see TRO Mem. at 15\u201416);\nsee also Dreher, 856 F.3d at 345.\n\nSecond, the Government repeatedly argues that the States\u2019 \u201c\u2018downstream\u2019 theory of injury\nis not viable\u201d under the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in United States v. Texas, 599 U.S. 670 (2023).\nBut its faith in that case is misplaced. For one, a \u201cdownstream\u201d injury\u2014that is, a resulting harm\u2014\nis the crucial second element of a viable informational injury. See TransUnion, 594 U.S. at 442;\nDreher, 856 F.3d at 345. So, to the extent the Government again appears to argue that the fact of\na harm being \u201cdownstream\u201d is fatal to its viability, (see ECF No. 101 at 14), the Court again rejects\nthe argument. (See TRO Mem. at 20 (\u201c[A] \u2018real,\u2019 downstream harm is a critical component of an\ninformational injury\u2014hardly a circumstance that destroys one.\u201d (citations omitted)).)\n\nEven more importantly, Texas simply does not stand for the proposition the Government\nascribes to it. For one, while the Government appears to use Texas to attack the concreteness of\nthe States\u2019 asserted informational injuries, (see ECF No. 101 at 14 (\u201cThe gist of [the] theory in\nTexas was that States could [not] sue based on \u2018downstream\u2019 costs imposed and resources\nexpended in response to a federal government action.\u201d)), Texas is better understood as a case about\n\nredressability and/or the propriety of relief that impinges on core Executive Branch functions.*\n\n* The Court notes dueling conceptions among the justices about how properly to characterize the holding\nin Texas. The majority justified its decision by pointing to the plaintiffs\u2019 lack of a \u201cjudicially cognizable\u201d\ninjury, see 599 U.S. at 676-77, given the judiciary\u2019s ordinary sensitivity to interfering with the Executive\n- Branch\u2019s enforcement discretion as well as a lack of \u201cmeaningful standards for assessing the propriety of\nenforcement choices,\u201d see id. at 679-80. But the majority also rested its determination on the holding of\nLinda R.S. v. Richard D., 410 U.S. 614 (1973), which is a leading redressability case. See 410 U.S. at 618-\n19; see also, e.g., Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env\u2019t, 523 U.S. 83, 106\u201407 (1998). And three justices,\neach concurring in the judgment, separately diagnosed the problem as one of redressability. See 599 U.S.\n\n21\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document125 Filed 04/01/25 Page 24 of 84\n\nSee 599 U.S. at 678 (\u201c[T]his Court\u2019s precedents and longstanding historical practice establish that\nthe States\u2019 suit here is not the kind redressable by a federal court.\u201d). Specifically, it was about\nwhether two plaintiff states had standing to ask \u201cthe Federal Judiciary to order the Department [of\nHomeland Security] to alter its arrest policy so that the Department arrests more noncitizens,\u201d id.\nat 676 (emphasis omitted), on the ground that without such relief, the states would have to, among\nother things, \u201ccontinue to incarcerate or supply social services such as healthcare and education to\nnoncitizens who should be (but are not being) arrested by the Federal Government,\u201d id. at 674.\nThe Supreme Court held that the states did not have standing, citing the well-established principle\nthat \u201ca party \u2018lacks a judicially cognizable interest in the prosecution .. . of another.\u2019\u201d Jd. at 677\n(alteration in original) (quoting Linda R.S. v. Richard D., 410 U.S. 614, 619 (1973)). Among the\ncentral problems was that the states\u2019 alleged injuries \u201car[ose] from the government\u2019s allegedly\nunlawful regulation (or lack of regulation) of someone else,\u201d see id. at 678 (emphasis added)\n(quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 562), making them far less likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial\norder, see id. at 678 & n.2.\n\nThis case is different. Although the Government may wish to describe\u2014and, in fact, has\ndescribed\u2014the States\u2019 harms as \u201caris[ing] from the . . . regulation (or lack of regulation) of\nsomeone else,\u201d see Texas, 599 U.S. at 678, the Court reiterates that this is not a lawsuit about the\nlegality of the Government\u2019s actions from the viewpoint of probationary employees. Rather, it is\n\na suit about the legality of the Government\u2019s actions from the viewpoint of the Plaintiff States,\n\nat 686-93 (Gorsuch, J., concurring). In any event, unlike what the Government suggests, (see ECF No.\n101 at 14), Texas is not a case about concreteness, not least because the word \u201cconcrete\u201d appears just once\nin the majority opinion\u2014ironically, in a paragraph that first notes a situation in which the two states might\nhave been able to show standing, and then lists two of the leading cases on informational injury. See 599\nUS. at 681-82 (citing, inter alia, TransUnion, 594 U.S. at 424-27, and Akins, 524 U.S. at 20).\n\n22\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document125 Filed 04/01/25 Page 25 of 84\n\nwith all\u2014and only\u2014the unique injuries that viewpoint entails. And unlike in Texas, the States\u2019\nasserted injuries are redressable by the relief they seek. See infra Section III.A.3.\n\nEven if the language the Government cites applied to the informational injury at issue here,\nthe Government\u2019s Texas argument still fails to persuade. The Government leans heavily on\nfootnote 3 of that opinion, arguing that a theory of standing based on \u201cindirect effects on state\nrevenues or state spending\u201d is \u201cmore attenuated\u201d and therefore \u201cless likely to succeed.\u201d (See ECF\nNo. 101 at 14 (quoting Texas, 599 U.S. at 680 n.3).) There are two problems with this contention.\nFirst, on its own terms, Texas does not foreclose standing based on \u201cindirect effects\u201d; rather, it\nsays that States \u201csometimes\u201d do have such standing, and that when injuries rest \u201conly [on]...\nindirect effects, [they] can become more attenuated.\u201d 599 U.S. at 680 n.3 (emphasis added).\nSecond, and relatedly, the Government\u2019s contention ignores multiple direct effects the States cite\nas injuries\u2014in particular, the here-and-now expenditures and resource diversions made to ramp\nup state rapid-response and unemployment-assistance programs, the immediate loss of the services\nof federal employees, and the short-term hits to tax revenue based on state income tax not withheld\nfrom now-former federal workers (and therefore not paid to any Plaintiff States). See supra\nSection III.A.1.i.\n\nili. Particularity\n\nA particularized injury is one that \u201caffect[s] the plaintiff in a personal and individual way.\u201d\nSpokeo, 578 U.S. at 339 (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560 n.1). Particularity ensures that an injury\nis personal, not diffuse or \u201cundifferentiated\u2019\u201d\u2014in other words, that the plaintiff has felt an injury\nabove and beyond any experienced by the population at large. See, e.g., United States v.\nRichardson, 418 U.S. 166, 176-77 (1974); Schlesinger v. Reservists Cmte. to Stop the War, 418\n\nU.S. 208, 220-21 (1974).\n\n23\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document125 Filed 04/01/25 Page 26 of 84\n\nThe States easily satisfy this requirement. Their injuries are not injuries felt by the entire\npopulation, like those stemming from the misuse of tax dollars. See, e.g., Richardson, 418 U.S. at\n177. Rather, the States have experienced injuries unique to their status as states, as evinced by the\nvaried but identifiable consequences to state human and financial resources as a result of the\nunnoticed RIFs. See supra Section III.A.1.i. The Government does not argue otherwise. (See\nECF No. 101 at 12-15.)\n\niv. Actualness or Imminence\n\nThe actualness or imminence requirement ensures that a harm has been or will soon be\nrealized. See, e.g., Lujan, 504 U.S. at 563-64. An actual injury is, of course, one that has already\nbeen experienced. By contrast, an imminent injury is one that is \u201ccertainly impending\u201d; a mere\npossibility of future injury is not enough. Clapper, 568 U.S. at 409 (citations omitted).\n\nThe States have established both actual and imminent injuries. The record evidence clearly\nshows the Plaintiff States have already been harmed by the unnoticed RIFs. Indeed, there is\nabsolutely no question as to fifteen of those States, about which there is record evidence that speaks\ndirectly to the injuries they have incurred.? Given the Government\u2019s stated intentions and the\nbreakneck, unwarned nature of its already completed firings (but for the entry of this Court\u2019s\n\nTRO), it is a virtual certainty that all Plaintiff States will soon incur similar injuries again (or for\n\n\u201d For example, nine States\u2014California, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New\nJersey, New Mexico, and New York\u2014have averred costs incurred in beefing up their unemployment-\nassistance programs to handle an influx of claims. Supra Section III.A.1.i. Nine States (Oregon, plus all\nof the previous except Michigan) have averred costs incurred in launching state rapid-response programs\non inadequate information. Jd. Five States\u2014California, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, and\nWashington, D.C.\u2014have felt an immediate loss of tax revenue due to a stoppage in federal income-tax\nwithholding and payment to those jurisdictions. Jd. And five States\u2014California, Washington, D.C.,\nMaryland, Minnesota, and Rhode Island\u2014have shown, either through their own declarations or the\ndeclarations of former federal probationary employees, an increase in unemployment or other public\nbenefits claims. /d. That establishes, at a minimum, the presence of probationary employees, who, in all\nlikelihood, exist in sufficient numbers for each State to need to launch or prepare to launch its rapid-\nresponse effort.\n\n24\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document125 Filed 04/01/25 Page 27 of 84\n\nthe first time, in the unlikely event that, contrary to the allegations of the pleadings as well as the\nobvious inferences to be drawn from the record, some Plaintiff States escaped unscathed from the\nfirst round of unnoticed RIFs).\n\nAt bottom, there is no reason to think the Government will wholly abandon the course of\nconduct that has already injured many Plaintiff States, and it would be myopic, given the breadth\nof the Government\u2019s actions, to conclude that not every Plaintiff State would be affected soon.\nAgain, whether to issue a preliminary injunction entails an exercise of discretion and judgment\u2014\nand, indeed, of the Court\u2019s common sense. See Lackey, 145 S. Ct. at 667. In view of that, the\nCourt need not simply ignore the chaos and uncertainty that has resulted from the Government\u2019s\nconduct. That unpredictability, paired with the strong record evidence of varied, fully realized\nharms as to most States, convinces the Court that, even in the (unlikely) event that not every\nPlaintiff State has yet felt an \u201cactual\u201d injury under Article III, each Plaintiff State has nevertheless\nshown an \u201cimminent\u201d injury sufficient to invoke federal jurisdiction.\n\n2. Traceability\n\nAs the Court explained previously, \u201cit is plain that at least some of the harms the States\nhave experienced\u2014namely, the increase in the cost of administering state programs, irrespective\nof what those programs will be required to pay out\u2014are direct and foreseeable results of the\n[Defendant Agencies\u2019 ] failures to provide RIF notices\u201d to the Plaintiff States. (TRO Mem. at 21\n(emphasis in original).) Now, as then, \u201c\u2018[t]he Government does not argue otherwise.\u201d (/d.)\n\nBecause each Plaintiff State has established by record evidence that it has been or almost\ncertainly will be harmed (at least) vis-a-vis administrative burdens on state rapid-response and/or\nunemployment-assistance programs, see supra Section III.A.1, the Court reaffirms its conclusion\n\nthat each State has met Article III\u2019s causation requirement. It again does not consider whether this\n\n20\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document125 Filed 04/01/25 Page 28 of 84\n\nis also true with respect to the States\u2019 more down-the-road theories of harm, i.e., those based on\nanticipated long-term lost tax revenues and/or economic downturns. Finally, it incorporates by\nreference its prior discussion of why the States\u2019 harms are not self-inflicted or inappropriately\nreliant on the anticipated behavior of third parties. (See TRO Mem. at 22.)\n\n3. Redressability\n\nTo satisfy redressability, \u201cit must be \u2018likely,\u2019 as opposed to merely \u2018speculative,\u2019 that the\ninjury will be \u2018redressed by a favorable decision.\u2019\u201d Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561 (quoting Simon v. E.\nKy. Welfare Rights Org., 426 U.S. 26, 38, 43 (1976)). That does not mean plaintiffs or courts have\ncarte blanche to seek or craft any remedy they desire. \u201cThe remedy must of course be limited to\nthe inadequacy that produced the injury in fact that the plaintiff has established.\u201d Lewis, 518 U.S.\nat 357.\n\nHere, the injury in fact is an informational one. But contrary to what the Government\nargues, (see ECF No. 101 at 4, 14-15), the ultimate harm consists of more than just an absence of\ninformation. In other words, what begins as a lack of information consists, in the end, of both a\nlack of information and the resulting harms. On this point, the Government\u2019s argument is self-\ndefeating: it cannot say, for purposes of injury in fact, that the States need to but fail to invoke\nconsequences other than the initial absence of information, (see id. at 13-14), yet then suggest, for\npurposes of redressability, that the Court should simply ignore any consequences other than the\ninitial absence of information, (see id. at 4, 14-15). The States\u2019 demonstrated downstream harms,\ndetailed extensively above, see supra Sections III.A.1.i-ii, are of course a proper part of the\nredressability analysis. See Madsen v. Women\u2019s Health Center, Inc., 512 U.S. 753, 765 (1994)\n(\u201c[I]njunctive relief should be no more burdensome to the defendant than necessary to provide\n\ncomplete relief to the plaintiffs.\u201d (emphasis added) (citation omitted)).\n\n26\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document125 Filed 04/01/25 Page 29 of 84\n\nOnce the downstream harms are considered, it becomes clear that the Plaintiff States\u2019\ndesired remedy\u2014in relevant part, an injunction that bars future unnoticed RIFs of probationary\nemployees and a stay restoring any unlawfully terminated employees to their positions, (see ECF\nNo. 78 at 1-2)\u2014is both sufficient and necessary to redress the overarching informational injury.\nThe downstream harms stem from the increased pressure on state programs. See supra Section\nIII.A.1.i. Jpso facto, an adequate remedy is one that relieves that pressure. See Lewis, 518 U.S. at\n357. Indeed, although it has since changed its tune, the Government expressly conceded as much\nat the TRO stage. (See ECF No. 20 at 14 (arguing that \u201cthe States\u2019 asserted injuries could only be\nconceivably redressed by [probationary employees\u2019] reinstatement\u201d (emphasis omitted)).) The\nGovernment\u2019s current suggestion that the mere provision of notice would do the trick, (see ECF\nNo. 101 at 4), toggles between naive and disingenuous. Just consider the current state of affairs:\nobviously, the Plaintiff States are now aware of the unnoticed RIFs, but that has hardly relieved\nthe injuries of which they complain. The purpose of the notice provision is to give the States time,\nnot just information. After all, the statute does not merely entitle the States to notice; it entitles\nthem to notice sixty days (or, in extraordinary circumstances, thirty days) of notice in advance so\nthat they can make adequate preparations. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d){e). Merely giving notice at this\njuncture would be insufficient. There must be adequate notice followed by forbearance\u2014no more\nterminations until all legally mandated procedures, including passage of the requisite period of\ntime, have been satisfied.\n\nAlthough the Court has already largely dispensed with the Government\u2019s argument from\nUnited States v. Texas, see supra Section III.A.1.ii, because it arguably raises redressability issues,\nit warrants a second mention here. Simply, the nexus between the injuries and the remedies sought\n\nin this case is much tighter than the connection in Texas, which involved redress for the results of\n\n27\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document125 Filed 04/01/25 Page 30 of 84\n\n\u201cthe Executive Branch\u2019s alleged failure to make more arrests or bring more prosecutions.\u201d 599\nU.S. at 681. In other words, the two plaintiff states in Texas hoped that a court order telling the\nExecutive Branch to beef up its enforcement would lead to trickle-down ameliorative effects on\nthe states\u2019 fiscs. See id. at 676-79. Under the redressability rule announced in Linda R.S., that\nwas not enough. See 410 U.S. at 618 (\u201cThe prospect that prosecution will, at least in the future,\nresult in payment . . . can, at best, be termed only speculative.\u201d). While that level of speculation\nmay describe a small subset of the States\u2019 asserted injuries in this action\u2014namely, the long-term\nlosses of tax revenue about which the Court expressed skepticism in the TRO Memorandum, (see\nTRO Mem. at 17\u201419)\u20141t certainly does not describe the mine run of their injuries, which would\ndoubtless be redressed by an order restoring the state of affairs to one in which the States were not\ntrying to catch up to accommodate the Government\u2019s breakneck firings.\n\nFinally, the Government seeks to distinguish the case of Laufer v. Naranda Hotels, LLC,\n60 F.4th 156 (4th Cir. 2023), a decision it argues the Court improperly \u201crelied upon\u201d in its TRO\nMemorandum. (ECF No. 101 at 15.) This is a puzzling argument. For one, the Court cited Laufer\nfor just two propositions: first, that Article III requires a \u201cgenuine, live dispute between adverse\nparties,\u201d (TRO Mem. at 14 (ultimately quoting Carney v. Adams, 592 U.S. 53, 58 (2020)), and\nsecond, that other courts have repeatedly recognized informational injury as a valid injury in fact,\nas signaled by a \u201ccollecting cases\u201d parenthetical, (see id. at 16). In other words, the Court cited\nLaufer not for its own conclusions but for things that ofher cases said. On top of that, the\nGovernment appears to suggest the Court used Laufer to explain how the States\u2019 harms were\nredressable. (See ECF No. 101 at 15.) But this is just the Texas problem in reverse: instead of\nLaufer being about redressability, which even the Government concedes it was not, (id. at 15\n\n(explaining that the Fourth Circuit in Laufer \u201cobserved that the defendant had not even contested\n\n28\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document125 Filed 04/01/25 Page 31 of 84\n\nredressability in district court\u201d)), Laufer is primarily about concreteness. See, e.g., 60 F.4th at\n168-71 (discussing TransUnion, 594 U.S.). And as discussed above, concreteness is no issue for\nthe States. See supra Section IILA.1.ii.\n\nFor the reasons stated above and in the TRO Memorandum, (TRO Mem. at 14\u201423), the\nCourt again concludes that the Plaintiff States have demonstrated\u2014with the degree of proof\nappropriate for the preliminary injunction stage\u2014that they have standing to pursue this relief in\nthis Court.\n\nB. Jurisdiction\n\nIn its decision granting the States\u2019 request for a TRO, the Court held that the challenged\nactions were final agency actions within the meaning of the APA, and thus within the Court\u2019s\njurisdiction to review, (see TRO Mem. at 23-25), and that Congress\u2019s decision to divert certain\nemployee- and union-related actions into a comprehensive administrative review scheme did not\ndivest this Court of its federal-question jurisdiction over the States\u2019 claims, (see id. at 25-32).\n\nThe Court continues to conclude that there is no jurisdictional defect that would divest it\nof its power to adjudicate this action. It addresses both topics in turn below.\n\n1. Final Agency Action\n\nThe APA limits judicial review to final agency action. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 704. And because the\nAPA\u2019s judicial-review provision effects a partial waiver of the federal government\u2019s sovereign\nimmunity, and because sovereign immunity is jurisdictional in nature, \u201cfinality under the APA is\na jurisdictional requirement.\u201d Jake's Fireworks Inc. v. U.S. Cons. Prod. Safety Comm'n, 105 F 4th\n\n627, 631 (4th Cir. 2024) (cleaned up).\n\n29\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document125 Filed 04/01/25 Page 32 of 84\n\nThe Court continues to conclude that the actions at issue here\u2014past or anticipated mass\nfirings of probationary employees without statutorily required notice\u2014are final agency actions.!\u00b0\nIt incorporates by reference its analysis from the TRO Memorandum. (See TRO Mem. at 23-25.)\nAs the Court explained therein, the firing (with or without notice to affected States) of a\nprobationary employee is both \u201cagency action\u201d and \u201cfinal\u201d within the meaning of the APA. (id.\nat 24 (citing Whitman vy, Am. Trucking Ass \u2019ns, 531 U.S. 457, 478 (2001); Burdue v. FAA, 774 F.3d\n1076, 1080 (6th Cir. 2014).) The Court thus has jurisdiction to review the States\u2019 APA claims, at\nleast insofar as they concern the unnoticed terminations.\n\nAt the TRO stage, the Government did not dispute this conclusion. (See generally ECF\nNo. 20.) And it barely does so now, having made only a vague reference during the preliminary\ninjunction hearing to its position that the States could not specifically identify from which future\nfinal agency actions they sought relief. This, of course, is unpersuasive. The Government has,\nwithout notice, conducted mass firings of federal probationary employees. The States fear it will\ndo so again. Because the whole point of this lawsuit is to determine the legal consequences, if\nany, of the Government\u2019s choice to act without notice, the Court could hardly expect the States to\npoint to specific future unwarned terminations of which they hope to be notified. Obviously, the\n\nfuture actions the States seek to enjoin are those that match the final agency actions from which\n\nthe States seek immediate relief.\n\n'\u00b0 Tn its TRO Memorandum, the Court concluded that the \u201cnub of this lawsuit is the lack of notice the States\nreceived\u201d with respect to actual or imminent mass terminations. (TRO Mem. at 23.) And because that\nnotice must issue from any individual Defendant Agency that conducts terminations within the meaning of\nthe RIF laws, (see id. at 23-24 (citing 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.803(b)), the relevant actions for purposes of the TRO\ndecision were the unnoticed firings themselves, not any upstream directive from OPM that may or may not\nhave directed those firings. (See id.) Because this rationale applies with equal force at the preliminary\ninjunction stage, the Court again focuses solely on the unnoticed firings by each Defendant Agency\n(including OPM) of its own employees, rather than any directive from OPM. (See id.)\n\n30\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document125 Filed 04/01/25 Page 33 of 84\n\n2: Claim Channeling\n\nIn its TRO Memorandum, the Court held that, pursuant to the analytical scheme set out in\nThunder Basin Coal Co. v. Reich, 510 U.S. 200 (1994), there was no reason to believe Congress\nhad divested the district courts of jurisdiction over the States\u2019 claims in this case. (See generally\nTRO Mem. at 25-32.) The Court incorporates its prior analysis by reference. What follows is a\nsummary of that analysis as well as the Court\u2019s analysis of the parties\u2019 newest arguments.\n\nThunder Basin sets out a two-step framework to assess whether Congress divested the\ndistrict courts of jurisdiction to hear challenges to federal agency action. See 510 U.S. at 207-13;\nAxon Enter., Inc. v. FTC, 598 U.S. 175, 185-86 (2023). At the first step, a court considers whether\na statutory scheme\u2014as evinced by its \u201ctext, structure, and purpose\u201d\u2014reveals an intent to divert\nsome agency-action claims away from the district courts\u2019 federal-question jurisdiction (under 28\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1331) and into administrative review by an agency. See Bennett v. SEC, 844 F.3d 174,\n181 (4th Cir. 2016); Axon, 598 U.S. at 185. If so, the court moves to the second step, which asks\n\u201cwhether the statutory review scheme, though exclusive where it applies, reaches the claim[s] in\nquestion.\u201d See Axon, 598 U.S. at 186. This requires courts to apply the three so-called Thunder\nBasin factors: (1) whether precluding district-court jurisdiction would \u201cforeclose all meaningful\njudicial review\u201d of the claims, (2) whether the claims are \u201cwholly collateral to [the] statute\u2019s review\nprovisions,\u201d and (3) whether the claims are directed to issues \u201coutside the agency\u2019s expertise.\u201d\n(TRO Mem. at 26 (quoting Axon, 598 U.S. at 186 (alteration in original)).) \u201cWhen the answer to\nall three questions is yes, the court presumes that Congress does not intend to limit jurisdiction,\nthough a claim may be judicially reviewable even if the factors point in different directions.\u201d (Jd.\n\n(cleaned up) (quoting Axon, 598 U.S. at 186).)\n\n31\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document125 Filed 04/01/25 Page 34 of 84\n\nAt the TRO stage, the Court concluded that the answer at step one was \u201cyes,\u201d the federal\nstatutory scheme did evince a congressional intent to carve some agency-action claims out of the\nCourt\u2019s typical federal-question jurisdiction. (See TRO Mem. at 26-27 (quoting Nat'l Treasury\nEmps. Union v. Trump, Civ. No. CRC-25-420, 2025 WL 561080, at *4\u20145 (D.D.C. Feb. 20, 2025)).)\nThe relevant scheme is that set out in the Civil Service Reform Act (\u201cCSRA\u201d), Pub. L. No. 95-\n454, \u00a7 701, 92 Stat. 1111, 1191-216 (1978) (codified at 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7101-35), which provides for\nthe original and exclusive administrative review of certain labor- and employment-related claims\nbrought by federal employees and/or their unions. (See id.)\n\nAt step two, however, the Court concluded that the answer was \u201cno,\u201d the CSRA scheme\ndid not reach the States\u2019 claims in this case.'' (TRO Mem. at 27-32.) On the first and \u201cmost\nimportant\u201d factor, whether there is meaningful judicial review, see Bennett, 844 F.3d at 183 n.7\n(collecting cases), the Court determined that the States\u2019 claims could not be reviewed \u201cin any\nrelevant setting\u201d\u2014not in an administrative agency as an original matter, much less on appeal to a\nfederal appellate court. (See TRO Mem. at 28-29.) On the second factor, collaterality to the\n\nstatute\u2019s review provisions, the Court likewise held in favor of the States, concluding that the\n\n'! The States insist that they win on step one, i.e., that the Court need not even proceed to step two because\n\u201cthe CSRA does not display a \u2018fairly discernible\u2019 intent to limit jurisdiction over the States\u2019 claims.\u201d (ECF\nNo. 78-1 at 17 (quoting Elgin v. Dep\u2019t of Treasury, 567 U.S. 1, 10 (2012)); see also ECF No. 19 at 7.) This\nmisapprehends Thunder Basin. The identities of claimants and the nature of their claims are discussed at\nstep two, not step one. See Axon, 598 U.S. at 185-86 (\u201cAfter finding that Congress\u2019s creation of a\n\u2018comprehensive review process\u2019. .. oust[s] [the] district courts of jurisdiction, the Court ask[s] another\nquestion: whether the particular claims brought [a]re \u2018of the type Congress intended to be reviewed within\nthis statutory structure.\u2019\u201d (emphasis added) (quoting Thunder Basin, 510 U.S. at 208, 212)). Step one asks\nonly whether a scheme purports to be exclusive over certain claims, thus divesting the district courts of\nsome of their usual jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331, while step two explores what, exactly, those certain\nclaims are. See id.; Am. Fed\u2019n of Gov't Emps., AFL-CIO y. OPM, Civ. No. WHA-25-1780, 2025 WL\n900057, at *1 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 24, 2025). But see Koretoff v. Vilsack, 614 F.3d 532, 536 (D.C. Cir. 2010)\n(Kavanaugh, J.) (suggesting, based on a pre-7hunder Basin decision, that \u201cwhether Congress \u2018foreclosed\nreview to the class to which the [plaintiff] belong[s]\u2019\u201d is a step-one question). To adopt the States\u2019 approach\nwould be to ask the same questions at both stages of the analysis.\n\nae\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document125 Filed 04/01/25 Page 35 of 84\n\nStates\u2019 harms were sufficiently distinct from the employee- and union-focused harms Congress\nintended to channel away from the district courts. (See id. at 29-30.) And on the third factor, the\nquestion of agency expertise, the States once again prevailed (albeit on a \u201ccloser call\u201d), as there\nwas little reason to think that agencies like the Merit Systems Protection Board, the Federal Labor\nRelations Authority, and the Office of Special Counsel\u2014entities ordinarily tasked with reviewing\nbread-and-butter employment disputes and issues of \u201cemployer-agency policy choices,\u201d see Am.\nFed\u2019n of Gov't Emps., AFL-CIO v. OPM, Civ. No. WHA-25-1780, 2025 WL 900057, at *2 (N.D.\nCal. Mar. 24, 2025)\u2014held any special expertise about the notice owed to states before conducting\naRIF. (See TRO Mem. at 30.)\n\nFinally, the Court rejected the Government\u2019s remaining counterargument\u2014that because\nthe fired employees could themselves seek administrative redress, there was no need or option to\nretain jurisdiction over the States\u2019 claims\u2014as relying, once again, on the faulty premise that the\nStates were simply trying to vindicate the interests of the terminated workers (as opposed to their\nown and separate harms as \u201cstates qua states\u201d). (See TRO Mem. at 30-31.) The Court then\nexpressed its skepticism that terminated employees would or even could adequately represent the\nStates\u2019 unique interests, let alone at a scale that would actually remedy the States\u2019 asserted injuries.\n(See id. at 31.) In short, the Government supplied no compelling reasons for the Court to hold that\nthe States\u2019 claims were of the \u201crare[]\u201d type Congress has \u201callow[ed] . . . to escape effective judicial\nreview.\u201d (See id. (quoting Axon, 598 U.S. at 186).)\n\nThe Government\u2019s new arguments offer no reason to reach a different result. In essence,\nthe Government continues to argue that the fired employees are \u201cthe real parties in interest,\u201d (ECF\nNo. 101 at 16), and that, even if they were not, the unavailability of redress for the States\u2019 harms\n\nis not a problem because it simply reflects Congress\u2019s choice to limit redress to employees and\n\n33\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document125 Filed 04/01/25 Page 36 of 84\n\ntheir unions, (see id. at 16-18). But, in the Government\u2019s words, \u201c[t]hat has it backwards.\u201d (See\nid. at 16.) The CSRA is about where employees and unions must go to press claims relevant to\nthem, and them alone. See, e.g., Fornaro v. James, 416 F.3d 63, 67 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (Roberts, J.)\n(\u201c[S]o far as review of [individual benefits] determinations under the CSRA is concerned, what\nyou get under the CSRA is what you get.\u201d). The CSRA is not about where States may go to press\nwholly distinct claims based on wholly distinct injuries.\n\nFor that reason, the Government\u2019s citations to various cases for the proposition that the\nCSRA offers a limited review scheme\u2014a statement with which the Court agrees\u2014tring hollow.\nEach cited case involved a suit brought by employees or unions over employee or union problems.\n(See ECF No. 101 at 16-17 (first citing Elgin v. Dep't of Treasury, 567 U.S. 1 (2012) (employees\nsuing over their dismissal for failure to register for the Selective Service, id. at 67); then citing\nAm. Fed\u2019n of Gov't Emps v. Sec\u2019y of the Air Force, 716 F.3d 633 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (unions and one\nemployee suing over military uniform requirements, id. at 635); then citing 4m. Fed\u2019n of Gov't\nEmps. v. Trump, 929 F.3d 748 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (unions suing over changes to federal labor-\nmanagement relations scheme, id. at 752-53); then citing Fornaro v. James, 416 F.3d 63 (D.C.\nCir. 2005) (Roberts, J.) (employees suing over disability benefits, id. at 67); then citing Grosdidier\nv. Chairman, Broad. Bd. of Governors, 560 F.3d 495 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (employees suing over being\ndenied promotions)); then citing United States v. Fausto, 484 U.S. 439 (1988) (employee suing\nover individual disciplinary action); and then citing Pinar v. Dole, 747 F.2d 899 (4th Cir. 1984)\n(same)).) And none of those cases suggests the CSRA is exclusive (much less preclusive, as the\nGovernment argues here) as to parties other than (1) unions or employees (2) bringing garden-\nvariety labor or employment claims. See Elgin, 567 U.S. at 5 (\u201cUnder the [CSRA], certain federal\n\nemployees may obtain administrative and judicial review of specified adverse employment\n\n34\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document125 Filed 04/01/25 Page 37 of 84\n\nactions.\u201d); Sec'y of the Air Force, 716 F.3d at 636 (explaining that the CSRA offers \u201cparticular\nforums and procedures for particular kinds of claims\u201d as well as the \u201cexclusive avenue for suit to\na plaintiff whose claims fall within its scope\u201d (citations and internal quotation marks omitted));\nTrump, 929 F.3d at 755 (explaining that the CSRA \u201cprovides the exclusive procedures by which\nfederal employees and their bargaining representatives may assert federal labor-management\nrelations claims\u201d (citations omitted)); Fornaro, 416 F.3d at 66-69 (similar); Grosdidier, 560 F.3d\nat 497 (\u201cThe CSRA protects covered federal employees . . . and it supplies a variety of causes of\naction and remedies to employees when their rights under the statute are violated. ... Federal\nemployees may not circumvent the Act\u2019s requirements and limitations by resorting to the catchall\nAPA to challenge agency employment actions.\u201d); Fausto, 484 U.S. at 445 (explaining that the\nCSRA was \u201cdesigned to balance the legitimate interests of the various categories of federal\nemployees with the needs of sound and efficient administration\u201d); Pinar, 747 F.2d at 907\u201408\n(similar).\n\nCuriously, in its brief opposing the issuance of a preliminary injunction, the Government\nwholly abandons Thunder Basin (on which it relied heavily at the TRO stage, (see ECF No. 20 at\n17\u201423)) and opts instead to rely on a different case, Block v. Community Nutrition Institute, 467\nU.S. 340 (1984). But in the claim-channeling line of authority, Block does not represent some\nindependent analytical framework separate and apart from Thunder Basin, but rather is a precursor\ndecision to Thunder Basin, as Thunder Basin itself suggests. See 510 U.S. at 207, 216 (citing\nBlock). Even more tellingly, in Axon, the last major word on the topic of administrative\nexclusivity, a unanimous Supreme Court did not mention Block at all. See 598 U.S. passim.\n\nNotwithstanding what appears to an effort by the Government to avoid Thunder Basin,\n\nBlock is distinguishable. The Government is correct that, in Block, a statute that authorized dairy\n\n35\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document125 Filed 04/01/25 Page 38 of 84\n\nhandlers and producers to seek review of certain \u201cmarket orders\u201d neglected to create a similar\nprovision for dairy consumers, which led the Supreme Court to conclude that Congress intended\n\u201cto limit the classes entitled to participate in the development of market orders.\u201d See Block, 467\nU.S. at 346-47. But unlike the statute at issue in Block, the RIF requirements do not contemplate\na \u201ccooperative venture\u201d in which Congress \u201cintended for [a particular] class to be relied upon to\nchallenge agency disregard of the law\u201d and \u201censure that the statutory objectives would be\nrealized.\u201d See id. There is no reason to think Congress expected federal employees to police the\nGovernment\u2019s compliance with its duty to provide notice to affected states (despite any role the\nemployees may have regarding notice they themselves are owed, see 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d)(1)(A); 5\nC.F.R. \u00a7 351.801(a)), much less do so with the same vigor and precision as a state would, given\nthe relative disunity of the two groups\u2019 interests.\n\nMoreover, insofar as Block relied on the fact that handlers and producers were expressly\npermitted to participate while consumers were not, its holding was based on the friction that would\nresult from allowing one group to raise \u201cprecisely the same\u201d claims in federal court that another\ngroup \u201cmust raise administratively.\u201d See Block, 467 U.S. at 348. Here, the potential claims of any\nemployees are fundamentally different than those brought by the States, and there is no such\nfriction. And \u201cwhile certain facts are common to the States\u2019 action and any administrative actions\nthat might be brought by terminated employees, the States\u2019 interests remain substantially different\nfrom the employees\u2019, as evinced by the presence of harms that only states qua states can\nexperience.\u201d (TRO Mem. at 31.)\n\nFinally, even though the States are not mentioned in the CSRA, unlike the plaintiffs in\nBlock, they are explicitly mentioned in the laws that supply the relevant standard of conduct for\n\nthe Government (i.e., RIF statutes and regulations). See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d)(3)(A)(i); 5 C.F.R.\n\n36\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document125 Filed 04/01/25 Page 39 of 84\n\n\u00a7 351.803(b)(1). Accordingly, the States have interests in and protections under those laws. See\ninfra Section IV.A.1.\n\nIn the end, the Government\u2019s claim-channeling arguments rely crucially on the idea that\nthere is an identity of interests between the States and the fired employees. But that is not so. And\nwhile the Government has amply argued that the CSRA is an exclusive review scheme, it has\nshown this only in the specific context of claims brought by employees or their unions over\nemployee or union matters. The Court thus reaffirms its jurisdiction over the States\u2019 claims.\n\nIV. PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION ANALYSIS\n\nHaving determined that nothing changes the Court\u2019s prior conclusion that it has jurisdiction\nto hear this case, the Court turns to the factors necessary for issuance of a preliminary injunction.\n\nThe party seeking a preliminary injunction \u201cmust establish that he is likely to succeed on\nthe merits, that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, that the\nbalance of equities tips in his favor, and that an injunction is in the public interest.\u201d Winter, 555\nU.S. at 20 (citations omitted). A preliminary injunction is \u201can extraordinary remedy that may only\nbe awarded upon a clear showing that the plaintiff is entitled to such relief.\u201d /d. at 22.\n\nThe Court concludes that the States have established all four factors, and that a preliminary\ninjunction is warranted.\n\nA. Likelihood of Success on the Merits\n\nThe States continue to show they are very likely to succeed on the merits of their APA\ncontrary-to-law claim. The Court incorporates by reference its prior analysis on this issue, (see\nTRO Mem. at 32-42), and provides additional analysis below.\n\n1. Zone of Interests\n\nAs the Court stated in its TRO Memorandum,\n\n37\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document125 Filed 04/01/25 Page 40 of 84\n\n[u|nder the APA, a court shall \u201chold unlawful and set aside agency action. . . found\n\nto be. . . arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance\n\nwith law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A). For purposes of a contrary-to-law claim, the legal\n\nstandards against which the federal government\u2019s conduct is assessed are supplied\n\nnot by the APA itself, but by a separate statute\u2014in this case, the RIF statute, 5\n\nU.S.C, $3502.\n(TRO Mem. at 32-33.) It also explained that a plaintiff suing under a statutory right of action\nmust show that its interests are \u201carguably within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated\u201d\nby the statute. (/d. at 33 (quoting Match-E\u2014Be\u2014Nash\u2014She\u2014Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians v.\nPatchak, 567 U.S. 209, 224 (2012) (emphasis omitted).) The Court concluded that the Plaintiff\nStates easily make this showing, as their \u201cinterests in this case strike at the very heart of the RIF\nprovisions.\u201d (/d.)\n\nThe Government does not object to the Court\u2019s analysis of this issue now, and the Court\nsees no reason to revisit its prior conclusions. Accordingly, the Court continues to hold that the\nPlaintiff States are within the zone of interests of the RIF statute, for the reasons stated in the TRO\n\nMemorandum. (See TRO Mem. at 33-34.)\n\n2. Termination of Probationary Employees\n\nIn its Opposition to the Preliminary Injunction Motion, the Government argues for the first\ntime that the three methods previously outlined by the Court are not the only ways to terminate\nprobationary employees. The Court finds the Government\u2019s arguments on this score unavailing.\n\nAs the Court previously explained, there are three circumstances under which probationary\nemployees may be terminated. A probationary employee may be individually terminated either\n\u201cbecause his work performance or conduct during th[e probationary] period fails to demonstrate\nhis fitness or his qualifications for continued employment,\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.804, or else \u201cfor reasons\nbased in whole or in part on conditions arising before his appointment,\u201d id. \u00a7 315.805. Otherwise,\n\na probationary employee may be terminated as part of a RIF. See id. \u00a7 315.202. The Court put\n\n38\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document125 Filed 04/01/25 Page 41 of 84\n\nthe question of alternative termination methods to the Government during the TRO Hearing, and\nthe Government did not specifically identify any additional methods by which a probationary\nemployee could be terminated. (See ECF No. 48 at 34-36 (arguing only that \u201c[t]here may be\nadditional provisions of Title 5 that allow for termination of employees\u201d).)\n\nNow, the Government argues that these three methods are not exhaustive, explaining that\n\u201cOPM\u2019s regulations, 5 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 315.803(a), 315.804, and 315.805, do not purport to be\nexclusive,\u201d and that \u201cOPM regulations governing probationary employees do not limit agencies\u2019\nauthority to remove probationary employees for non-performance-based reasons.\u201d (ECF No. 101\nat 20.) The Government is correct that these regulations do not expressly state that they are\nexclusive, but where the relevant regulations provide for three very specific ways of terminating\nprobationary employees, it makes little sense to read in a separate, general, and unlimited method\nof termination, which would simply subsume and render superfluous the enumerated methods.\n\nThe Government separately points to 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.803(a) as providing \u201cindependent\nauthority, separate from the RIF regulations, for agencies to terminate competitive service\nprobationary employees if the agency decides that paying their salary is unwarranted given the\nagency\u2019s current priorities.\u201d (ECF No. 101 at 21.) But the Government misreads the regulation.\nThat provision, titled \u201cAgency action during probationary period (general),\u201d provides that \u201c[t]he\nagency shall utilize the probationary period as fully as possible to determine the fitness of the\nemployee and shall terminate his or her services during this period if the employee fails to\ndemonstrate fully Ais or her qualifications for continued employment.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.803(a)\n(emphasis added). The very next section explains how an agency can terminate a probationary\nemployee in such a circumstance (i.e., when an employee \u201cfails to demonstrate his fitness or his\n\nqualifications\u201d). See id. \u00a7 315.804(a) (\u201c[W]hen an agency decides to terminate an employee\n\n39\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document125 Filed 04/01/25 Page 42 of 84\n\nserving a probationary or trial period because his work performance or conduct during this period\nfails to demonstrate his fitness or his qualifications for continued employment, it shall terminate\nhis services by notifying him in writing as to why he is being separated and the effective date of\nthe action. The information in the notice as to why the employee is being terminated shall, as a\nminimum, consist of the agency\u2019s conclusions as to the inadequacies of his performance or\nconduct.\u201d (emphasis added)).\n\nThe Government also argues generally that \u201cagencies have broad discretion to remove\nprobationary employees\u201d and that \u201cthe CSRA preserved agencies\u2019 broad authority to terminate\nprobationary employees, and [the States] must identify some statutory constraint to prevail\u2014\nwhich they have not done.\u201d (ECF No. 101 at 22.) While it is true that agencies have discretion to\nterminate employees, this discretion is available only in the context of the three authorized methods\n\nfor terminating probationary employees, as previously discussed.'\u201d\n\n'\u00b0 The Government cites Yu v. Dep\u2019t of Army, 28 F. App\u2019x 968 (Fed. Cir. 2002), for the proposition that\n\u201cthe agency need not show unsatisfactory performance in order to discontinue employment during a\nprobationary period; the only grounds for appeal are those set in 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.806(b}{c) and\n\u00a7 1201.3(a)(8).\u201d (ECF No. 101 at 21 (quoting Yu, 28 F. App\u2019x at 971).) That case is inapposite. It is true\nthat probationary employees\u2019 ability to appeal for-cause termination decisions is tightly constrained.\nIndeed, 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.806 provides that a probationary employee may appeal for-cause terminations (i.e.,\nterminations conducted pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 315.804 or 315.805) only when \u201che or she alleges [the termination\nwas] based on partisan political reasons or marital status,\u201d or, if the termination was conducted pursuant to\n\u00a7 315.805, if the appeal is on the basis \u201cthat his termination was not effected in accordance with the\nprocedural requirements of that section.\u201d However, this case is not about whether an individual employee\nmay appeal a termination; this case is about whether the Government conducted RIFs not in accordance\nwith statutory and regulatory state-notice requirements.\n\nThe Government also takes issue with the Court\u2019s citation to McGuffin v. Soc. Sec. Admin., 942\nF.3d 1099 (Fed. Cir. 2019), for the proposition that an employer \u201cmust honestly be dissatisfied with the\nprobationer\u2019s conduct or performance after giving him a fair trial on the job.\u201d (See ECF No. 101 at 23 n.4.)\nThe Government explains that the case involves the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment\nRights Act (\u201cUSERRA\u201d), a statute not at issue here, and that McGuffin is therefore irrelevant. (/d.) It is\ntrue that McGuffin discussed USERRA. However, the Government appears to ignore the immediately\npreceding citation in that case to 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.804 as well as the context of the case to which McGuffin\nrefers in that discussion. The full quote is:\n\nAn employer may terminate an individual during his probationary period if the individual\n\u201cfails to demonstrate his fitness or his qualifications for continued employment... .\u201d 5\nC.F.R. \u00a7 315.804(a). The employer, however, \u201cmust honestly be dissatisfied with the\n\n40\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document125 Filed 04/01/25 Page 43 of 84\n\nThe evidence in this case flatly belies the Government\u2019s assertion that it relied upon some\nadditional, overarching discretion to fire probationary employees in this case. This is simply a\npost-hoc rationalization, and \u201cpost hoc rationalizations of the agency or the parties to this litigation\ncannot serve as a sufficient predicate for agency action.\u201d Am. Textile Mfrs. Inst., Inc. v. Donovan,\n452 U.S. 490, 539 (1981). Nearly every termination letter in the record reflects that the\nterminations purport to be for-cause terminations pursuant to the regulations cited above. Some\nletters explicitly reference those regulations. For instance, a Small Business Administration letter\nstates that, \u201cin accordance with Title 5 of the Code of Federal Regulations \u00a7 315.804, ... your\nemployment... is being terminated.\u201d (ECF No. 33-18 at 6; see also ECF No. 33-1 at 6\n(Department of Transportation termination letter explicitly referencing 5 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 315.803 and\n804); ECF No. 33-2 at 7-8 (Department of Health and Human Services termination letter explicitly\nreferencing 5 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 315.803, 315.804, and 315.806); ECF No. 33-6 at 7 (same for Department\nof Labor); ECF No. 33-8 at 7-8 (same for Department of Education); ECF No. 33-9 at 7-8 (same\nfor Department of the Treasury); ECF No. 33-10 at 6 (same for the IRS); ECF No. 33-11 at 8\n(FEMA termination letter explicitly referencing 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.806); ECF No. 33-12 at 7-8\n\n(Department of Education terminated letter explicitly referencing 5 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 315.804 and\n\nprobationer\u2019s conduct or performance after giving him a fair trial on the job.\u201d Shaw vy.\nUnited States, 622 F.2d 520, 544 (Ct.

The Court in Shaw, the case cited in McGuffin, stated\u2014in its discussion of 5\nC.F.R. \u00a7 315.804\u20141that \u201c[s]ubstantively, the only limitation on an agency\u2019s power to dismiss a probationary\nemployee is that the agency must honestly be dissatisfied with the probationer\u2019s conduct or performance\nafter giving him a fair trial on the job,\u201d 622 F.2d at 544 (citation omitted)\u2014the same proposition for which\nthis Court originally cited McGuffin.\n\nIt appears that the Government is indirectly taking the position that an agency need not be honestly\ndissatisfied with a probationary employee to fire them for cause. The Court will not endorse this view,\nwhich would render meaningless the requirement that the termination be based on the employee\u2019s \u201cfitness\u201d\nor \u201cqualifications.\u201d See 5 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 315.803(a), .804(a).\n\n41\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document125 Filed 04/01/25 Page 44 of 84\n\n315.806).) Others reference them more obliquely. (See, e.g., ECF No. 33-3 at 7 (USAID\ntermination letter explaining that, \u201c[i]f you believe this action resulted from discrimination based\non marital status or partisan political reasons, or because of conditions arising before your\nappointment, you may appeal this action,\u201d a clear reference to 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.806); ECF No. 33-\n5 at 8 (similar for the Department of the Interior); ECF No. 33-7 at 8 (similar for GSA)). The\nGovernment cannot now credibly argue that the Defendant Agencies were relying on some other\nauthority to effectuate these terminations.\n\n3, The Defendant Agencies Conducted RIFs\n\nEven if there were some additional method by which the Defendant Agencies could\nterminate probationary employees,'? the Court continues to find that they conducted RIFs, and\nfully incorporates and adopts its prior analysis with respect to this finding. (See TRO Mem. 34\u2014\n41.) In addition to the evidence previously cited by the Court, new information entered into the\nrecord since the TRO was issued confirms and strengthens the Court\u2019s conclusion that RIFs\noccurred. The Court also concludes that RIFs occurred at three additional Defendant Agencies.\n\nAs the Court previously explained in its TRO Memorandum, the relevant regulations\n\nprovide that \u201c[e]ach agency shall follow this part when it releases a competing employee from his\n\n'S The Government also argues that 5 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 315.803(a) and 315.804(a) \u201c[b]y their terms . . . do not\napply to excepted service probationary employees\u201d and apply only to competitive service probationary\nemployees. (ECF No. 101 at 21 n.2.) However, confusingly, the record reflects that at least one termination\nletter relates to an excepted service position, but references 5 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 315.803 and 315.804. (See ECF\nNo. 33-9 at 7; id. (also referencing 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 316.304, which provides that \u201c[t]he agency may terminate a\nterm employee at any time during the trial period\u201d and that \u201c[t]he employee is entitled to the procedures set\nforth in \u00a7 315.804 or \u00a7 315.805 of this chapter as appropriate\u201d).)\n\nIn any event, assuming that excepted service probationary employees can be terminated for\nessentially any reason, this does not change the Court\u2019s analysis. Regardless of any method by which a\nDefendant Agency could terminate a probationary employee, as the Court explained in detail in its TRO\nMemorandum and herein, the Defendant Agencies conducted RIFs. And the RIF regulations apply to\nexcepted service employees. See 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.202 (providing that the RIF regulations apply to \u201ceach\ncivilian employee in. . .

Under that definition, the evidence reflects that these\nterminations were essentially reorganizations (even if the Government does not label them as\nsuch), which means they trigger the RIF requirements.\n\nOn some occasions, the Defendant Agencies themselves referred to the actions as RIFs.\nFor instance, a termination email from GSA directed a terminated employee to \u201cdirect [their]\ninquiries to rif@gsa.gov.\u201d (ECF No. 78-12 at 2.) And a declaration from an employee of the\nAmerican Federation of Government Employees explains that he reviewed the termination letters\nof a USAID employee, including one the employee had received \u201con February 23, 2025, which...\n\nexplained that the RIF was being taken [pursuant to] applicable to \u2018civil service RIF regulations.\u2019\u201d\n\nambit employees \u201c[i]n a position in the Senior Executive Service\u201d or \u201c[w]hose appointment is required by\nCongress to be confirmed by, or made with the advice and consent of, the United States Senate, except a\npostmaster.\u201d). The Government does not argue otherwise.\n\n43\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document125 Filed 04/01/25 Page 46 of 84\n\n(ECF No. 78-10 \u00a7 17.) That employee then received a termination letter the next day \u201cindicating\n[that] she was being immediately terminated as a probationary employee.\u201d (/d. \u00a7 18.)\n\nDeclarations filed by the Government only bolster the Court\u2019s prior conclusion that the\nterminations were not based upon any individualized review, as the declarations essentially state\nas much. A declaration filed by the Chief Human Capital Officer of the Department of Homeland\nSecurity explains that \u201cDHS terminated approximately 313 probationary employees between\nJanuary 20, 2025 and March 14, 2025. This number excludes probationary employees who were\nterminated in individualized actions based on their performance or conduct, and therefore\nexcludes individuals who do not meet the definition of \u2018Affected Probationary Employees\u2019 in\nparagraph 10(c) of the [TRO] entered in this case on March 13, 2025.\u201d (ECF No. 52-1 at 14\n(emphasis added).) A declaration filed by the Assistant Secretary for Administration for the\nDepartment of Transportation explains that it terminated 788 probationary employees; that, of\nthose, \u201c775 are Affected Probationary Employees\u201d as defined in the Court\u2019s TRO; and that, \u201c[o]f\nthe remaining 13 terminated employees, two were terminated based on_ individualized\nperformance-based determinations, eight had their terminations rescinded before issuance of the\nTRO, two resigned, and one accepted the Deferred Resignation Program.\u201d (/d. at 18 & n.1.) And\na declaration filed by the Deputy to the Acting Chairman and Chief Operating Officer of the FDIC\nexplains that \u201c[t]he FDIC terminated approximately 156 probationary employees out of\napproximately 261 eligible probationary employees between February 18 and 19, 2025. There\nwere five probationary employees terminated as a part of the group that would have otherwise\nbeen terminated for individualized reasons based on performance/conduct.\u201d (/d. at 44.)\n\nFurther evidence supports the Court\u2019s prior conclusion that \u201c[t]he sheer number of\u201d\n\nterminated employees \u201cbelies any argument that these terminations were due to the employees\u2019\n\n44\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document125 Filed 04/01/25 Page 47 of 84\n\nindividual unsatisfactory performance or conduct,\u201d (TRO Mem. at 35), and that these instead were\nRIFs. In particular, the Court notes detail\u2014supplied by the Government\u2014tegarding the precise\nnumber of probationary employees fired from the Defendant Agencies. The record now reflects\nthat over 24,000 employees were terminated from the Defendant Agencies covered by the TRO.\n(See generally ECF Nos. 52-1, 52-2 (declarations by Defendant Agencies reflecting the number of\nemployees terminated at each agency); ECF No. 78-8 (chart provided by the States summarizing\nthe number of employees fired by each).) This number does not include the employees terminated\nat three agencies\u2014Department of Defense (\u201cDefense\u201d), the National Archives and Records\nAdministration (\u201cArchives\u201d), and OPM\u2014making the actual number of terminated probationary\nemployees even higher. On that score, a declaration from a former Director of OPM provides that,\n\n[iJn my experience, and under the laws and regulations that apply to federal\n\nemployment with which I am familiar, any agency that wished to release an\n\nindividual, including a probationary individual from employment, would conduct\n\nan individualized assessment of performance. If the news reports are correct about\n\nthe volume of the terminations, it is not possible for these agencies to have done\n\nproper assessments of all of these employees. Nor is it plausible that all these\n\nemployees have performance issues.\n(ECF No. 78-9 \u00a2 13.)\n\nThe record reflects that the terminations were effected by means of form letters terminating\nemployees en masse, despite good performance by those employees. (See, e.g., ECF Nos. 33-1 to\n33-19; ECF Nos. 79-13 to -15 (termination letters and accompanying declarations); see also ECF\nNo. 78-5 4 9 (declaration of the president of American Federation of State, County and Municipal\nEmployees Local 3976 stating that they had \u201cseen several [USDA] employees\u2019 termination notices\nfrom our bargaining unit, and they were all identical\u201d); ECF No. 78-10 4 14 (declaration of an\n\nemployee of the American Federation of Government Employees explaining that, \u201c[i]n forty-three\n\ninstances, employees sent us copies of their performance evaluations with their termination\n\n45\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document125 Filed 04/01/25 Page 48 of 84\n\nletters,\u201d that \u201cthe evaluations indicated satisfactory or above-average performance,\u201d and that \u201cmost\nof the evaluations indicated performance at the highest level possible\u201d); ECF No. 33-2 at 3\n(declaration of terminated HHS probationary employee explaining that \u201cI know of many other\nprobationary employees at HHS that received th[{e] same termination letter\u201d); ECF No. 33-4 at 3\n(similar for employee of the Department of Housing and Urban Development); ECF No. 33-6 at 3\n(similar for employee of the Department of Labor); ECF No. 33-7 at 3 (similar for employee of\nGSA); ECF No. 33-8 at 3 (similar for employee of the Department of Education); ECF No. 33-9\nat 3 (similar for employee of the Department of the Treasury); ECF No. 33-11 at 3 (similar for\nemployee of FEMA); ECF No. 33-12 at 3 (similar for employee of the Department of Energy);\nECF No. 33-17 at 4 (similar for employee of EPA).)\n\nIn addition, OPM issued guidance on January 20, 2025, providing that agency heads should\n\u201cidentify all employees on probationary periods... and... send a report to OPM listing all such\nemployees\u201d as well as \u201cpromptly determine whether those employees should be retained by the\nagency.\u201d (See ECF No. 78-1 at 5 (quoting Memo from Charles Ezell, Acting Director of OPM, re\nGuidance on Probationary Periods, Administrative Leave and Details, at 1 (Jan. 20, 2025)).) On\nFebruary 14, 2025, OPM issued a memorandum indicating that it had \u201casked that [agencies]\nseparate probationary employees that [they] ha[d] not identified as mission-critical no later than\nend of the day Monday, 2/17,\u201d and that it had \u201cattached a template letter.\u201d (ECF No. 78-4 at 2.)\nThe memorandum goes on to state that \u201cOPM believes \u2018qualifications for continued employment\u2019\nin the current context means that only the highest-performing probationers in mission-critical areas\nshould be retained.\u201d (/d. at 3.)\n\nThat reference to retaining probationers only in mission-critical areas suggests that this was\n\naimed at a reduction in probationers across the board. And the Defendant Agencies listened.\n\n46\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document125 Filed 04/01/25 Page 49 of 84\n\nNearly every declaration filed by the Defendant Agencies states that each relevant agency received\nthe OPM guidance memorandum of January 20, 2025\u2014which, again, stated that \u201c\u2018agencies should\nidentify all employees on probationary periods\u2019 and \u2018should promptly determine whether those\nemployees should be retained at the agency,\u2019\u201d (see, e.g., ECF No. 52-1 at 6)\u2014and then swiftly\nterminated large numbers of probationary employees (in most cases, hundreds or even thousands).\n(See generally id. (declarations from EPA, Department of Energy, Department of Commerce,\nDepartment of Homeland Security, Department of Transportation, Department of Education,\nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development, Department of the Interior, Department of Labor,\nCFPB, Small Business Administration, FDIC, USAID, GSA, Department of the Treasury,\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs, and HHS).) The only declaration that does not explicitly\nreference the OPM guidance memorandum is one from USDA, which states only that\n\u201capproximately 5,714 probationary employees were terminated from USDA beginning February\n13, 2025, and concluding on or around February 17, 2025.\u201d (See id. at 56.)\n\nThe Government\u2019s own briefing also indicates that these terminations were RIFs. As noted\nabove, an agency is directed to use the RIF procedures when terminating an employee for purposes\nof, among other things, a reorganization. See 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.201(a)(2); Workforce Reshaping\nOperations Handbook, supra, at 25-26. And, as noted above, a reorganization in the context of a\nRIF \u201cmeans the planned elimination, addition, or redistribution of functions or duties in an\norganization.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.203. The Government states in its briefing that the terminations\nwere conducted due to a lack of work and/or funds, and that the agencies have been reorganizing\ntheir workforces. (See ECF No. 101 at 20-21 (arguing that \u201c[nJothing in the OPM regulations\nsays that agencies cannot conduct assessments of an employee\u2019s utility to the agency in light of\n\nresource constraints and agency priorities\u201d and that assessing an employee\u2019s \u201cfitness\u201d or\n\n47\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document125 Filed 04/01/25 Page 50 of 84\n\n99 66\n\n\u201cqualifications\u201d \u201cencompass[es] an analysis of whether the individual\u2019s abilities warrant continued\nemployment in light of current agency priorities\u201d (emphasis added)).) The Court agrees with the\nGovernment, to a point. Of course agencies may assess employees\u2019 utility in light of agency\npriorities and resource constraints. But, when they eliminate positions due to lack of work,\nfunding, or a reorganization, as was the case here, they must use the RIF procedures. '*\n\nThe Government seems to argue that, because it did not comply with the RIF requirements\nin terminating large numbers of probationary employees, the terminations were not RIFs at all.\n(See, e.g., ECF No. 101 at 18-19 (\u201cPlaintiffs have not shown that Defendants made the findings\nrequired for the RIF statute to apply. Defendants thus had no compliance obligations under the\nRIF statute.\u201d).) And it argues that \u201c[e]ven if... defendants had terminated certain probationary\nemployees without sufficient cause, that does not make the termination a RIF subject to notice\nrequirements.\u201d (/d. at 23.) These arguments are in the same unconvincing vein\u2014that because the\nGovernment did not call the terminations RIFs, and because it did not take even the most\npreliminary steps toward complying with the RIF requirements, the terminations were not RIFs.\nThis has it backwards. The existence of a RIF turns not on whether the Government followed all\nthe requisite procedures, but rather on whether the Government in fact terminated employees as\n\npart of a reorganization\u2014tregardless of what label the Government attaches to the actions. To\n\nreach the opposite conclusion\u2014to say that the Government can choose to conduct RIFs without\n\n'\u2019 The Government also argues that agencies can terminate a probationary employee \u201cif the agency decides\nthat paying their salary is unwarranted given the agency\u2019s current priorities.\u201d (ECF No. 101 at 21.) In\nsupport of this proposition, the Government cites only to the dictionary definitions of \u201cqualification\u201d and\n\u201cfitness,\u201d neither of which support its lone assertion that these terms, as used in the relevant regulations, do\nnot involve an individualized assessment of the employee\u2019s individual fit for the job. (See id. at 21-22.)\n\nFurther, even assuming that the Government is correct that an agency can terminate an employee\nbased on \u201cfitness\u201d or \u201cqualifications\u201d upon an assessment that it does not find it warranted to pay the\nemployee their salary, where multiple agencies determine that hundreds or thousands of employees should\nno longer be paid their salaries, that is a RIF, pure and simple.\n\n48\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document125 Filed 04/01/25 Page 51 of 84\n\nfollowing RIF procedures so long as it does not call its actions RIFs\u2014would be to utterly frustrate\nthe manifest intent of Congress that the Government conduct mass layoffs in a planned and rational\nmanner, including (as relevant here) by providing advance notice to the affected states.'\u00b0 The\nCourt does not find the relevant statutory text ambiguous, and even if it did, the Court would not\nadopt a construction that would have the effect of vitiating the statute altogether when, as here, the\ntext does not compel such a result. See Antonin Scalia & Brian A. Garner, Reading Law: The\nInterpretation of Legal Texts 63 (2012) (\u201cThe presumption against ineffectiveness ensures that a\ntext\u2019s manifest purpose is furthered, not hindered.\u201d); cf, King v. Burwell, 576 U.S. 473, 498 (2015)\n(\u201cCongress passed the Affordable Care Act to improve health insurance markets, not to destroy\nthem. If at all possible, we must interpret the Act in a way that is consistent with the former, and\navoids the latter.\u201d).\n\nThe Government has not cited authority for the proposition that, because it did not call\nthese terminations RIFs, they were not RIFs. But as the foregoing and the Court\u2019s prior TRO\nanalysis make clear, these were indeed RIFs\u2014even if the Government does not refer to them as\nsuch, and even if the Government did not carry them out properly. If it walks like a duck, swims\nlike a duck, and quacks like a duck, the Government cannot instead make it a rooster by sheer ipse\ndixit.\n\ni. Defense, Archives, and OPM Conducted RIFs\nThe Court previously found that the States had not carried their burden of showing a\n\nlikelihood of success on the merits with respect to three Defendant Agencies\u2014Defense, Archives,\n\n'S Similarly meritless is the Government\u2019s suggestion that Congress, in enacting 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502, meant\nmerely to provide \u201ca reduction in force process that agencies can pick up off the rack and follow if they\nwant to go in that direction for executing a reduction in force.\u201d (ECF No. 119 at 34:13-34:15.) But\nCongress is not in the habit of writing \u201coff the rack\u201d suggestions that parties can choose to follow \u201cif they\nwant to go in that direction.\u201d Congress, of course, writes Jaws that bind both the people and their\ngovernment.\n\n49\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document125 Filed 04/01/25 Page 52 of 84\n\nand OPM. As the Court then explained, \u201c[w]ith respect to these three named agencies only, the\nStates have not provided any affidavits from, for example, former employees attesting to their\nterminations, or to the presence of widespread terminations of probationary employees.\u201d (TRO\nMem. at 41 (citation omitted).) That conclusion was without prejudice to the States\u2019 presentation\nof additional evidence with respect to these agencies. (/d.)\n\nThe Court now finds that the States have carried their burden of showing RIFs occurred at\nthose agencies.'\u00b0 The States have provided declarations from terminated employees from each of\nthese agencies, similar to those provided for other Defendant Agencies previously, along with\nadditional information that bolsters the States\u2019 contention.\n\nAn OPM probationary employee explains that they were terminated on February 13, 2025,\ndespite past positive job performance. (ECF No. 78-13 at 3-4.) That employee had received a\nperformance review less than one week prior, on February 7, 2025, stating that they were\n\u201cperforming at or above the Fully Successful level . . . (and had performed at or above Fully\nSuccessful for their entire time as an employee of OPM).\u201d (Jd. at 4, 6.) The employee further\nexplains that their \u201csupervisor and leadership . . . were never informed that we were being\nterminated; our supervisors only found out from me and my fellow terminated colleagues directly.\u201d\n(/d. at 3.) The termination letter contains boilerplate language similar to other termination letters\nin the record. (See id. at 6-7 (explaining that, \u201cbased on your performance . . . you have not\ndemonstrated that your further employment . . . would be in the public interest\u2019\u2019).)\n\nAn Archives probationary employee provides a declaration that explains that they received\n\na call from their supervisor and a union representative to relay that, \u201can hour prior, they had\n\n'\u00a9 However, as discussed later in this Memorandum, although the Court concludes that it is likely that\nArchives conducted a RIF, the Court lacks adequate basis in the record to conclude that the Plaintiff States\nwere entitled to notice of RIFs at Archives.\n\n50\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document125 Filed 04/01/25 Page 53 of 84\n\nreceived a call instructing them to terminate all probationary employees at [the Office of the\nFederal Register].\u201d (ECF No. 78-14 at 2.) The employee explains that they were told that their\n\u201cjob performance was excellent and that [Archives] was not terminating me based on my job\nperformance.\u201d (/d. at 3-4.) The employee also explains that they received a notice of termination,\nwhich provided that the employee was terminated because, \u201c[i]n accordance with the direction to\nagencies to reduce budgets, implement a hiring freeze, reorganize and reprioritize our work and\nprepare for a reduction in force, we have come to the conclusion that we cannot continue with the\ncurrent staffing levels.\u201d (/d. at 3.)\n\nA Defense probationary employee provides an affidavit in which they aver that they\nreceived a termination letter stating that \u201cbased on your performance . . . you have not\ndemonstrated that your further employment . . . would be in the public interest.\u201d (ECF No. 78-15\nat 7-8.) However, that employee\u2019s supervisor later wrote a letter of recommendation explaining\nthat she offered her strongest recommendation of the employee, who was \u201conly permitted to\nwork . . . for a few weeks before the Defense Health Agency decided to dismiss her from Federal\nservice citing her status as a probationary employee.\u201d (/d. at 10.) The recommendation letter also\nexplains that, although the termination letter stated that the employee\u2019s employment would not be\nin the public interest, the supervisor\u2019s experience \u201cwas precisely counter to [those] findings.\u201d (/d.)\nAnother recommendation letter provides that the employee\u2019s termination was not based on her\nsupervisors\u2019 individualized assessment, which was positive. (See id. at 13.)\n\nThe record includes a document from the Defense Civilian Personnel Advisory Service\ninstructing that, \u201c[u]sing the attached Notification of Termination During Probationary Period\ntemplate, all [Defense] Components must terminate the employment of all individuals who are\n\ncurrently serving a probationary or trial period in [that department], subject to the exceptions listed\n\n51\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document125 Filed 04/01/25 Page 54 of 84\n\nbelow, beginning February 28, 2025.\u201d (ECF No. 78-10 at 12.) It goes on to state that, \u201c[flollowing\ndirection from OPM . . . federal agencies have been thoroughly reviewing their rosters to identify\nindividuals serving a probationary or trial period in mission-critical positions essential for\nexecuting agency functions and fulfilling national priorities. This review aligns with the\nAdministration\u2019s directive to streamline the federal workforce and ensure effective resource\nallocation.\u201d (/d.)\n\nA third document from Defense reflects that the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense\nissued a memorandum providing that,\n\n[cJonsistent with Executive Order 13217, \u201cCommencing the Reduction of the\n\nFederal Bureaucracy,\u201d February 19, 2025; Executive Order 14210, \u201cImplementing\n\nthe President\u2019s \u2018Department of Government Efficiency\u2019 Workforce Optimization\n\nInitiative,\u201d February 11, 2025; and the Secretary of Defense\u2019s clear direction to\n\nstreamline operations and prioritize critical missions in order to re-direct scarce and\n\nlimited resources towards enhancing the lethality and war fighting capacity of the\n\nDepartment of Defense, the Department is taking independent steps to reduce the\n\nsize of the civilian workforce . .. . The first step in doing this will be terminating\n\nthose probationary employees whose continued employment at the Department\n\nwould not be in the public interest. These terminations will commence on Monday,\n\nMarch 3, 2025.\n\n(ECF No. 78-16 at 2.)\n\nBased on the foregoing, the Court concludes that it is likely that OPM, Archives, and\nDefense'\u2019\u2014in addition to the Defendant Agencies discussed in the TRO Memorandum\u2014each\nconducted RIFs.\n\n4, The States Were Not Provided Requisite Notice\nIf employees are terminated as part of a RIF, there are legal requirements the agencies must\n\nfollow. See generally 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502; 5 C.F.R. Part 351. One such requirement is that, whenever\n\na RIF involves at least fifty employees within a competitive area, the agency must provide notice\n\n'7 As the accompanying Order makes clear, the Court\u2019s ruling applies to civilian Defense employees.\n\n52\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document125 Filed 04/01/25 Page 55 of 84\n\nto \u201c[t]he State or the entity designated by the State to carry out rapid response activities under [the\nWIOA].\u201d See 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.803(b)(1). The Court concludes that the States were due notice from\nnearly every Defendant Agency, but that those agencies failed to provide it.\ni. Notice Requirements\n\n5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d)(1)(B) provides, inter alia, that \u201can employee may not be released, due\nto a reduction in force, unless[,] . . . [in the event] the reduction in force would involve the\nseparation of a significant number of employees, the requirements of paragraph (3) are met at least\n60 days before any employee is so released.\u201d Paragraph (3) provides as follows:\n\nNotice under paragraph (1)(B)\u2014\n\n(A) shall be given to\u2014\n(i) the State or entity designated by the State to carry out rapid\nresponse activities under section 134(a)(2)(A) of the [WIOA]; and\n(ii) the chief elected official of such unit or each of such units of\nlocal government as may be appropriate; and\n\n(B) shall consist of written notification as to\u2014\n(i) the number of employees to be separated from service due to the\nreduction in force (broken down by geographic area or on such other\nbasis as may be required under paragraph (4));\n(ii) when those separations will occur; and\n(iii) any other matter which might facilitate the delivery of rapid\nresponse assistance or other services under [the WIOA].\n\n5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d)(3). The relevant implementing regulations provide that:\n\n(b) When 50 or more employees in a competitive area receive separation notices\nunder this part, the agency must provide written notification of the action, at the\nsame time it issues specific notices of separation to employees, to:\n(1) The State or the entity designated by the State to carry out rapid response\nactivities under title I of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998;\n(2) The chief elected official of local government(s) within which these\nseparations will occur; and\n(3) OPM.\n(c) The notice required by paragraph (b) of this section must include:\n(1) The number of employees to be separated from the agency by reduction\nin force (broken down by geographic area or other basis specified by OPM);\n(2) The effective date of the separations; and\n\n53\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document125 Filed 04/01/25 Page 56 of 84\n\n(3) Any other information specified by OPM, including information needs\nidentified from consultation between OPM and the Department of Labor to\nfacilitate delivery of placement and related services.\n\n5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.803(b)-(c).\nil. The Competitive Area Threshold Is Met\n\nWith respect to the term \u201ccompetitive area,\u201d the relevant regulation provides that\n\n[a] competitive area must be defined solely in terms of the agency\u2019s organizational\n\nunit(s) and geographical location and, except as provided in paragraph (e) of this\n\nsection, it must include all employees within the competitive area so defined. A\n\ncompetitive area may consist of all or part of an agency. The minimum competitive\n\narea is a subdivision of the agency under separate administration within the local\n\ncommuting area.\n5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.402(b).\n\nThis language is not a model of clarity. However, it makes clear that a \u201ccompetitive area\u201d\ncan be drawn as large as \u201call... of an agency\u201d or that it can be drawn more narrowly. See 5 C.F.R.\n\u00a7 351.402(b). And, as the text reveals, there is a lack of congruence between the geographical\nboundaries of states and the contours of the competitive areas that must be defined prior to any\nRIF. It is virtually inevitable, moreover, that even when a competitive area is drawn with the\nnarrowest permissible geographic scope\u2014i.e., as \u201ca subdivision of the agency under separate\nadministration within the local commuting area,\u201d id. \u2014it will still necessarily cross state lines in\ncertain instances.\n\nThe term \u201clocal commuting area\u201d is not defined for the purposes of this provision, but the\nterm is used and defined elsewhere in the Code of Federal Regulations. In one instance, the term\nis defined as \u201cthe geographic area that usually constitutes one area for employment purposes[,|\ninclud[ing] any population center (or two or more neighboring ones) and the surrounding localities\n\nin which people live and can reasonably be expected to travel back and forth daily to their usual\n\nemployment.\u201d 10 C.F.R. \u00a7 709.2. Another provision defines the term as a \u201cpopulation center (or\n\n54\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document125 Filed 04/01/25 Page 57 of 84\n\ntwo or more neighboring ones)\u201d along with the \u201csurrounding areas that can reasonably be\nconsidered part of this single area for transportation purposes,\u201d and, in certain cases, as\nhomologous with defined metropolitan areas. 15 C.F.R. \u00a7 946.2.\n\nWithout determining precisely what the meaning of \u201clocal commuting area\u201d is in the\ncontext of 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.402, it is almost certain that, for example, the District of Columbia and\nportions of Maryland and Virginia would constitute one such area. Or, to take another example,\nthe Chicago local commuting area would likely include parts of Illinois as well as parts of\nWisconsin and Indiana. But both of these examples raise a complication\u2014the District of Columbia\nand Maryland, as well as Illinois and Wisconsin, are parties to this suit, but Virginia and Indiana\nare not.\n\nBeyond the issue of \u201clocal commuting areas,\u201d the \u201ccompetitive area\u201d can be much larger.\nIndeed, OPM guidance suggests that \u201c[o]rganization could be defined agency-wide; geographical\nlocation could be defined as nationwide.\u201d U.S. Off. of Pers. Mgmt., Competitive Areas in\nReduction in Force (RIF) \\ (Mar. 2025), https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/work force-\nrestructuring/reductions-in-force-rif/rif-competitive-areas.pdf [https://perma.cc/5GLN-L3 Y4].\n\nGiven the sheer number of terminated employees, it is implausible that fewer than fifty\npeople were terminated through a RIF at each of the Defendant Agencies, save Archives (which\nthe Court addresses in more detail below). Most Defendant Agencies terminated hundreds or\nthousands of employees. (See generally ECF Nos. 52-1, 52-2, 78-8 (declarations from Defendant\nAgencies other than OPM, Defense, and Archives); ECF No. 78-13 at 3 (declaration from OPM\nprobationary employee explaining that \u201cI was terminated along with eight other probation[y]\ncolleagues... and nearly 100 employees across OPM\u201d); ECF No. 78-15 (declaration from Defense\n\nemployee explaining that they believe, \u201cbased on news reports and conversations with former\n\na3\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document125 Filed 04/01/25 Page 58 of 84\n\ncolleagues, that Defense has terminated dozens of probationary employees since March 3, 2025\u201d);\nAm. Fed\u2019n of Gov't Emps., Civ. No. WHA-25-1780, ECF No. 141-1 (\u201cDepartment [of Defense]\nrecords indicate that since February 13, 2025, the Department separated, or notified of termination,\n364 probationary employees in light of recent OPM guidance.\u201d)'\u00ae.)\n\nHowever, the States have not pointed to any evidence in the record\u2014and the Court has\nfound none\u2014that this threshold was met at Archives. Thus, although the Court concludes that\nArchives likely conducted RIFs, the Court cannot conclude at this time that the States were entitled\nto notice with respect to Archives employees.\n\nAlthough the Government seems to argue to the contrary, the Government cannot be\npermitted to skirt RIF notice requirements by simply not defining the competitive area as required\nand then claiming the preconditions for RIF notice have not been met. In any event, without the\nGovernment having defined the competitive areas more narrowly, the Government will not be\nheard to complain about the Court\u2019s default assumption that those areas are agency-wide.\n\niii. The States Were Entitled to Notice\n\nThe Court next turns to when a state is due notice. The Court concludes that a state\u2019s\nentitlement to notice turns on whether fifty or more employees in a competitive area are terminated,\nand whether any one employee either lives or works in that state. This conclusion encompasses\ntwo, interrelated, subsidiary determinations: first, that the notice threshold is met when fifty or\nmore workers in a competitive area (not a state) are terminated; and second, that the \u201cState\u201d entitled\nto notice when this threshold has been met, see 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d), covers both (1) the state in\n\nwhich an affected worker lives and (2) the state in which an affected worker resides, to the extent\n\n'8 The Court may take judicial notice of this document, which was filed in another federal case. See, e.g.,\nColonial Penn Ins. Co. v. Coil, 887 F.2d 1236, 1239 (4th Cir. 1989) (\u201cWe note that the most frequent use\nof judicial notice of ascertainable facts is in noticing the content of court records.\u201d (cleaned up)).\n\n56\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document125 Filed 04/01/25 Page 59 of 84\n\nthat the states are not the same. To reach these conclusions, some work is required, as neither the\nstatute nor the regulations are models of legislative draftsmanship.\na. When Is the Threshold for Notice Met?\n\nThe statutory and regulatory framework establishes that the Government\u2019s obligation to\nprovide notice turns not on whether fifty or more employees in any state are to be terminated, but\nrather whether there are fifty or more such employees in a competitive area. The statute simply\nsays that when a RIF involves \u201cthe separation of a significant number of employees,\u201d notice must\nbe given to \u201cthe State\u201d or state agency designated to carry out rapid-response activities under the\nWIOA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 3174. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d)(1)(B), (3)(A)(1). The implementing regulations do\nnot define \u201csignificant number,\u201d in so many words, but they do provide that the notice threshold\nis met \u201c[w]hen 50 or more employees in a competitive area receive separation notices\u201d pursuant\ntoa RIF. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.803(b).\n\nWith respect to the \u201crapid response activities\u201d referenced in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d), separate\nregulations provide that a state must deliver rapid-response services whenever there is a \u201cmass\nlayoff\u201d in that state, where \u201cmass layoff\u201d is defined as the lesser of either (1) the state\u2019s definition\nof the term or (2) fifty people. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 682.302, .305. But the regulations are not clear as to\nwhether a \u201cmass layoff,\u201d for WIOA purposes, refers to the loss of fifty or more jobs of state\nresidents (even if the residents work in another state) or fifty or more jobs located in the state (even\nif the workers reside in another state).\n\nNotwithstanding the reference in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d) to the WIOA, which relates to states\u2019\nrapid-response obligations, the Court concludes that states are due notice regardless of whether\nthere would be enough layoffs in the state to qualify as a \u201cmass layoff\u2019 event. The statute requires\n\nthere to be \u201ca significant number of employees\u201d separated overall as part of the RIF, but it does\n\n57\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document125 Filed 04/01/25 Page 60 of 84\n\nnot require that there also be a \u201csignificant number of employees\u201d separated in each state entitled\nto notice. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d). Similarly, the regulations provide that \u201c[w]hen 50 or more\nemployees in a competitive area receive separation notices ... the agency must provide written\nnotification of the action... to... [t]he State or the entity designated by the State to carry out\nrapid response activities under [the WIOA].\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.803(a). Thus, as long as fifty or more\npeople in a competitive area (as opposed to any given state) are terminated, notice must be\nprovided. There is no requirement, in either the statute or the regulations, that notice be given only\nto a particular state if the layoffs qualify as a \u201cmass layoff\u201d in that state for purposes of the WIOA.\nAnd the Court will not read in an extra requirement that is absent from the statutory text. See 62\nCases, More or Less, Each Containing Six Jars of Jam v. United States, 340 U.S. 593, 596 (1951)\n(\u201c[O]ur problem is to construe what Congress has written. After all, Congress expresses its\npurpose by words. It is for us to ascertain\u2014neither to add nor to subtract, neither to delete nor to\ndistort.\u201d\u2019).\nb. Which States Are Entitled to Notice?\n\nNeither the RIF statute nor the accompanying regulations expressly say which states are\ndue notice when fifty or more people in a competitive area are terminated. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d);\n5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.803. However, the Court concludes that the best reading is that any state in which\nan employee in the competitive area lives or works should be given notice. This is so because,\nunder the WIOA, a state\u2019s rapid-response activities are tied (as relevant here) to the presence of a\n\u201cmass layoff... or other disaster, that results in mass job dislocation.\u201d 29 U.S.C \u00a7 3102(51). The\nWIOA and its implementing regulations do not appear to draw a distinction between a state whose\nworkers suffer a mass layoff and one whose residents suffer a mass layoff. Some required rapid-\n\nresponse activities appear to fall more appropriately on the state in which the worker works, see\n\n58\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document125 Filed 04/01/25 Page 61 of 84\n\n20 C.F.R. \u00a7 682.300(b)(1) (requiring a state to provide workers with information on how to file\nfor unemployment), whereas others more naturally apply to the state where the worker lives, see\nid. \u00a7 682.300(b)(3) (requiring states to, inter alia, facilitate assistance with home heating). Thus,\nthe WIOA appears to contemplate that both the state in which an employee lives and the state in\nwhich an employee works\u2014to the extent they are not one and the same\u2014would be responsible for\nproviding certain rapid-response activities in the event of a mass layoff.\n\nThere is therefore no principled basis for the Court to prefer a reading of \u201cthe State\u201d in 5\nU.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d) that is limited to the state of an employee\u2019s duty station, as opposed to the state\nof the employee\u2019s residence. Nor, for that matter, is there any principled reason for the Court to\nprefer the opposite reading. Thus, given that the self-evident purpose of the RIF statute\u2019s notice-\nto-state provision is to assist states in complying with their WIOA obligations, it makes sense to\nunderstand the reference to \u201cthe State\u201d in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d) as referring both to the state in which\nan employee\u2019s duty station is located and to the employee\u2019s state of residence.\n\nWhat is the upshot of all this? The Court concludes that a state is entitled to notice of a\nRIF if fifty or more people in a competitive area are terminated and any employee within that\ncompetitive area resides or works in the state. To take an example, suppose an agency\nheadquartered in Northern Virginia was planning to undertake a RIF, and it identified a\ncompetitive area comprising a total of fifty employees, with forty-eight residing in Virginia and\none each residing in the District of Columbia and Maryland. Even though only one employee in\neach of the District of Columbia and Maryland would be affected, all three jurisdictions would be\nentitled to notice pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d) and 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.803(b). To take another\nexample, if an agency followed OPM\u2019s invitation to define a \u201cnationwide\u201d competitive area, then\n\nso long as fifty people in that competitive area throughout the country received termination notices,\n\n59\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document125 Filed 04/01/25 Page 62 of 84\n\nby the terms of the statute, every state with at least one employee in that competitive area would\nbe entitled to notice. In short, when an agency separates fifty or more employees in a \u201ccompetitive\narea\u201d\u2014a term which can comprise multiple states, an entire agency, and, perhaps, the entire\ncountry\u2014the agency must provide notice to any state in which any number of those employees\nworks or lives.\n\nC. How Do the Notice Requirements Apply to This Case?\n\nWith that in mind, the Court concludes that the Plaintiff States were due notice. As the\nCourt explained above, the Defendant Agencies conducted RIFs, and they involved at least fifty\npeople in a competitive area. Thus, any States in which those employees lived or worked were\ndue notice, which it is undisputed that no Plaintiff State received.\n\nThere is evidence in the record with respect to nearly every Plaintiff State that suggests\nthat terminated probationary employees lived or worked in those States. (See generally ECF Nos.\n4-5, 4-38 (declarations from the Maryland Department of Labor and Comptroller discussing\nterminated probationary employees in the state); ECF Nos. 33-1, 33-2, 33-6, 33-8, 33-15, 78-14,\n78-15, 78-20 (declarations from terminated probationary employees residing and/or working in\nMaryland); ECF Nos. 33-18, 33-19, 78-13 (declarations from terminated probationary employees\nliving and working in Minnesota); ECF Nos. 33-1, 33-3, 33-4, 33-5, 33-6, 33-7, 33-8, 33-9, 33-10,\n33-11, 33-12, 78-14, 78-19 (declarations from terminated probationary employees residing and/or\nworking in Washington, D.C.); ECF No. 4-6 (declaration from the Arizona Department of\nEconomic Security discussing terminated probationary employees in the state); ECF No. 4-7\n(declaration from the California Employment Development Department discussing terminated\nprobationary employees in the state); ECF Nos. 33-13, 33-14 (declarations from terminated\n\nprobationary employees residing and/or working in California); ECF No. 4-39 (declaration from\n\n60\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document125 Filed 04/01/25 Page 63 of 84\n\nthe Colorado Division of Unemployment Insurance discussing terminated probationary employees\nin the state); ECF Nos. 33-15, 33-16 (declaration from terminated probationary employees residing\nand/or working in Delaware); ECF No. 4-8 (declaration from the Illinois Department of\nEmployment Security discussing terminated probationary employees in the state); ECF No. 4-9\n(declaration from the Massachusetts Executive Office of Labor and Workforce Development\ndiscussing terminated probationary employees in the state); ECF No. 33-17 (declaration from\nterminated probationary employee with a Massachusetts duty station but living in Rhode Island);\nECF No. 78-17 (declaration from the Michigan Unemployment Insurance Agency discussing\nterminated probationary employees in the state); ECF No. 4-11 (declaration from the New Jersey\nDepartment of Labor and Workforce Development discussing terminated probationary employees\nin the state); ECF No. 78-18 (declaration from the New Mexico Department of Workforce\nSolutions discussing terminated probationary employees in the state); ECF No. 4-13 (declaration\nfrom the New York Department of Labor discussing terminated probationary employees in the\nstate); ECF No. 4-14 (declaration from Oregon\u2019s Higher Education Coordinating Commission\ndiscussing terminated probationary employees in the state).)\n\nThe Court extends this conclusion to those States that have not provided specific evidence\nthat they have a terminated employee working or living in the state: Connecticut, Hawai\u2019i, Nevada,\nVermont, and Wisconsin. For the purposes of a preliminary injunction, the Court finds it likely\nthat each Plaintiff State was entitled to notice. The Government has not defined any competitive\nareas, but given the number of workers fired, it is all but certain that a \u201csignificant number of\nemployees\u201d were terminated in what would have been properly defined competitive areas, and that\nthere was at least one employee in an area that would have constituted a competitive area in each\n\nPlaintiff State, thus triggering the notice requirement. Importantly, as explained above, the\n\n61\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document125 Filed 04/01/25 Page 64 of 84\n\nregulations do not require a finding that more than fifty people in a given state have been\nterminated; rather, there must merely be a showing that at least one employee in a given state is\npart of a competitive area in which fifty or more people were terminated.\n\nThe Court recognizes that the proof on this topic is not complete, and that reaching a final\ndetermination on the merits is complicated by the complete failure of the Government to define\nany competitive areas, which makes it difficult to determine exactly which States would have been\nowed notice if the RIFs had been conducted properly. However, the Court\u2019s findings at the\npreliminary injunction stage are properly based on \u201cprocedures that are less formal and evidence\nthat is less complete than in a trial on the merits.\u201d Lackey, 145 S. Ct. at 667 (quoting Camenisch,\n451 U.S. at 395); see also G.G., 822 F.3d at 725 (indicating that the Court may consider both\n\u201cwell-pleaded allegations of [a plaintiffs] complaint and uncontroverted affidavits filed in support\nof the motion for a preliminary injunction\u201d (quoting Elrod, 427 U.S. at 350 n.1)). The Court\u2019s\npreliminary findings of \u201clikelihood of success\u201d must not be equated with a final finding of actual\nsuccess on the merits. Lackey, 145 S. Ct. at 667.\n\nB. Irreparable Harm\n\nAs the Court previously concluded, the States likely have suffered and will imminently\nsuffer irreparable harm. (TRO Mem. 43-44.) The Court incorporates that analysis by reference.\n\nThe Government cites to Roe v. Department of Defense, 947 F.3d 207 (4th Cir. 2020) for\nthe proposition that \u201c[m]ere injuries, however insubstantial, in terms of money, time and energy\nnecessarily expended in the absence of [an injunction] are not enough.\u201d (ECF No. 101 at 24\n(second alteration in original).) The Government misquotes the case (\u201cinsubstantial\u201d instead of\n\u201csubstantial\u201d), and also leaves out important context. Roe quoted Di Biase v. SPX Corp., 872 F.3d\n\n224 (4th Cir. 2017), which reads:\n\n62\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document125 Filed 04/01/25 Page 65 of 84\n\n\u201cMere injuries, however substantial, in terms of money, time and energy\n\nnecessarily expended in the absence of a stay are not enough. The possibility that\n\nadequate compensatory or other corrective relief will be available at a later date . . .\n\nweighs heavily against a claim of irreparable harm.\u201d Sampson v. Murray, 415 U.S.\n\n61, 90 (1974). A plaintiff must overcome the presumption that a preliminary\n\ninjunction will not issue when the harm suffered can be remedied by money\n\ndamages at the time of judgment. Hughes Network Sys., Inc. v. InterDigital\n\nComme \u2018ns Corp., 17 F.3d 691, 693 (4th Cir. 1994).\n\n872 F.3d at 230.\n\nAs the Court previously explained, although the harms are largely economic in nature\u2014in\nthe sense that the harms involve substantial costs associated with the Government\u2019s lack of notice,\nsee supra Section II].A.1\u2014they are nevertheless irreparable. The States are unlikely to be able to\nrecover money damages at the time of judgment to remedy their harms. Money damages are likely\nunavailable. See City of New York v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Def., 913 F.3d 423, 430 (4th Cir. 2019) (\u201cThe\nAPA waives the federal government\u2019s sovereign immunity for a limited set of suits, brought by \u2018a\nperson suffering legal wrong because of agency action\u2019 to obtain relief \u2018other than money\ndamages.\u201d (emphasis added) (quoting 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702)); Chef Time 1520 LLC v. Small Bus.\nAdmin., 646 F. Supp. 3d 101, 115-16 (D.D.C. 2022) (explaining that the unavailability of money\ndamages for APA claims counsels in favor of a finding of irreparable harm).\n\nAnd even if damages were available, they would be incredibly difficult to ascertain given\nthe multifaceted and complex nature of the impacts of the Government\u2019s actions on the Plaintiff\nStates. See Multi-Channel TV Cable Co. v. Charlottesville Quality Cable Operating Co., 22 F.3d\n546, 551 (4th Cir. 1994) (\u201cGenerally, irreparable injury is suffered when monetary damages are\ndifficult to ascertain or are inadequate.\u201d (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)),\nabrogated in part on other grounds, Winter, 555 U.S. 7. These impacts include, among other\n\nthings, the consequences of having to divert resources and personnel to accommodate the shifting\n\nunemployment-response landscape. (See, e.g., ECF No. 4-5 \u00a7 27 (declaration from the Maryland\n\n63\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document125 Filed 04/01/25 Page 66 of 84\n\nSecretary of Labor that Maryland Department of Labor personnel \u201chave been diverted from state-\nfunded workforce development projects, including the Employment Advancement Right Now\n(\u2018EARN\u2019) program, which is a. . . workforce development grant initiative serving over 5,000\nconstituents annually\u201d); id. | 26 (explaining that state matters that have been affected by the\ndiversion of resources include \u201coccupational and professional licensing oversight, financial\nregulation, [and] state workforce development programs,\u201d among others); id. \u00a7 58 (explaining that\ndiversions will also \u201cimpede the timely processing of regular [unemployment claims], creating\nsignificant backlogs and delays\u201d); ECF No. 4-8 \u00a7 24 (declaration from the Deputy Director,\nService Delivery of the Illinois Department of Employment Security explaining that \u201cthe diversion\nof personnel to handle [federal employees\u2019 unemployment-compensation] claims will impede the\ntimely processing of regular unemployment insurance claims, creating backlogs and delays\u201d).)\nFurther, as the Court explained above, the harm is also irreparable because the information\nto be provided by the Defendant Agencies is time sensitive and the harm itself is temporal and\nimmediate. Here, the Government argues that the harm is not irreparable because the harms the\nStates are suffering are not \u201cfairly traceable\u201d to the informational injury alleged. (ECF No. 101 at\n24.) The Government also argues that the harms suffered by the States are \u201cperipheral\u201d and\n\u201cincidental\u201d to any informational injury. (/d.) Not so. This is simply a rehashing of the\nGovernment\u2019s argument that the States lack standing. As discussed above with respect to the\nStates\u2019 standing to bring their claims, the harms suffered by the States are directly traceable to the\nGovernment\u2019s failure to provide notice. See supra Section III.A.2. The relevant statutes and\nregulations impose upon the States rapid-response responsibilities, which the RIF notice provision\n\nexplicitly reference. The regulatory and statutory scheme assumes that the Government will\n\n64\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document125 Filed 04/01/25 Page 67 of 84\n\nprovide the States with advance warning of layoffs so that the States can prepare in time. The\nStates\u2019 harms are hardly peripheral; indeed, they are the main problem Congress sought to avoid.\n\nC. Balance of the Equities & the Public Interest\n\nThe Court previously concluded that the balance of the equities and the public interest\nweighed in favor of injunctive relief. (TRO Mem. at 44-46.) It incorporates that analysis by\nreference here, and continues to so find.\n\nAs the Court previously explained, \u201cthe public undoubtedly has an interest in seeing its\ngovernmental institutions follow the law.\u201d Roe, 947 F.3d at 230-31 (internal quotation marks and\ncitation omitted). But the public interest goes beyond that. These unnoticed terminations have\nplaced a huge strain on the States and have disrupted State processes. See supra Section III.A.1.\nAlthough it has now abandoned this argument, at the TRO stage, the Government argued that the\nonly way the States could be made whole was by reinstatement. (See ECF No. 20 at 14 (\u201c[T]he\nStates\u2019 asserted injuries could only be conceivably redressed by [the employees\u2019] reinstatement.\u201d\n(emphasis omitted)); id. at 17 (\u201cTo prevent or stem the diversion of state assistance resources, the\nCourt again would have to order reinstatement of the removed probationers into their former\nagency jobs.\u201d).) The Court agreed then, and it agrees now.\n\nIn weighing the equities and assessing where the public interest lies, the Court must also\nconsider the harms imposed by any injunctive relief on the defendant, in the event the injunction\nis later determined to have been mistakenly granted. See Scotts Co. v. United Indus. Corp., 315\nF.3d 264, 283-84 (4th Cir. 2002). The Court recognizes the existence of weighty countervailing\ninterests on the Government\u2019s side of the ledger. There is of course a strong public interest in a\nvigorous and capable Executive Branch that can pursue its policy objectives, especially as those\n\nobjectives relate to Executive Branch employees. Given the \u201cwidest latitude in the dispatch of its\n\n65\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document125 Filed 04/01/25 Page 68 of 84\n\nown internal affairs\u201d that the Government has traditionally been accorded, Sampson, 415 U.S. at\n83 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted), the Court does not take lightly the prospect of\nordering relief in this space. But the public interest in the Executive Branch\u2019s ability to further its\npolicies does not extend so far as to permit the Government to flout statutes enacted by Congress\nand regulations duly promulgated pursuant to statutory authority. See League of Women Voters of\nU.S. v. Newby, 838 F.3d 1, 12 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (\u201c[T]here is a substantial public interest in having\ngovernmental agencies abide by the federal laws that govern their existence and operations.\u201d\n(citation and internal quotation marks omitted)). The Court also recognizes that the Government\nwill inevitably incur significant costs by retaining on its payroll, at least temporarily, employees\nthat it would have otherwise terminated. (See generally ECF Nos. 52-1, 52-2.) But, in the absence\nof injunctive relief, the Government\u2019s desired quick reduction in costs will inevitably correspond\nto a surge in costs borne by the Plaintiff States in responding to the unnoticed mass terminations.\n\nAfter weighing these considerations, the Court continues to find that the public interest and\nthe balance of equities favor immediate relief. If there were some narrower way to prevent the\nharm suffered by the States, the Court would take that path. But the Government cannot engage\nin far-reaching illegal activity and then complain that the remedy is too burdensome. A\npreliminary injunction is appropriate and, indeed, necessary.\nV. SCOPE OF RELIEF\n\nHaving determined that the States are entitled to a preliminary injunction, the Court turns\nto the appropriate scope of relief. As the Court previously observed, \u201c[t]his task \u2018is an exercise of\ndiscretion and judgment, often dependent as much on the equities of a given case as the substance\nof the legal issues it presents.\u201d\u201d (TRO Mem. at 49 (quoting Trump v. Int'l Refugee Assistance\n\nProject, 582 U.S. 571, 579 (2017).) Upon a review of the parties\u2019 briefs and the record, and after\n\n66\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document125 Filed 04/01/25 Page 69 of 84\n\ncareful consideration of the issues, the Court concludes that a \u00a7 705 stay and preliminary injunction\nthat is in some respects broader and in some narrower than the relief ordered at the TRO stage is\nwarranted. The preliminary injunction will be broader both temporally (in that it will extend\nindefinitely until final judgment unless otherwise ordered) and in the scope of agencies affected.\nAs the Court has explained, see supra Section IV.A.3.i, and unlike at the TRO stage, there is now\nrecord evidence showing that it is more likely than not that the Plaintiff States were entitled to\nnotice of RIFs occurring at Defense and OPM, although not at Archives. Accordingly, Defense\nand OPM will be added to the list of agencies enjoined.\n\nIn a crucial respect, however, the relief ordered today will be narrower in scope. At the\nTRO stage, the Court determined that nationwide relief was necessary to prevent irreparable harm\nand preserve the status quo until there was time for a full preliminary injunction hearing. (TRO\nMem. at 49-50.) With the benefit of more time to consider the issues, a more developed record,\nand additional ventilation of the salient issues by the parties, the Court concludes that narrower\nrelief is possible and appropriate in this case.\n\nA. Overview of Injunctive Relief\n\nIn APA cases, the Court\u2019s authority to order injunctive relief stems from two sources. One\nstems from the Court\u2019s equitable authority to grant preliminary injunctions. See Salazar v. Buono,\n559 U.S. 700, 714 (2010). The second is APA \u00a7 705, which permits courts to \u201cissue all necessary\nand appropriate process to postpone the effective date of an agency action or to preserve status or\nrights pending conclusion of the review proceedings.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 705. \u201cThe factors governing\nissuance of a preliminary injunction also govern issuance of a \u00a7 705 stay.\u201d (TRO Mem. at 51\n\n(quoting Casa de Md., Inc. v. Wolf, 486 F. Supp. 3d 928, 950 (D. Md. 2020).)\n\n67\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document125 Filed 04/01/25 Page 70 of 84\n\nAs the Court previously stated, \u201c[t]he purpose of a preliminary injunction is to preserve the\nstatus quo until there is a trial on the merits.\u201d (TRO Mem. at 47 (quoting Camenisch, 451 U.S. at\n395).) The Court also previously explained the nature of injunctive relief in APA cases and its\napplication to the facts of case in the TRO Memorandum. (/d. at 51\u201453.)!\u00b0 In short, and as more\nfully explained in the TRO Memorandum, \u201c[t]he ordinary remedy for unlawful agency actions is\nvacatur,\u201d and, \u201cjust as vacatur would likely be the appropriate remedy at the final judgment\nstage, ... the proper provisional remedy under Rule 65 and \u00a7 705 is a stay of the Government\u2019s\nefforts to terminate probationary employees en masse and without notice to the States.\u201d (/d. at 51\u2014\n52.) The Court determined that \u201c[o]nly an order staying the Government\u2019s likely unlawful RIF\nprocess can prevent the States from suffering irreparable injury in the form of the disruption and\ncosts imposed by the mass terminations.\u201d (/d. at 53.)\n\nB. Geographic Scope\n\nThe Court is aware of the heated debate surrounding nationwide (or \u201cuniversal\u201d)\ninjunctions in recent years. See generally District Court Reform: Nationwide Injunctions, 137\nHarv. L. Rev. 1701, 1703-15 (2024). As have others before it, the Court \u201cwades into this\ncontroversy reluctantly, and with caution.\u201d Alaska v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Educ., 739 F. Supp. 3d 873,\n897 n.11 (D. Kan. 2024). Nationwide injunctions have been characterized as \u201clegally and\nhistorically dubious,\u201d Trump v. Hawaii, 585 U.S. 667, 721 (2018) (Thomas, J., concurring), and\nas \u201cplainly inconsistent with . . . the proper scope of the federal courts\u2019 remedial power,\u201d CASA de\nMaryland, Inc. v. Trump, 971 F.3d 220, 257 (4th Cir. 2020), vacated for reh\u2019g en banc, 981 F.3d\n\n311 (4th Cir. 2020) (dismissed Mar. 11, 2021). It is contended that nationwide injunctions are\n\n'\u2019 The Court fully ratifies and incorporates its prior discussion about the distinction between prohibitory\nand mandatory injunctions and about the application of \u00a7 705 to the facts of this case. (TRO Mem. at 46\u2014\n48, 51-53.)\n\n68\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document125 Filed 04/01/25 Page 71 of 84\n\ninconsistent with the foundational principle that the courts are entitled to adjudicate the rights and\nobligations of only the litigants before them. See Texas, 599 U.S. at 693-94 (Gorsuch, J.,\nconcurring). Others, however, defend nationwide injunctions, arguing that they have a longer\nhistorical pedigree in the courts of equity than is commonly acknowledged, and that they are\nsometimes necessary as the only way effectively to check unlawful governmental power. See, e.g.,\nCity of Chicago v. Barr, 961 F.3d 882, 912-18 (7th Cir. 2020); see generally Amanda Frost, In\nDefense of Nationwide Injunctions, 93 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 1065 (2018).\n\nUltimately, it is not the function of this Court to determine which side has the better of the\nargument. Instead, the Court\u2019s responsibility is to follow the controlling precedent of the Supreme\nCourt and the Fourth Circuit, and\u2014when appropriate\u2014to exercise its equitable jurisdiction within\nthe contours defined by that binding law. In this Circuit, the law is clear: \u201cA district court may\nissue a nationwide injunction so long as the court molds its decree to meet the exigencies of the\nparticular case.\u201d HIAS, Inc. v. Trump, 985 F.3d 309, 326 (4th Cir. 2021) (cleaned up). Such relief\nmay be appropriate when (1) the challenged policy is a \u201ccategorical\u201d one and (2) \u201cthe facts would\nnot require different relief for others similarly situated to the plaintiffs.\u201d Jd; see also Roe, 947\nF.3d at 232 (affirming \u201cthe equitable power of district courts, in appropriate cases, to issue\nnationwide injunctions extending relief to those who are similarly situated to the litigants\u201d). That\nsaid, however, the Court will not lose sight of the bedrock principle that \u201cinjunctive relief should\nbe no more burdensome to the defendant than necessary to provide complete relief to the\nplaintiffs.\u201d Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U.S. 682, 702 (1979).\n\nDetermining the proper geographic scope of relief in this case is complicated by the\nstatutory and regulatory regime at issue. As discussed earlier in this Memorandum, see supra\n\nSection [V.A.4.1i, the competitive areas that must be defined prior to any RIF do not map neatly\n\n69\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document125 Filed 04/01/25 Page 72 of 84\n\nonto state boundaries. A competitive area eit (and, in many cases, inevitably will) encompass\nmultiple states or even the entire country, and federal workers often live in one state and work in\nanother. The RIF framework was clearly not designed to follow state boundaries. Instead, it\ncontemplates region-wide\u2014and in some cases nationwide\u2014planning and coordination through,\namong other things, the identification of competitive areas.\n\nHere, the Government has wholly failed to define these competitive areas. And the Court\ncannot do the Government\u2019s job for it. Thus, the simplest way to ensure that the Plaintiff States\nare alleviated from the burden of ongoing RIFs, and that they receive adequate notice of any future\nRIFs, would simply be to stay the Government\u2019s likely unlawful RIFs throughout the country and\nrequire the Government to fully comply with the RIF procedures nationwide for any future RIFs.\nA nationwide approach would also advance the values of uniformity, consistency, and rationality\nin the federal workforce, as opposed to the inevitable fragmentation and confusion that will\naccompany state-specific relief.\n\nBut these considerations, while powerful, are ultimately not persuasive when balanced\nagainst the negatives of a nationwide injunction and given the reality that more narrowly tailored\nrelief is feasible. Ultimately, the Court concludes that a \u00a7 705 stay and preliminary injunctive\nrelief are warranted only with respect to employees who live or work in Plaintiff States.\u201d\u00b0\n\nThis subnational scope of relief appropriately protects the Plaintiff States from irreparable\nharm. In particular, it covers and protects the Plaintiff States in three scenarios. The first and\nsimplest scenario involves a federal probationary employee who lives in a Plaintiff State and\n\nwhose duty station is also in a Plaintiff State. The second scenario involves a probationary\n\n0 The injunction will apply to a// Plaintiff States, as, for the purposes of the preliminary injunction stage,\nthe Court finds it more likely than not that each Plaintiff State was entitled to notice. See supra Section\nIV.A.4.\n\n70\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document125 Filed 04/01/25 Page 73 of 84\n\nemployee who works in a Plaintiff State but lives in a non-Plaintiff State\u2014for example, an\nemployee whose duty station is in Maryland but who resides in Virginia. (See, e.g., ECF No. 33-\n11 (declaration of probationary employee living in Virginia but working in Washington, D.C.).)\nThe Plaintiff States are entitled to be protected against mass layoffs of this category of workers,\nbecause, as the States explain in their second supplemental brief, federal employees are generally\nrequired to file for unemployment claims in the state of their duty station. (ECF No. 116 at 2\n(citing 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8504).) Thus, any mass layoffs of workers in this category would burden the\nPlaintiff States at least by inflicting costs associated with processing and paying out unemployment\nclaims. Finally, the third scenario involves a probationary employee who works in a non-Plaintiff\nState but who lives in a Plaintiff State\u2014for example, a worker whose duty station is in Virginia\nbut who resides in Maryland. (See, e.g., ECF No. 33-13 (declaration of probationary employee\nliving in California but whose \u201cclosest geographic headquarters\u201d was in Texas).) The Government\nargues that relief should not be extended to cover this situation. (ECF No. 117 at 3.) The Court\nconcludes, however, that the Plaintiff States are also entitled to protection against mass layoffs of\nthis category of workers, as workers generally turn to their state of residence for a variety of social\nservices when they are terminated. (See, e.g, ECF No. 116 at 2 (citing Maryland state\nregulations).) And, as the Court has already explained, see supra Section IV.A.4.iii, a state\u2019s rapid-\nresponse obligations under the WIOA appear to be triggered whenever there is a mass layoff of\nindividuals who work or reside in that state.\n\nThe Court is not persuaded that a nationwide injunction is warranted with respect to a\nfourth category\u2014individuals who both live and work in a non-Plaintiff State. The Court has\nendeavored to make the injunction as minimally intrusive as possible while preventing irreparable\n\nharm to the States, keeping in mind once again \u201cthat the Government has traditionally been given\n\n71\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document125 Filed 04/01/25 Page 74 of 84\n\nthe widest latitude in fie dispatch of its own internal affairs.\u201d Sampson, 415 U.S. at 83 (internal\nquotation marks and citation omitted). The States raise a concern that \u201c{i]f the Court only\nreinstates probationary employees in the Plaintiff States, employees in the Plaintiff States will face\na greater likelihood of being subject to the upcoming RIFs than they would if all probationary\nemployees were reinstated.\u201d (ECF No. 116 at 1.) But the States do not actually explain how this\nconcern would materialize. Without a stronger showing of the need for nationwide relief, the\nCourt concludes that the more appropriate course is relief tailored to the Plaintiff States.\n\nA nationwide injunction would of course offer benefits in terms of consistency throughout\nthe country. But a \u201cgeneral interest of national uniformity\u201d is not enough, as \u201cnonuniformity is a\ndeliberate feature of our federal court system.\u201d Georgia v. President of the United States, 46 F.4th\n1283, 1307 (11th Cir. 2022). Even assuming that a nationwide injunction is the only way to\nguarantee with absolute certainty that Plaintiffs States will not suffer any irreparable harm during\nthe pendency of this action, the Court does not just mechanically award the full scope of relief\nrequested when a party prevails under the Winter factors. The Court exercises its \u201cdiscretion and\njudgment,\u201d Lackey, 145 S. Ct. at 667 (citation omitted), recognizing always that a preliminary\ninjunction is an \u201cextraordinary remedy never awarded as of right,\u201d Winter, 555 U.S. at 24. If even\nthe most run-of-the-mill preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy, a nationwide\ninjunction is surely even more so. When faced with such a super-extraordinary request, the Court\nmust \u201cpay particular regard for the public consequences\u201d of the relief it orders. /d.\n\nHere, broadening the scope of the injunction beyond the Plaintiff States offers diminishing\nreturn in terms of preventing harm to the Plaintiffs. In other words, an injunction tailored only to\nthe Plaintiff States will prevent the vast majority of the harm they could suffer, while admittedly\n\nleaving them exposed to some possibility of unredressed harm. By contrast, a nationwide\n\n72\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document125 Filed 04/01/25 Page 75 of 84\n\ninjunction would provide only a small quantum of additional redress to Plaintiff States, but would\nbring with it all the downsides of nationwide injunctions that legal commentators and judges both\nwithin this Circuit and on the Supreme Court have so thoroughly catalogued.\n\nThe harms that flow to the Plaintiff States from the Government\u2019s actions, as catalogued\nabove, arise from the obligations that each State owes to its residents and people employed in that\nState. Simply put, a state is not harmed\u2014at least not in a cognizable way\u2014by unnoticed mass\n\n21 In other words, Maryland has not\n\nlayoffs of people who both live and work in another state.\nshown how it will suffer irreparable harm if the Government terminates probationary employees\nworking and residing in Virginia without giving notice to Virginia. Thus, in order to preserve the\nstatus quo and prevent irreparable harm to the Plaintiff States, it is enough for the Court (1) to stay\nthe terminations of employees in those States and (2) to enjoin the Government from conducting\nen masse terminations of employees working and/or residing in those States, except in accordance\nwith the lawful RIF procedures.\n\nMoreover, the scope of the Court\u2019s relief is a function of which states chose to participate\nin this action. The decision of a state as to whether to sue the federal government is a\nquintessentially political one\u2014one that no court should lightly render irrelevant. In this situation,\n\nwhen the Court must presume that the decision of the non-Plaintiff States not to participate was a\n\nconscious one, the Court declines to go further and \u201cgrant[] supposed \u2018relief? to absent persons\n\n*! Of course, a state might, as a matter of economic reality, be harmed by mass layoffs of residents of a\nneighboring state. For example, if many Virginia residents lose their (Virginia-based) jobs, that may\ntranslate into fewer Virginians patronizing shops and restaurants in neighboring Washington, D.C., and\nMaryland, which in turn could eventually lead to reduced tax revenue for those jurisdictions. But this kind\nof injury is almost certainly too attenuated and generalized to be cognizable. See Florida v. Mellon, 273\nU.S. 12, 17-18 (1927).\n\n73\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document125 Filed 04/01/25 Page 76 of 84\n\nwho had asked for no such \u2018relief\u2019 and might not want it.\u201d Georgia, 46 F.4th at 1308 (Edmondson,\nJ., concurring).\u201d\u201d\n\nThe Court pauses to make one final note on the geographic scope of relief. It may be the\ncase that, as a practical matter, the Government determines that the most efficient method of\ncomplying with the Court\u2019s order is to change its hiring and firing policies throughout the United\nStates, rather than trying to disentangle its RIF procedures as they affect Plaintiff States from those\nas they affect employees living and working in the rest of the country. But that is a decision the\nGovernment can make, not one that the Court will force upon it.\n\nC. Content of Injunction & Nature of Relief\n\nThe injunction that will issue today has two basic components. One is a stay, pursuant to\nAPA \u00a7 705, of the likely unlawful mass terminations, without notice, of probationary employees\nwho either live or work in the Plaintiff States.2> The second component is a preliminary injunction\nbarring Defendants from terminating en masse any federal probationary employees who live or\n\nwork in a Plaintiff State, except pursuant to the RIF statute and regulations. This preliminary\n\n> The Court previously stated that anything less than nationwide relief would be \u201cinequitable\u201d to\nprobationary employees, as \u201can individual federal employee\u2019s job status would depend on the fortuity of\ntheir physical location.\u201d (TRO Mem. at 50.) And the Fourth Circuit has suggested that a district court may,\nin weighing the scope of injunctive relief, appropriately consider the unfairness of less-than-national relief\nto nonparties. See HIAS, 985 F.3d at 327 (stating that enjoining a challenged policy \u201conly as to the plaintiff\nresettlement agencies would cause inequitable treatment of [nonparty] refugees\u201d). The Court continues to\ngive due regard to this consideration. However, in this case, any potential unfairness is outweighed by the\nconsiderations militating against a nationwide injunction.\n\n*3 As the Court previously explained, the ordinary provisional remedy in APA cases is that the unlawful\nagency action is stayed in its entirety, not that the action is stayed only as to the plaintiffs. This approach\ncan be seen most clearly in bread-and-butter APA cases in which an agency regulation is stayed in its\nentirety. See, e.g., Texas v. EPA, 829 F.3d 405, 435 (Sth Cir. 2016); Cook County v. Wolf, 498 F. Supp. 3d\n999, 1006-07 (N.D. Ill. 2020). In this case, the agency action at issue is not a rule or even the likely\nunlawful scheme as a whole, but rather each individual instance of a federal worker being terminated\npursuant to a likely unlawful RIF without notice to the Plaintiff States. Each such instance will be stayed.\nHowever, because any likely unlawful firings of probationary employees who both live and work in non-\nPlaintiff States do not cognizably harm the Plaintiffs, they are not the subject of this Court\u2019s ruling.\n\n74\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document125 Filed 04/01/25 Page 77 of 84\n\ninjunction is necessary to prevent irreparable harm and preserve the status quo ante\u2014\u2018\u201cnot the\ncircumstances existing at the moment the lawsuit or injunction request was actually filed, but the\nlast uncontested status between the parties which preceded the controversy.\u201d (TRO Mem. at 47\n(quoting Aggarao v. MOL Ship Mgmt. Co., 675 F.3d 355, 378 (4th Cir. 2012)).)** Together, this\nrelief will relieve the Plaintiff States from bearing further irreparable harms associated with the\nsudden influx of unemployed workers as a result of unnoticed RIFs, as documented supra Section\nIII.A.1.i. With the unlawfully terminated probationary employees returned to the Government\u2019s\nemploy, the Plaintiff States will no longer be forced to bear the administrative and financial costs\nof playing catch-up on their rapid-response and other obligations. This relief does not prevent\nfuture RIFs but simply requires that any RIF be done in accordance with the law, so that the\nPlaintiff States can prepare accordingly.\n\nFurther, the Court is unpersuaded by the Government\u2019s argument that the Court cannot\norder reinstatement on the grounds that this remedy was not traditionally available in equity. (See\nECF No. 101 at 26-27.) For one thing, the Court is not ordering that the Government return\naffected probationary employees to their actual job duties, nor is the Court ordering the\nGovernment to reappoint people whose terms of service have lapsed. Instead, the Court is simply\nstaying the terminations as likely \u201cvoid ab initio.\u201d See Wilcox v. Trump, __ F. Supp. 3d___, Civ.\nNo. 25-334 (BAH), 2025 WL 720914, at *16 (D.D.C. Mar. 6, 2025), stayed on other grounds sub\nnom. Harris v. Bessent, Nos. 25-5037, 25-5055, 25-5057, 2025 U.S. App. LEXIS 7301 (D.C. Cir.\nMar. 28, 2025). Such an order, of course, necessarily results in de facto reinstatement to the\n\nGovernment\u2019s fully paid employ (whether on active duty or on leave), but this practical reality\n\n** The Court incorporates and ratifies the discussion regarding the nature of the status quo ante in the TRO\nMemorandum. (TRO Mem. at 46-48.)\n\n75\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document125 Filed 04/01/25 Page 78 of 84\n\ndoes not place the order outside the remit of the Court\u2019s injunctive authority. See id. (citing\nSeverino v. Biden, 71 F.4th 1038, 1042-43 (D.C. Cir. 2023)). Moreover, even assuming that the\nstay would be considered reinstatement in both a de facto and a formal sense, such a remedy against\nthe federal government is permissible and consonant with historical practice. See id.; McNeill v.\nButz, 480 F.2d 314, 317 (4th Cir. 1973) (holding that a former USDA employee was entitled to\nreinstatement); Am. Postal Workers Union v. U.S. Postal Serv., 830 F.2d 294, 312 (D.C. Cir. 1987)\n(holding that a federal employee was \u201centitled to reinstatement with full back pay\u201d); Harris v.\nBessent, Civ. No. 25-412 (RC), 2025 WL 679303, at *10 (D.D.C. Mar. 4, 2025), stayed on other\ngrounds, Nos. 25-5037, 25-5055, 25-5057, 2025 U.S. App. LEXIS 7301 (D.C. Cir. Mar. 28, 2025).\nAs the United States District Court for the District of Columbia recently explained in detail:\n\nHistorically, requests for reinstatement were styled as writs of mandamus or guo\nwarranto before courts of law instead of requests for injunctions before courts of\nequity, as defendants\u2019 cited cases reflect. See In re Sawyer, 124 U.S. 200, 212\n(1888) (noting that while a court of equity does not have \u201cjurisdiction over the\nappointment and removal of public officers,... the courts of law, ... either by\ncertiorari, error, or appeal, or by mandamus, prohibition, quo warranto, or\ninformation in the nature of a writ of guo warranto\u201d do); White v. Berry, 171 U.S.\n366, 377 (1898) (same). After the merger of law and equity in the federal courts\nover eighty years ago, however, that distinction makes no difference and does not\nrender improper the injunctive relief plaintiff requests.\n\nUnsurprisingly, many courts have, therefore, reinstated federal employees to their\npositions or prevented their removals from taking effect. See, e.g., Vitarelli v.\nSeaton, 359 U.S. 535, 546 (1959) (\u201c[P]etitioner is entitled to the reinstatement\nwhich he seeks.\u201d); Pelicone v. Hodges, 320 F.2d 754, 757 (D.C. Cir. 1963) (holding\nthat plaintiff was \u201centitled to reinstatement\u201d); Paroczay v. Hodges, 219 F. Supp.\n89, 94 (D.D.C. 1963) (holding that, because plaintiff \u201cwas never legally separated,\u201d\nthe court \u201cwill therefore order plaintiff's reinstatement\u2019); [Berry v. Reagan, Civ.\nNo. 83-3182, 1983 WL 538, at *6 (D.D.C. 1983)] (enjoining removal of members\nof the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights); cf Sampson v. Murray, 415 U.S. 61, 92\nn.68 (1974) (acknowledging that \u201c[uJse of the court\u2019s injunctive power\u201d may be\nappropriate in certain cases regarding discharge of employees). The other cases\ncited by defendants for the principle that reinstatement is not available as equitable\nrelief, involve the unique situation of federal courts presiding over questions about\nstate officers\u2019 entitlement to their positions, which is wholly inapplicable\nhere. See Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 231 (1962) (citing cases about \u201cenjoin[ing]\n\n76\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document125 Filed 04/01/25 Page 79 of 84\n\na state proceeding to remove a public officer\u201d); Walton v.

There, a probationary employee working for GSA was terminated, purportedly because\nof poor on-the-job performance. Jd. at 64. However, she contended that the real reason for her\nfiring had to do with actions arising before her appointment, and that she did not receive the\nprocedural protections to which a probationer terminated for that reason is entitled under 5 C.F.R.\n\u00a7 315.806(c). Id. at 64-65. She filed an administrative appeal, and while that appeal was pending,\nshe also filed an action directly in federal district court. Jd. at 66. The district court granted a\npreliminary injunction staying her termination, and the D.C. Circuit affirmed. Jd at 67. The\nSupreme Court reversed, but for reasons that are wholly inapposite to this case. The main problem\n\nin Sampson, as the Supreme Court saw it, was that the district court granted preliminary relief\n\n*\u2019 The Wilcox decision\u2019s statement that the question of whether reinstatement was traditionally awarded by\ncourts of law or courts of equity \u201cmakes no difference\u201d is perhaps questionable given the rule that injunctive\nrelief under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65 is limited to relief that \u201cwas traditionally accorded by courts\nof equity.\u201d Grupo Mexicano de Desarrolo S.A. v. Alliance Bond Fund, Inc., 527 U.S. 308, 319 (1999).\nBut, even assuming that Wilcox is indeed wrong on this point, and even assuming further that the stay of\nthe terminations is equivalent to reinstatement both de facto and as a matter of law, the Court\u2019s authority to\norder reinstatement would still be unaffected. That is so because the Court\u2019s injunctive authority in this\ncontext stems not only from Rule 65 and the general grant of equitable jurisdiction to the district courts, see\nid, at 318, but also from 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 705. And the Court sees no reason to conclude that \u00a7 705 is limited to\nrelief traditionally available at equity. After all, \u00a7 705 does not by its terms even reference the concept of\nequity or equitable relief, but instead authorizes courts to \u201cissue all necessary and appropriate process to\npostpone the effective date of an agency action or to preserve status or rights pending conclusion of the\nreview proceedings.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 705. The statute\u2019s lack of any reference to equitable relief distinguishes\n\u00a7 705 from other statutory remedy provisions expressly authorizing \u201cequitable relief,\u201d which the Supreme\nCourt has generally read to be limited to \u201cthose categories of relief that were typically available in equity.\u201d\nLiu v. SEC, 591 U.S. 71, 78-79 (2020) (interpreting 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u(d)(5) and quoting Mertens v. Hewitt\nAssocs., 508 U.S. 248, 256 (1993) (interpreting section 502(a)(3) of the Employment Retirement Income\nSecurity Act (\u201cERISA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(3))).\n\n77\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document125 Filed 04/01/25 Page 80 of 84\n\nwithout ever finding that the plaintiff was actually likely to suffer irreparable harm, apparently on\nthe erroneous belief that the possibility of irreparable harm was enough. Jd. at 88-89. The\nSupreme Court\u2019s view of the record led it to conclude that the plaintiff fell \u201cfar short of\u201d the\nnecessary irreparable harm showing, given that she could obtain backpay if she ultimately\nprevailed. Id. at 90-92.\n\nIn reaching this conclusion, the Supreme Court embarked on a lengthy disquisition about\nthe authority of federal courts to enjoin the terminations of federal workers. Sampson, 415 U.S. at\n68-84.*\u00b0 In that discussion, the Court noted earlier authority providing that courts of equity could\nnot enjoin the wrongful termination of a federal employee, but then went on to observe that\n\u201c[m]uch water has flowed over the dam\u201d since then. /d at 71. More recent cases, the Court\nobserved, reveal that federal courts \u201cdo have authority to review the claim of a discharged\ngovernmental employee that the agency effectuating the discharge has not followed administrative\nregulations.\u201d /d. (citing Service v. Dulles, 354 U.S. 363 (1957)). Ultimately, the Court declined\nto \u201chold that Congress has wholly foreclosed the granting of preliminary injunctive relief in such\ncases,\u201d but instead insisted that such relief must be premised on a sufficiently strong showing of\nirreparable injury. Jd. at 83-84. The most favorable reading of Sampson for the Government,\nthen, is not that such relief is unavailable, but simply that such relief be limited to \u201cextraordinary\n\nsituation[s]\u201d rather than \u201croutine case[s].\u201d Harris, 2025 WL 679303, at *10 (quoting Sampson,\n\n*\u00b0 There were other problems in Sampson that further distinguish that case from this one. In Sampson, the\nplaintiff sought judicial review while the administrative appeal was pending. The Supreme Court expressed\ngreat reluctance to allow the judiciary to engage in \u201cobviously disruptive\u201d interference with the\nadministrative process by allowing the federal court litigation to proceed, when it was entirely possible that\nthat administrative process would grant the plaintiff all the relief to which she was entitled. 415 U.S. at 83.\nThe case has thus also been read to stand for the proposition that employees must exhaust administrative\nremedies before seeking injunctive relief. Gaballah v. Johnson, 629 F.2d 1191, 1199 (7th Cir. 1980). Here,\nthere is no pending administrative review that the States are attempting to short-circuit\u2014and, as the Court\nhas explained, there is no administrative review process the States could seek. (See TRO Mem. at 28-30.)\n\n78\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document125 Filed 04/01/25 Page 81 of 84\n\n415 U.S. at 92 n.68).*\u201d The case certainly does not stand for the proposition that reinstatement is\ncategorically unavailable as a remedy. Jd.; see also Marsden v. U.S. Postal Serv., 390 F. Supp.\n329, 336-37 (D. Minn. 1974).\n\nFinally, the Court turns to the remedies that the Government suggests would be appropriate\nin the event that the Court determines the States are entitled to relief. These alternative remedies\nare nonsensical. One suggestion appears to be that the States\u2019 injuries be remedied simply by\ngiving them the notice to which they were originally entitled. (See ECF No. 101 at 14-15.) But\nthe states are not entitled to \u201cnotice\u201d in the abstract, untethered to other requirements. Instead,\nthey are entitled to sixty days of notice (or thirty days if an exception is validly invoked), which\ngives them time to prepare for the onslaught of terminated workers. And that notice can be\nprovided only afier the Government has already determined the competitive areas, which has not\nhappened here. As the Court has already explained in its standing analysis, see supra Section\nIIl.A, simply giving the Plaintiff States notice now is not even closing the stable door after the\nhorse has bolted. Instead, it is warning the stable hand that the door should be closed after the\nhorse is long gone.\n\nThe second suggestion is even further afield. The Government contends that the States\ncould \u201cseek some sort of declaratory judgment about their obligations under the Workforce\nInvestment Act.\u201d (ECF No. 117-1 at 38; see also ECF No. 117 at 2 (\u201c[A]ny remedy for the States\n\nshould not go beyond a declaration with respect to States\u2019 federal-law rapid-response\n\n* It is doubtful whether, after Winter, the heightened \u201cextraordinary situation\u201d requirement for preliminary\ninjunctions in this context still applies. See Roe v. Shanahan, 359 F. Supp. 3d 382, 419 (E.D. Va. 2019),\naff'd sub nom. Roe v. Dep't of Defense, 947 F.3d 207 (4th Cir. 2020). But assuming arguendo that the\nStates must make such a showing, they have done so here. The Government apparently engaged in mass\nterminations without even attempting to follow a detailed statutory and regulatory scheme, and it blithely\ncast the burden of these actions on wholly unprepared states. This is an extraordinary and\u2014so far as the\nCourt is aware\u2014unprecedented state of affairs.\n\n79\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document125 Filed 04/01/25 Page 82 of 84\n\nobligations.\u201d).) In essence, the Government proposes that the Court issue a declaratory judgment\nrelieving Plaintiff States of their obligations to follow federal law. But even if the Court issued\nsuch a judgment at the conclusion of this case, that would do nothing to redress the harms that the\nStates are suffering right now and will likely suffer in the immediate future, as detailed supra\nSection III.A.1. In any event, there is an even more fundamental problem with the Government\u2019s\nsuggestion. It is a matter of grave doubt if this would even be a permissible invocation of the\nCourt\u2019s declaratory judgment authority. The Declaratory Judgment Act permits a court, in\nappropriate circumstances, to \u201cdeclare the rights and other legal relations of any interested party\nseeking such declaration,\u201d not to waive such rights and obligations. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201(a). Even in\nthe unlikely event that the Court could issue such a declaratory judgment, it would not do so. The\nCourt is tasked with applying the law as Congress wrote it, not in rewriting the law wholesale\nwhen convenient for the Government. The Court is aware of no authority for the startling\nproposition that a court may remedy a defendant\u2019s violation of a federal law by authorizing a\nplaintiff to violate a totally separate federal law. In the law, two wrongs do not make a right.\nVI. SECURITY/BOND REQUIREMENT\n\nUnder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(c), a court may issue a preliminary injunction\n\u201conly if the movant gives security in an amount that the court considers proper to pay the costs\nand damages sustained by any party found to have been wrongfully enjoined or restrained.\u201d As\nthe Court previously explained, \u201cdistrict courts have discretion to set the required security at a\nnominal amount, and this approach has long been followed in public-interest litigation cases.\u201d\n(TRO Mem. at 54 (cleaned up) (collecting cases).) The Court adopted that approach at the TRO\nstage, setting a bond of $100 per Plaintiff State while explaining that (1) \u201cthe potential cost of an\n\nimprovidently granted TRO on the federal government is too complex to calculate in this expedited\n\n80\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document125 Filed 04/01/25 Page 83 of 84\n\nproceeding\u201d and (2) \u201ceven if a dollar amount could be put on the Government\u2019s actions, it would\nbe prohibitive to require [P]laintiffs to bear up front the total cost of the alleged governmental\nwrongdoing.\u201d (/d. at 55.) As the Fourth Circuit has explained,\n{i]n fixing the amount of an injunction bond, the district court should be guided by\nthe purpose underlying Rule 65(c), which is to provide a mechanism for\nreimbursing an enjoined party for harm it suffers as a result of an improvidently\nissued injunction or restraining order. The amount of the bond, then, ordinarily\ndepends on the gravity of the potential harm to the enjoined party: \u201c[T]he judge\nusually will fix security in an amount that covers the potential incidental and\nconsequential costs as well as either the losses the unjustly enjoined or restrained\nparty will suffer during the period he is prohibited from engaging in certain\n\nactivities or the complainant\u2019s unjust enrichment caused by his adversary being\nimproperly enjoined or restrained.\u201d\n\nHoechst Diafoil Co. v. Nan Ya Plastics Corp., 174 F.3d 411, 421 n.3 (4th Cir. 1999) (citing Wright\n& Miller \u00a7 2954 (2d ed. 1995)).\n\nThe Government cites to this passage, and protests that the bond imposed at the TRO stage\n\u201cbears no relation to the costs imposed on Defendants as a result of the TRO.\u201d (ECF No. 101 at\n30.) The Court acknowledges that the Government may not be able to recoup the costs it will incur\nin the event that the preliminary injunction is later determined to have been improvidently granted.\nBut the Government has not provided the Court with any quantitative estimate as to the costs\nimposed on it by any injunction, and the Court is no position to make such a calculation on its\nown. Moreover, the Government does not even acknowledge\u2014let alone attempt to distinguish\u2014\nthe very next sentence of Hoechst Diafoil, in which the Fourth Circuit stated that \u201c[w]here the\ndistrict court determines that the risk of harm is remote, or that the circumstances otherwise warrant\nit, the court may fix the amount of the bond accordingly. /n some circumstances, a nominal bond\nmay suffice.\u201d 174 F.3d at 421 n.3 (emphasis added). Indeed, \u201cthe district court retains the\ndiscretion to set the bond amount as it sees fit or waive the security requirement,\u201d so long as it\n\n\u201cexpressly address[es] the issue of security before allowing any waiver\u201d and does not \u201cdisregard\n\n81\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document125 Filed 04/01/25 Page 84 of 84\n\nthe bond requirement altogether.\u201d Pashby v. Delia, 709 F.3d 307, 332 (4th Cir. 2013) (citation\nomitted). Other circuit courts have reached the same conclusion. See, e.g., Barahona-Gomez v.\nReno, 167 F.3d 1228, 1237 (9th Cir. 1999) (collecting cases). And, as the Court already explained,\na nominal bond is common in public-interest litigation cases, as requiring plaintiffs to \u201cbear up\nfront the total cost of the alleged governmental wrongdoing\u201d will often be effectively to foreclose\njudicial review altogether. (TRO Mem. at 54-55.)\n\nThe Court sees no basis for departing from its earlier conclusion that a nominal bond is\nappropriate. For these reasons, and for the reasons stated in the TRO Memorandum, (see id. at\n54-55), the Court will continue to require the Plaintiff States to provide security in the amount of\n$100 each.\n\nVil. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the reasons stated herein, the Motion for Section 705 Stay and Preliminary Injunction,\n(ECF No. 78), will be granted in part, and a Preliminary Injunction will issue. Now overtaken by\na Preliminary Injunction, the previously entered TRO (which in any event would have expired at\n\n8:00 p.m. tonight) will be vacated.\n\nDated this _// day of April, 2025 at vi2e PM. EDT\n\nBY THE COURT:\n\nLQame A Pardr\n\nJames K. Bredar\nUnited States District Judge\n\n82\n",

The Court additionally directed\n\nthat \u201c[t]he parties must address the situation in which (1) a probationary employee resides in one\n\nstate but works in another and (2) only one such state is a party.\u201d Id.\n\n        Defendants maintain that \u201cto protect the interests of these . . . governmental units,\u201d which\n\nare \u201cnot persons,\u201d a preliminary injunction should not include the reinstatement of employees. Tr.\n\n20:1:7. Section 3502 has a parallel statute in the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification\n\nAct (WARN Act) that is applicable to some private employers. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2102. That statute\n\nrequires notice to States where \u201ca plant closing or mass layoff\u201d occurs. Id. It expressly addresses\n\nremedies for a violation of the notice provision, giving \u201caggrieved employee[s]\u201d a right to bring a\n\ncivil action against employers for damages and a penalty. Id. \u00a7 2104(a). A \u201cunit of local\n\n\n                                                 1\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 117        Filed 03/27/25       Page 2 of 7\n\n\n\ngovernment\u201d is authorized to bring an action to seek a \u201ccivil penalty\u201d in some cases. Id.\n\n\u00a7 2104(a)(3). The statute affords States no remedy. And no one may sue to reinstate an employee.\n\nUnited Steelworks of Am., AFL-CIO-CLC v. Crown Cork & Seal Co., Inc., 32 F.3d 53, 59 n.2 (3d\n\nCir. 1994); Bentley v. Arlee Home Fashions, Inc., 861 F. Supp. 65, 68 (E.D. Ark. 1994). Unlike\n\nthe WARN Act, Section 3502 authorizes no remedies for employees, States, or local government\n\nunits. Plaintiffs wrongly read that silence to authorize the anomalous federal court remedy of\n\nfederal employee reinstatement. As Defendants noted at yesterday\u2019s hearing, any remedy for the\n\nStates should not go beyond a declaration with respect to States\u2019 federal-law rapid-response\n\nobligations.\n\n       If, however, the Court concludes that reinstatement is a necessary ingredient of any\n\npreliminary injunction, the injunction should encompass only those terminated probationers that\n\n(i) worked (i.e., had their duty station) within a Plaintiff State; (ii) where that specific Plaintiff\n\nState has obligations under the Workforce Investment of Act of 1998 / Workforce Innovation and\n\nOpportunity Act of 2014 (as contemplated in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502)(d)); and (iii) where that specific\n\nPlaintiff State would have been entitled to receive notice specifically for (any) reduction in force\n\nat the specific Defendant agency from which the probationer was terminated. Each of these must\n\nbe met for the proposed preliminary injunction to encompass any Affected Probationary Employee.\n\n(i)    Affected Probationary Employees must have been employed within a Plaintiff State\n       to be Encompassed Within any Preliminary Injunction.\n\n       Any preliminary injunction should encompass only those Affected Probationary\n\nEmployees who worked in a Plaintiff State at the time of their removal.\n\n       During yesterday\u2019s hearing, plaintiffs asserted that in the case of a terminated probationer,\n\nwho lives or resides in one state, but who had their \u201cduty station\u201d in another state (i.e., had worked\n\nfor one of the federal agency defendants in that other state, prior to termination), that individual\n\f          Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB               Document 117           Filed 03/27/25          Page 3 of 7\n\n\n\nwould be entitled to claim potential unemployment insurance claims from the state where he/she\n\nworked prior to termination. See, e.g., Tr. 14:1-7. Defendants believe that this is generally\n\ncorrect.1 But this simply means that the Affected Probationary Employee, at a minimum, must\n\nhave worked within one of the Plaintiff States to potentially be covered by the proposed\n\ninjunction\u2014based on Plaintiffs\u2019 own theory of harm based on unemployment benefits.\n\n          To illustrate, consider a terminated probationer who resides in Maryland, but who (prior to\n\ntermination) worked for one of the defendant agencies in Virginia (i.e., the location of their \u201cduty\n\nstation\u201d). That terminated probationer (as a Marylander) evidently would be eligible to potentially\n\nclaim unemployment insurance in Virginia.2 But Virginia is not a Plaintiff State, and is not\n\nclaiming any harm. See Tr. 23: 20-21 (\u201c31 states presumably looked at this issue and decided not\n\nto join the case.\u201d). Therefore, it would be inappropriate to \u2018count\u2019 that employee, in terms of harm\n\narising from unemployment insurance claims.\n\n          Conversely, consider an Affected Probationary Employee who lives in Virgina, but who\n\nworked for a Restrained Defendant with a duty station in Maryland. That Affected Probationary\n\n\n\n\n1\n  See, e.g., U.S. Department of Labor website on unemployment insurance program, explaining, \u201cGenerally, you\nshould file your claim with the state where you worked.\u201d Available at:\nhttps://www.dol.gov/general/topic/unemployment-insurance (\u201cHow do I apply?\u201d)\n\n2\n    See, e.g., Unemployment Insurance in Maryland, A Guide to Reemployment, which explains:\n\n         Where to File for UI Benefits\n         Working Outside of Maryland \u2013 File your UI claim where you worked, not where you live. If all of\n         your work in the last 18 months was in a state other than Maryland, file your claim with that state.\n\nAvailable at: https://labor.maryland.gov/employment/clmtguide/uiclmtpamphlet.pdf\n\nWe also noted that the Maryland Department of Labor website now has information specially addressing\n\u201cUnemployment insurance for former federal employees,\u201d which explains: \u201cWorkers should apply for\nunemployment insurance (UI) benefits in the jurisdiction of their \u2018duty station.\u2019 This means, for example, that if you\nare a Marylander who is laid off from a job based in Virginia, you should apply for benefits in Virginia.\u201d\n\nAvailable at: https://labor.maryland.gov/employment/unemployment.shtml\n\f        Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB                 Document 117            Filed 03/27/25          Page 4 of 7\n\n\n\nEmployee would file an unemployment claim in Maryland (although residing in Virgina).3 In that\n\ncase\u2014assuming the other criteria (discussed further below) are met\u2014the contours of the proposed\n\ninjunction would include that Affected Probationary Employee residing in Virgina, based on\n\nPlaintiff States\u2019 theory of harm, insofar as unemployment claims.\n\n         In this light, the Affected Probationary Employee\u2019s station of duty (i.e., prior to\n\ntermination) is determinative in assessing any alleged harm incurred by the Plaintiff States, insofar\n\nas to unemployment insurance claims specifically. The contours of the proposed injunction\n\ntherefore should turn on whether the terminated employee\u2019s duty station is located in a Plaintiff\n\nState, given how unemployment insurance claims are paid. If, however, the Court concludes that\n\nboth an employee\u2019s duty station and place of residence are relevant, a preliminary injunction\n\nshould only include employees who live4 or work in Plaintiffs\u2019 States. Plaintiffs have not\n\narticulated a valid reason to extend injunctive relief to individuals who neither live nor work in\n\ntheir States.\n\n(ii)     Workforce Investment Act / Other Requirements\n\n         To fit within the contours of the proposed preliminary injunction, a Plaintiff State identified\n\nin the first requirement above also should have obligations under the Workforce Investment Act of\n\n1998 / Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act of 2014. As counsel for Defendants explained\n\nat the hearing, the Plaintiff States are suing on the basis of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d), which includes a\n\nnotice requirement so that States can carry out rapid response activities under section 134(a)(2)(A)\n\n\n\n\n3\n  The Viginia Employment Commission website explains, \u201cIf you now reside in Virginia but worked in another\nstate during the past 18 months, you may be able to file an Interstate Claim [with the relevant listed state.]\u201d See\nhttps://www.vec.virginia.gov/apply-benefits-out-state-list\n\n4\n Because injunctive relief must show \u201cdue regard for . . . feasibility,\u201d the Court should allow Defendants to\ndetermine the location of former employees\u2019 residence or worksite based on Defendants\u2019 records. Dep't of State v.\nAIDS Vaccine Advoc. Coal., 145 S. Ct. 753 (2025)\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 117         Filed 03/27/25      Page 5 of 7\n\n\n\nof the Workforce Investment Act / Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act of 2014. See Tr.\n\n23:25-24: 7.\n\n       The Plaintiff State identified likewise should be a State that was entitled to receive notice\n\nfor (any) reduction in force at the specific Defendant agency at which a probationer was\n\nterminated. Not all reductions in force (under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d)) require notice to the states.\n\nRather, the statute provides that the notice requirement is triggered only \u201cif the reduction in force\n\nwould involve the separation of a significant number of employees.\u201d (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d)(1)(B)).\n\nAnd OPM regulations, 5 CFR \u00a7 351.803 (Notice of eligibility for reemployment and other\n\nplacement assistance) provide that there is a significant number \u201cwhen 50 or more employees in a\n\ncompetitive area receive separation notices . . . .\u201d 5 CFR \u00a7 351.803(d). See Tr. 23:24-24:5.\n\nSimilarly, the Affected Probationary Employee should have been covered by the \u201ccompetitive\n\narea\u201d which triggered the reduction in force under CFR \u00a7 351.803(d).\n\n       Defendants respectfully submit that it remains Plaintiff States\u2019 burden to establish that they\n\nare entitled to relief. Importantly, they have not shown that they are entitled to reinstatement of\n\nemployees as a remedy. But even if that were a necessary remedy, injunctive relief should not go\n\nbeyond individuals working in this States\u2014or at least individuals working or living in their States.\n\n\n                                              Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                              YAAKOV ROTH\n                                              Acting Assistant Attorney General\n                                              Civil Division\n\n                                              ERIC J.

Good to see counsel\n\n 3        again.\n\n 4                 So let's introduce the matter.                                                         Plaintiffs, which include\n\n 5        19 states and the District of Columbia, filed suit against 41\n\n 6        defendants which included cabinet agencies, which I should say\n\n 7        include cabinet agencies, secretaries, other federal agencies,\n\n 8        the heads of those agencies.                                                 The states challenged the\n\n 9        Government's termination of probationary federal employees\n\n10        specifically asserting that rights and interests of the states\n\n11        themselves were compromised by the manner in which the Federal\n\n12        Government proceeded.                                     The states allege violations of the\n\n13        Administrative Procedures Act and they generally accuse the\n\n14        Government of engaging in activities that are ultra vires.\n\n15                 On March the 7th, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a\n\n16        Temporary Restraining Order.                                                 The Court held a hearing on\n\n17        March the 12th and then granted the motion and issued a TRO on\n\n18        March the 13th.                           The TRO has a duration of 14 days, and\n\n19        accordingly expires tomorrow at I think about 8:15 p.m.\n\n20                 On the 20th of March the states filed the motion that's\n\n21        technically before the Court now which is a request for a\n\n22        \u00a7 705 stay and a Preliminary Injunction.                                                                      The states have also\n\n23        asked that the TRO be extended.\n\n24                 The parties helpfully proposed a briefing schedule which\n\n25        the Court adopted and then after some activity in the Court of\n\n\n\n\n             Nadine M.

And the\n\n 4        parties complied and I've received your briefs and they're\n\n 5        docketed at papers 101 and 102 in the electronic case file.\n\n 6                 The Government separately filed a notice of appeal on the\n\n 7        14th of March.                         The Government sought an administrative stay\n\n 8        or a stay pending the resolution of the appeal.                                                                                  The Court of\n\n 9        Appeals denied the request and in fairness, their denial was\n\n10        tied to the following statement:                                                        Given the District Court's\n\n11        stated intention to hold a hearing on March 26, 2025 and to\n\n12        promptly grant or deny preliminary injunctive relief\n\n13        thereafter, the panel decided that it was appropriate to deny\n\n14        the request for a stay.                                         So that's my sense and understanding\n\n15        of where we are.\n\n16                 First of all, Ms. Williamson, any quarrel with the\n\n17        Court's statement of our procedural history and status?\n\n18                               MS.

Thank you.\n\n20                               THE COURT:                      Mr. Hamilton, how does it sound to you?\n\n21                               MR.

Well then let's go ahead and\n\n23        proceed.               The plaintiffs obviously go first.\n\n24                 Do you have any evidence or testimony you want to present\n\n25        today or merely argument?\n\n\n\n\n             Nadine M.

The analysis\n\n14        for a Temporary Restraining Order and a Preliminary Injunction\n\n15        as the Court knows are the same.                                                        The plaintiffs continue to\n\n16        meet all four factors.                                       They supplied even more argument --\n\n17        even more evidence indicating why a Preliminary Injunction is\n\n18        warranted at this stage.\n\n19                 I would like to address, in particular, three arguments\n\n20        of the defendant agencies in arguing against continued relief\n\n21        in this case at this preliminary stage.\n\n22                 First, the defendants' primary and truly only merits\n\n23        argument here is that these -- this mass termination of nearly\n\n24        25,000 people defendants say was not a reduction in force.\n\n25        Defendants say that instead, they describe it as in one point\n\n\n\n\n             Nadine M.

They describe it in another place in their brief\n\n 4        as a decision that paying the salaries is unwarranted given\n\n 5        the agency's current priorities.                                                        But Your Honor, all of these\n\n 6        descriptions no matter the term or phrase are RIFs, they are\n\n 7        reductions in force.\n\n 8                 We know that because there are regulatory provisions that\n\n 9        OPM established to tell an agency when it is conducting a\n\n10        reduction in force.                                  And one such occasion is a\n\n11        reorganization.                           That's the planned elimination, addition, or\n\n12        redistribution of functions or duties in an organization.                                                                                                  And\n\n13        \"function\" is defined in these regulations as all or a clearly\n\n14        identifiable segment of an agency's mission.\n\n15                 So if an agency alters its mission such that it needs to\n\n16        reduce the number of employees or change the positions of\n\n17        employees, that is by definition a reduction in force whether\n\n18        that is described by the express terms of the regulation or\n\n19        described in some other similar term.\n\n20                 So this is a reduction in force.                                                            The evidence -- not\n\n21        only does the regulation support that, but the evidence before\n\n22        the Court supports that.\n\n23                 The defendant agencies relatedly argue that they may have\n\n24        some freestanding, independent authority to fire probationary\n\n25        employees through a mechanism that isn't written in the\n\n\n\n\n             Nadine M.

The first is that if there were a mechanism to fire\n\n 4        probationary employees for no reason at all, for any reason,\n\n 5        it doesn't make sense that OPM would then have regulations\n\n 6        setting out specific procedures where certain types of\n\n 7        termination decisions were made.                                                        The defendant agencies would\n\n 8        merely every time say, I just want to fire this person if it\n\n 9        were that easy to fire a probationary employee for absolutely\n\n10        no reason.\n\n11                 But even more importantly, Your Honor, the evidence here\n\n12        today certainly does not suggest that the defendant agencies\n\n13        relied on some freestanding authority.                                                                  The evidence shows in\n\n14        the letters that the probationary employees received, as well\n\n15        as in the declarations of the hiring authorities at these\n\n16        agencies that these were decisions, these were purportedly\n\n17        decisions to terminate for cause because of performance\n\n18        issues.\n\n19                 So it's merely a post hoc rationalization to say that\n\n20        there's some sort of freestanding authority that the agencies\n\n21        might have apart from the OPM regulations.                                                                         There's no support\n\n22        for that in the record before you or in the regulations.\n\n23                 Your Honor, I'd also like to address defendants' argument\n\n24        on standing.

WILLIAMSON:                               Yes, Your Honor. So it seems they\n\n11        understood the direct link between the injuries that the\n\n12        states are suffering and the remedy here which is to remedy\n\n13        the harms that the state suffered because the defendant\n\n14        agencies went through these unlawful RIFs without notice.\n\n15                 So Laufer doesn't provide otherwise.                                                                   Informational\n\n16        injuries are a viable form of injury as the Court recognized\n\n17        in its TRO opinion.                                  And that is the sort of injury that the\n\n18        plaintiffs suffered here, along with downstream harms stemming\n\n19        from those injuries and they seek redress for those downstream\n\n20        harms.\n\n21                 The final issue I'd like to address with the Court is why\n\n22        uniform relief is warranted at this preliminary stage.\n\n23                 So the harms to the state, Your Honor, the plaintiff\n\n24        states' harms, they are integrated into what a RIF actually\n\n25        looks like in practice and the fact that there's no way to\n\n\n\n\n             Nadine M.

The majority of the states in the country have\n\n 6        not joined this lawsuit; only 19 did, plus DC.                                                                                And as the\n\n 7        Court has attempted to make clear at every opportunity when it\n\n 8        was appropriate to do so, that despite the views of some that\n\n 9        the employees themselves were treated unlawfully, cruelly,\n\n10        inappropriately, they are not parties in this case.                                                                                        They are\n\n11        not before this Court.                                       And to the extent that they were\n\n12        wronged, A, this Court makes no finding in this regard; and B,\n\n13        this isn't the forum.                                     They go elsewhere.\n\n14                 Other Courts have looked at it.                                                           The strong indication is\n\n15        that their remedy lies in an administrative agency, at least\n\n16        initially, in the Merit Systems Protection Board.                                                                                     This case\n\n17        is not The Probationary Employees v. The United States.

It is the states, the states that\n\n21        specifically sued.\n\n22                 So my question is how does a national injunction, uniform\n\n23        relief across the entire country or better yet, why is such an\n\n24        order, such an injunction, necessary to provide the relief\n\n25        that you contend the 19 states and DC are entitled to?

So, for example,\n\n10        the answer to Your Honor's question is that the plaintiff\n\n11        states' harms will continue if there's not uniform preliminary\n\n12        relief at this stage.\n\n13                               THE COURT:                      So show me how that is true.\n\n14                               MS. WILLIAMSON:                               Yes.            So, for example, as another\n\n15        example, an individual who works remotely, but lives in the\n\n16        state of California but works remotely in a state like Texas,\n\n17        not a plaintiff state.                                       If that individual remains --\n\n18                               THE COURT:                      So where do they live?\n\n19                               MS.

Okay, so they\n\n21        get laid off, they lose their job.                                                           The burden that is imposed\n\n22        on a state by virtue of that is imposed on the state of Texas.\n\n23                               MS.

The\n\n 7        duty station in California is covered, but if the Court were\n\n 8        to issue relief that did not include Texas where the person\n\n 9        lives but doesn't work, then the relief would not -- there\n\n10        would still be issues as to social services, coverage of other\n\n11        forms of provision of resources that the state has to provide.\n\n12                               THE COURT:                      Why?            He lives in Texas.                                     Texas is not\n\n13        complaining.                      Texas is apparently completely happy and their\n\n14        position is they didn't feel any impact or if they did, they\n\n15        didn't join this lawsuit.                                            And the federal probationary\n\n16        employees who happen to reside in Texas, they may be upset\n\n17        about their situation, but they're not parties to this case so\n\n18        their interests are not squarely before the Court.

Maybe they are going to have all\n\n20        kinds of burdens in the form of increased unemployment\n\n21        insurance claims, increased dependence on social services, et\n\n22        cetera.             But that's for Texas to decide and they have not\n\n23        asserted those interests, rights.

Explain to me the harms endured and\n\n 5        cast upon the state of California where the -- okay, let's\n\n 6        come up with a hypothetical so we've all got a better image of\n\n 7        it.      These are complex issues and they're hard to handle on\n\n 8        the fly, but I need help with this.\n\n 9                 So we've got an office that's in the state of California.\n\n10        Let's say it's the Bureau of Land Management, an agency of the\n\n11        United States Department of the Interior, a defendant in this\n\n12        case.          And the BLM has decided that they need IT assistance.\n\n13        And so they employ IT technicians, but IT work being what it\n\n14        is, even though this is the Bureau of Land Management, you\n\n15        don't actually have to be out on the land to do IT work for\n\n16        the BLM and the agency has made decisions that say it's okay\n\n17        for people to work remotely in this job.

But for whatever reasons they want to live in\n\n20        Dallas, Texas.                         And so they live in Dallas, Texas.

That's\n\n22        where their kids go to school and that's where they physically\n\n23        go to work every day in their home office and they have for\n\n24        years.

Within 24 hours I would like the\n\n 4        parties to supplement the record on that question of where do\n\n 5        -- where are remote workers by law to go to seek the panoply\n\n 6        of benefits that they might be entitled to as a suddenly\n\n 7        unemployed person.                                You can see my issue.\n\n 8                               MS.

There's a lot of things wrong\n\n11        with national injunctions just on a jurisprudential level.\n\n12        And courts and commentators are all over the issue and it's\n\n13        very current.                       That doesn't mean the Court won't enter one if\n\n14        the circumstances and law in this case compel it.\n\n15                               MS.

And I believe\n\n21        there are fact-specific circumstances warranted here as we've\n\n22        discussed, the effect on multiple states of a remote worker or\n\n23        a worker who works in one jurisdiction and lives in another,\n\n24        as well as, Your Honor, the defendants have indicated that\n\n25        they intend to continue to conduct RIFs in the future.

That might be\n\n 8        absolutely true and it might be completely chaotic and an\n\n 9        unintelligent way to run a national Government, but that's not\n\n10        the issue.                  The issue here is how their proceeding in that\n\n11        manner causes the 20 parties, the 20 plaintiffs in this case\n\n12        to experience less than the full remedy to which you contend\n\n13        they're entitled.\n\n14                               MS. WILLIAMSON:                               And it does, Your Honor, because\n\n15        the parties in this case would continue to perform rapid\n\n16        response services for people who live in other jurisdictions,\n\n17        but work within their jurisdiction.                                                             So, for example, the\n\n18        parties would have to sort of perform rapid response services\n\n19        for people who might not ultimately be terminated under proper\n\n20        RIF procedures.\n\n21                               THE COURT:                      Okay, so your example on that in the\n\n22        DC/Maryland/Virginia area would be residents of Maryland or DC\n\n23        who work at an agency in Northern Virginia and because\n\n24        Virginia is not a party and because the Court didn't issue a\n\n25        national injunction, the Government goes ahead and with no\n\n\n\n\n             Nadine M.

Is it impossible to craft an injunction that addresses\n\n12        that interest that you've described without it being a\n\n13        national injunction?\n\n14                               MS. WILLIAMSON:                               Your Honor, I think an injunction\n\n15        crafted more narrowly would lead to a situation where full\n\n16        relief couldn't be offered to the parties at the end of the\n\n17        case and would lead to a circumstance where at least in some\n\n18        instances, the plaintiff states would likely continue to\n\n19        suffer harm from their need to continue to provide for\n\n20        employees who are not reinstated who have some connection to\n\n21        their jurisdiction.\n\n22                               THE COURT:                      So I don't think this has been\n\n23        adequately addressed in the briefs and I'm going to expand\n\n24        what I said a moment ago in terms of the supplementation\n\n25        that's due at 10:00 tomorrow morning, and that is to this\n\n\n\n\n             Nadine M.

We would just\n\n11        ask that the Court enter the preliminary injunction.\n\n12                               THE COURT:                      Well, I have one more area that I want\n\n13        to get into and that is what technically triggers the\n\n14        obligation to give the notice?                                                    What triggers it?                                   Is it 50\n\n15        people in the competitive area?                                                      Is it 50 people in the state?\n\n16        And this is a complex question, particularly in densely packed\n\n17        metropolitan areas like the DC metropolitan area vis-a-vis\n\n18        Virginia.\n\n19                               MS.

And a competitive area can be defined to\n\n21        include up to the entire agency.                                                        So a competitive area may be\n\n22        Baltimore, but it may be, for example, all of the Department\n\n23        of Homeland Security.\n\n24                               THE COURT:                      So let's suppose that the office is in\n\n25        Alexandria.                    100 people -- 100 probationary workers work there\n\n\n\n\n             Nadine M.

But the competitive area for\n\n 4        purposes of my hypothetical it's defined as, you know, this\n\n 5        agency office or region which is headquartered in that office\n\n 6        in Alexandria.                         So no questions, more than 50 people involved.\n\n 7        There's 100 people involved, but the majority of them live in\n\n 8        Virginia; 60 of them.                                     Only 20 live in DC, only 20 live in\n\n 9        Maryland.                 Does Maryland as a state have notice rights in\n\n10        those circumstances?\n\n11                               MS.

So the statute itself says\n\n13        just a significant number of people.                                                               So query whether the\n\n14        statute itself might in that situation trigger the obligation\n\n15        because 20 might be considered a significant number.                                                                                          Under\n\n16        the regulation, the agency would -- I believe the agency would\n\n17        require -- would supply notice to Virginia, but not to\n\n18        Maryland and DC.\n\n19                 But Your Honor, I should add that in this case the\n\n20        agencies proceeded with RIFs that were not so limited in\n\n21        geographic scope.                              They were RIFs that were nationwide of\n\n22        hundreds and thousands of people across multiple\n\n23        jurisdictions.                         So there was not -- because the agencies\n\n24        didn't go through the process of attempting to comply with the\n\n25        RIF procedures, they didn't themselves define a competitive\n\n\n\n\n             Nadine M.

In this case\n\n12        there was no attempt to define competitive area in some narrow\n\n13        fashion and instead, you see agencies like the treasury\n\n14        department firing several thousand people at once across the\n\n15        country.\n\n16                               THE COURT:                      Well, one of the problems that the Court\n\n17        faces in all of this is if it concludes that, in fact, these\n\n18        were RIFs, then it's really impaired by the fact that the\n\n19        Government didn't take the steps that the law requires,\n\n20        including defining competitive areas first before they acted.\n\n21                               MS.

Well, once the Court\n\n25        finds that it was a RIF, then the Government is in a jam.\n\n\n\n\n             Nadine M. Bachmann, RMR, CRR - Federal Official Court Reporter - 101 W.

And help me to understand how I would\n\n17        craft an order, craft an injunction that got the 20 parties\n\n18        the relief that they're entitled to under my theory, but then\n\n19        didn't extend in this sweeping way across the country without\n\n20        attention to the fact that 31 states presumably looked at this\n\n21        issue and decided not to join the case.

And it is so that the state\n\n 2        can carry out rapid response activities under \u00a7 134(a)(2)(A)\n\n 3        of the Workforce Investment Act.                                                        So the dispute really would\n\n 4        center on whether the state has Workforce Investment Act\n\n 5        obligations.                      And that's distinct from the other things that a\n\n 6        state law might obligate the state to do in connection with an\n\n 7        employee becoming unemployed.\n\n 8                 And it should be enough for the states to know whether\n\n 9        they do or do not have these rapid response requirements.                                                                                                  The\n\n10        reinstating of employees is a separate issue that as Your\n\n11        Honor knows from our briefing it's our position that there's\n\n12        an entirely different way for those issues to be litigated\n\n13        through the Merit Service[sic] Protection --\n\n14                               THE COURT:                      Absolutely.                        But if I don't stop\n\n15        Virginia, if I don't stop you from doing what I say\n\n16        hypothetically are illegal RIFs in Virginia, and there are\n\n17        many Maryland residents who work at federal offices in\n\n18        Virginia.                 So you go ahead and terminate them and they are\n\n19        then as I've said in my opinion, cast upon the state of\n\n20        Maryland, one of the parties in this case as a burden, they\n\n21        now have a responsibility to them that the Federal Government,\n\n22        Congress, imposed on them.\n\n23                 So don't I have to come up with something that says\n\n24        listen, Federal Government, to protect the interests of\n\n25        Maryland and DC which I find are protectable in this\n\n\n\n\n             Nadine M.

What that act does is it creates this\n\n 5        program that obligates states to participate in providing\n\n 6        rapid response activities which I think are --\n\n 7                               THE COURT:                      But that's only triggered by virtue of\n\n 8        the fact that the people got terminated.                                                                      I mean, the state\n\n 9        doesn't have to do anything if the people haven't lost their\n\n10        jobs in significant numbers and come sweeping into the state\n\n11        agencies with a need for help.\n\n12                               MR. HAMILTON:                           So as far from what I understand the\n\n13        rapid response program is where states send individuals to\n\n14        provide information to persons who have been separated as part\n\n15        of large layoffs.                              This is something that happens both with\n\n16        private and public sector mass layoffs and that is distinct\n\n17        from whether employees are being reinstated to whatever\n\n18        employment they had before the mass layoff in question.\n\n19                               THE COURT:                      Well, the whole mission is to serve the\n\n20        suddenly unemployed who exist in sufficient numbers.\n\n21                               MR. HAMILTON:                           Yes, but I think the distinction is\n\n22        that whatever injury the states can complain about should be\n\n23        addressed by saying that the states can't be held liable by\n\n24        the Federal Government for not complying with the Workforce\n\n25        Investment Act.

I might not be correct about that.                                                                But anyways, there's\n\n 5        a federal program that the states work under and it seems like\n\n 6        a lot of this could have been sorted out through communication\n\n 7        between the agency and the states.\n\n 8                 But an additional point that Your Honor noted earlier in\n\n 9        the hearing is the fact that not all reductions in force under\n\n10        the reduction in force statute require notice to states.                                                                                                   It's\n\n11        only those that the statute says is a significant number and\n\n12        then the OPM regulations add to that that it would be where\n\n13        there are 50 people or more in a competitive area.\n\n14                               THE COURT:                      Yeah, but in a competitive area, not in\n\n15        a state.               That's another thing -- that creates a real problem\n\n16        for the Court because they're not congruent.\n\n17                               MR. HAMILTON:                           Right.                And competitive area is\n\n18        defined under 351.402 and it can be quite small.                                                                                   That\n\n19        regulation says exactly what the minimum competitive area must\n\n20        be.      The minimum competitive area is one, a subdivision of the\n\n21        agency; two, under separate administration; three, within the\n\n22        local commuting area.                                     And it's only when that competitive\n\n23        area exceeds 50 employees --\n\n24                               THE COURT:                      But that's easily imagined in\n\n25        DC/Maryland/Virginia.\n\n\n\n\n             Nadine M.

The 18 agencies\n\n 2        that had to comply with the Temporary Restraining Order, the\n\n 3        declarations that we've submitted show a variety in what\n\n 4        happened with probationary employees.

And we submitted\n\n11        information for compliance, not separate fact issues.                                                                                            But I\n\n12        don't know the extent to -- if those were measured on a,\n\n13        again, subdivision of an agency under separate administration\n\n14        within those subdivisions, then broken out by commuting areas,\n\n15        I don't know the extent to which the competitive area would\n\n16        have been triggered.                                   And the record --\n\n17                               THE COURT:                      Well, I think the Court unfortunately\n\n18        has to do some reasonable projection from the evidence that we\n\n19        do have, recognizing that we're at a very preliminary stage of\n\n20        the litigation, but I've still got to make a fundamental\n\n21        decision about whether relief is appropriate or not.

The IRS comes to mind.\n\n24                 So I'm still stuck with the problem of action that the\n\n25        Federal Government takes in a nonparty state that spills back\n\n\n\n\n             Nadine M.

And if I'm determined to protect the\n\n 2        party state from that impact because I find that it otherwise\n\n 3        meets the criteria that I have identified, I'm struggling with\n\n 4        how I would design the injunction to forbid the Government\n\n 5        from doing that in Virginia, an example you and I have been\n\n 6        using, without sweeping more broadly than I need to do that.\n\n 7        And, of course, it's when these national injunctions -- I'm of\n\n 8        the view that sometimes a national injunction is entirely\n\n 9        appropriate and there are circumstances when that's crystal\n\n10        clear.           This isn't such a situation.                                                      This is murky.                             And the\n\n11        Court unfortunately has the responsibility to kind of wade\n\n12        into the swamp here and figure out if it can't draft something\n\n13        more restrictive that is not just easily sweeping across the\n\n14        country.\n\n15                 That's a simple solution and easy to write, but as I\n\n16        discussed with your opponent, profound implications.                                                                                          This is\n\n17        a single district court in one district and I'm very sensitive\n\n18        to the issue that judges should not step beyond the authority\n\n19        that they have been explicitly granted.\n\n20                 At the same time, judges have a responsibility to remedy\n\n21        the harms that are properly before them and to not shrink from\n\n22        doing that when the evidence, law and circumstances otherwise\n\n23        make it clear that that's appropriate.

And the interest of\n\n12        these 20 parties we start with the statute, 3502 and the\n\n13        notice provision in that statute which says that states are\n\n14        entitled to this notice when there's a reduction in force and\n\n15        it is specific in saying what the purpose is of the notice.\n\n16        It is to carry out the rapid response activities under \u00a7 134\n\n17        of the Workforce Investment Act.\n\n18                               THE COURT:                      Yeah, but the problem is that the states\n\n19        are -- these 20 states are unquestionably impacted by\n\n20        terminations that occur in nonparty states.

I'm\n\n 4        much more concerned about the impact on the capacity of states\n\n 5        to bring immediate services to the benefit of people who are\n\n 6        suddenly and unexpectedly unemployed.                                                                And that, to me, is\n\n 7        with crystal clarity what the congressional intent and purpose\n\n 8        was.        And accordingly, those are the Court's marching orders.\n\n 9        I've got to be faithful to that law.\n\n10                               MR.

The only thing I\n\n11        would add is that we read that statute to specify those state\n\n12        issues as the Workforce Investment Act, not the other things\n\n13        that state law might obligate a state to do when someone\n\n14        becomes unemployed, whether that be as part of a mass layoff\n\n15        or not like enrolling someone in unemployment insurance.\n\n16                               THE COURT:                      You have a very cabin confined view of\n\n17        the purpose of the notice.\n\n18                               MR. HAMILTON:                           We think it's the best reading of the\n\n19        statute and of the regulations.                                                      And again, I would make the\n\n20        point that it isn't all reductions in force under the statute\n\n21        that require notice to the states.                                                           It's only under these\n\n22        certain circumstances and the regulations give agencies\n\n23        decision-making authority in crafting that competitive area\n\n24        which would then determine whether or not a state is even\n\n25        entitled to notice in the first place.

We think the plaintiffs lack\n\n21        standing here, all 19 states, as well as the District of\n\n22        Columbia.                 The plaintiffs are focusing on this informational\n\n23        injury, but their theory of standing in connection with that\n\n24        is quite unusual because they aren't seeking the information\n\n25        from the Federal Government; they're, of course, seeking the\n\n\n\n\n             Nadine M.

We read that as\n\n10        really a sequencing sentence that is saying that when the\n\n11        statutory RIF section is implicated, the notice needs to\n\n12        precede the termination of employees.                                                                But there isn't\n\n13        anything in 3502 that says that the statutory RIF procedure is\n\n14        mandatory whenever something might colloquially be called a\n\n15        reduction in force.                                  Instead, that statute begins by telling\n\n16        OPM that it needs to promulgate regulations that give agencies\n\n17        this pathway and this forum to go through prioritizing\n\n18        different employees through this process for carrying out a\n\n19        reduction in force.\n\n20                 And on the merits, our notice argument which is of course\n\n21        part of also our scope of relief argument, but the states of\n\n22        course are -- their claims ride on the premise that they were\n\n23        entitled to receive notice for each of the 21 agency\n\n24        defendants' reductions in force and they haven't carried their\n\n25        burden of showing that as so.

There is the notice requirement as part of 3502 and\n\n22        that has this tie into the Workforce Investment Act, but I\n\n23        don't read that as an overarching purpose of \u00a7 3502 of Title\n\n24        V.\n\n25                   On the balance of the equities and public interest\n\n\n\n\n               Nadine M.

Just two quick\n\n10        points.             First, Your Honor, my friend on the other side\n\n11        suggests that the states should have taken a different\n\n12        approach instead of seeking relief and the Court should have\n\n13        notified the agencies themselves of the issue.                                                                                But, of\n\n14        course, we know that 3502 places the burden on the Federal\n\n15        Government, the agencies, to notify in advance of the action.\n\n16                 So here the states seek relief because of the agency's\n\n17        failure to follow that statute.                                                      It wasn't -- there isn't a\n\n18        provision or a mechanism for the states to relieve themselves\n\n19        of their rapid response duties through some sort of\n\n20        communication with the Government.\n\n21                 The second point I'd like, Your Honor, is on the issue of\n\n22        remedy and particularly as it relates to my friend's standing\n\n23        argument, as Your Honor recognized, the notice here is no\n\n24        longer needed, but the question is how to remedy the plaintiff\n\n25        states' harm as a result of the defendant agency's failure to\n\n\n\n\n             Nadine M.

I\n\n10        did come in here with a laundry list of things that I wanted\n\n11        to cover and then as happens in hearings, we've jumped around\n\n12        a bit.\n\n13                 Reinstatement as a remedy.                                                  Let me hear first from the\n\n14        Government on why reinstatement specifically is precluded\n\n15        because as I think you argue, it's not in the list of\n\n16        traditional equitable remedies that are authorized.

That's\n\n19        exactly right.                         We don't think that reinstatement is a remedy\n\n20        that federal courts are able to provide.                                                                      And that just really\n\n21        goes back to history and it being a remedy that there isn't\n\n22        much precedent for federal courts ordering federal agencies to\n\n23        reinstate federal employees to their work.

Instead, Congress decided\n\n 4        that some of those issues would be able to be litigated before\n\n 5        the Merit Services[sic] Protection Board.\n\n 6                               THE COURT:                      So your point is channeling is all that\n\n 7        is authorized.                         That because of channeling, the pathway to the\n\n 8        agency is all that is authorized.\n\n 9                               MR. HAMILTON:                           I think it's a little more than our\n\n10        channeling argument.                                   I think we just look at history and we\n\n11        don't really see precedent for this.                                                               And the fact that there\n\n12        is an additional statute that actually anticipates this\n\n13        question sort of adds an exclamation mark on that.\n\n14                               THE COURT:                      So what is the remedy?                                           Assume that\n\n15        despite your best arguments and compelling briefs and\n\n16        spectacular performance here in oral argument you lose on the\n\n17        merits.             Then what remedy, what's the remedy?\n\n18                               MR. HAMILTON:                           Well, plaintiffs at most could I\n\n19        think seek some sort of declaratory judgment about their\n\n20        obligations under the Workforce Investment Act, but, I mean,\n\n21        that is so distinct from what they're seeking here when trying\n\n22        to reinstate 24,000 probationers to Federal Government\n\n23        service.\n\n24                               THE COURT:                      Well, how else do you get the pressure\n\n25        off of the states, the pressure that at least in the TRO phase\n\n\n\n\n             Nadine M.

HAMILTON:                           For better or worse, Congress created\n\n 5        a system under which there isn't a way for states to get\n\n 6        relieved of their administrative burden --\n\n 7                               THE COURT:                      So there's no remedy?\n\n 8                               MR. HAMILTON:                           There is no remedy for -- depending\n\n 9        on the injury we're talking about.                                                           I mean, I question whether\n\n10        the Workforce Investment Act would even give the declaratory\n\n11        judgment possibility, but that really is what this --\n\n12                               THE COURT:                      For decades, if not centuries, trial\n\n13        Courts have been told by their appellate superiors if there's\n\n14        a right, presumably there's a remedy.                                                                And it's the district\n\n15        court's job to find it.                                         It's not enough to just say well,\n\n16        they carved out a right here but, you know, there's no obvious\n\n17        remedy.             Done, leave them, marooned.                                                    That is not our law.                                    As\n\n18        a general principle, it's not.\n\n19                 Now, you know, there can be circumstances where immunity,\n\n20        justiciability, this Court was involved heavily in\n\n21        gerrymandering litigation for years.                                                               Ultimately the Supreme\n\n22        Court decided that whatever the evils of gerrymandering might\n\n23        or might not be is just can't be fixed by courts.                                                                                     I\n\n24        understand that.                             But there certainly is an absolute duty and\n\n25        effort to try to find a remedy before coming to that throw up\n\n\n\n\n             Nadine M.

HAMILTON:                           That's what I was attempting to\n\n10        address with my suggestion that at most, the states would be\n\n11        able to seek some sort of declaratory judgment about their\n\n12        obligations under the Workforce Investment Act which is the\n\n13        statute that this notice statute is expressly referencing.\n\n14                               THE COURT:                      So they get a DJ that basically says\n\n15        well, because the Federal Government didn't do what they're\n\n16        supposed to do, the states are relieved of their statutory\n\n17        responsibilities otherwise imposed on them by Congress.\n\n18                               MR. HAMILTON:                           I'd probably frame it more as they\n\n19        didn't have an obligation to do rapid response in the first\n\n20        place.\n\n21                               THE COURT:                      And then the whole purpose that caused\n\n22        Congress to act in the first place which was to protect the\n\n23        states and make sure that they can take care of their citizens\n\n24        is just sort of out the window.                                                      The Feds didn't do what they\n\n25        were supposed to do and the Court then gives the state\n\n\n\n\n             Nadine M. Bachmann, RMR, CRR - Federal Official Court Reporter - 101 W.

Respectfully, Plaintiff States maintain that on the facts of this case, a uniform, nationwide\n\npreliminary injunction remains \u201cnecessary to provide complete relief\u201d to Plaintiffs and is \u201cno more\n\nburdensome\u201d than required to ensure they are not irreparably harmed during the course of this\n\nlitigation. Madsen v. Women\u2019s Health Ctr., Inc., 512 U.S. 753, 765 (1994) (quoting Califano v.\n\nYamasaki, 442 U.S. 682, 702 (1979)). In particular, the Defendants have announced their\n\nintentions to conduct additional reductions in force (\u201cRIFs\u201d) during the course of this litigation. If\n\nthe Court only reinstates probationary employees in the Plaintiff States, employees in the Plaintiff\n\nStates will face a greater likelihood of being subject to the upcoming RIFs than they would if all\n\nprobationary employees were reinstated. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(a) (establishing various retention\n\npreferences); 5 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 351.501-351.504 (explaining the order in which groups of employees\n\nare released, with probationary employees being released before permanent employees). This will\n\nimpose additional burdens on the Plaintiff States\u2014such as additional rapid response burdens\u2014\n\n\n                                                    1\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 116         Filed 03/27/25      Page 2 of 7\n\n\n\nthat they should not have to endure as a result of the Defendants\u2019 unlawful actions. See generally\n\nECF No. 102 at 3-4.\n\n       That said, in the event that this Court disagrees, at a minimum the Court must stay or enjoin\n\nDefendants\u2019 unlawful RIFs as applied to federal probationary employees with duty stations or\n\nresidence in each Plaintiff State. That is because the Plaintiff States would have to expend\n\nresources in either situation that could have been mitigated with proper notice.\n\n       To give a concrete example, an employee who resides in Virginia (a non-Plaintiff State)\n\nbut works in Maryland would generally have to file their unemployment claim in Maryland, their\n\nstate of employment. That is so because generally an unemployment insurance claim \u201cshall be\n\nassigned to the State in which [a terminated employee] had his last official station in Federal\n\nservice before the filing of his first claim for compensation for the benefit year.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8504.\n\nAs this has been unfolding on the ground, Plaintiff States have seen tangible increases in the\n\nnumber of unemployment claims by federal employees compared to the same period last year.\n\nSee, e.g., MD DOL Decl. ECF No. 4-5 \u00b6\u00b6 18, 50, 52 (30-60 claims per day, equating to a 330%\n\nincrease); NJ DOL Decl. ECF No. 4-11 \u00b6\u00b6 14-15 (273% increase); CA EDD Decl. ECF No. 4-7\n\n\u00b6 30 (149% increase).\n\n       But an employee who resides in Maryland and works in Virginia would generally seek any\n\nother social services aimed at mitigating the harms of unemployment from Maryland, their state\n\nof residence. See, e.g., COMAR 10.09.24.05-3A (\u201cTo be eligible for the Maryland Medical\n\nAssistance Program, an applicant or recipient shall be a Maryland resident.\u201d); COMAR\n\n07.03.17.08A(2) (requiring applicants for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (\u201cSNAP\u201d)\n\nto \u201creside[] in the political subdivision served by the local department where the household is\n\napplying\u201d).\n\n\n\n\n                                                 2\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 116        Filed 03/27/25     Page 3 of 7\n\n\n\n       As a result, a terminated federal worker who lives in one jurisdiction and works in another\n\nwould file for different services in different jurisdictions. Cf., e.g., Redacted Declaration, ECF\n\nNo. 33-6 (Ex. R) \u00b6\u00b6 7, 9 (Maryland resident, who pays income tax to Maryland, setting out plans\n\nto apply for unemployment insurance benefits with the D.C. government and considering applying\n\nto Medicaid and SNAP); Redacted Declaration, ECF No. 33-8 (Ex. T) \u00b6\u00b6 7, 10 (similar). The same\n\nis true of many part-time remote federal workers whose official worksite may be the office\n\nlocation, not their home location. See 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 531.605(d)(1) (the agency office is the official\n\nworksite of a typically remote employee who is scheduled to work in office at least two days per\n\nbiweekly pay period). If one of these workers is terminated, he would apply for unemployment\n\ninsurance benefits in the state where his agency office is located, but would apply for Medicaid,\n\nSNAP, and other resources in his home jurisdiction.\n\n       Whether a terminated employee works or resides in a Plaintiff State, notice could have\n\nmitigated these burdens. The need for a stay or injunction as applied to terminated employees with\n\nduty stations in Plaintiff States is obvious. Plaintiff States should have received notice of these\n\nseparations within their borders, which would have triggered their rapid response efforts and\n\nreduced the need for unemployment assistance, among other things. For similar reasons, a stay or\n\ninjunction is also appropriate as to terminated employees who work in non-Plaintiff States but\n\nreside in Plaintiff States. Ultimately, had Defendants followed the law and provided all States\n\nwith notice prior to conducting their RIFs, it would have triggered federally mandated rapid\n\nresponses in any state where the threshold number of terminations was met. See 29 U.S.C.\n\n\u00a7 2864(a)(2)(A)(i)(II); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 682.302, 682.305.

JKB-25-0748\n\nUNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF a\nAGRICULTURE, et al.,\n\nDefendants.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nMEMORANDUM AND ORDER\n\nPending before the Court is Plaintiff States\u2019 Motion to Extend Temporary Restraining\nOrder. (ECF No. 85.) The Court entered a Temporary Restraining Order (\u201cTRO\u201d) in this case on\nMarch 13, 2025, which had been set to expire on Thursday, March 27, 2025, at 8:00 p.m. EDT.\n(ECF No. 44.) As described below, the Court concludes that there is good cause to extend the\nTRO for a brief period. The TRO will be extended to Tuesday, April 1, 2025, at 8:00 p.m. EDT.\n\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(b)(2) provides that a TRO \u201cexpires at the time after\nentry\u2014not to exceed 14 days\u2014that the court sets, unless before that time the court, for good cause,\nextends it for a like period or the adverse party consents to a longer extension. The reasons for an\n\nextension must be entered in the record.\u201d\n\nAlthough there is little case law on what constitutes \u201cgood cause,\u201d \u201ca showing that\nthe grounds for originally granting the [TRO] continue to exist\u201d is sufficient,\nWright & Miller, 11A Fed. Prac. & Proc. Civ. \u00a7 2953 (3d ed. Apr. 2020 Update),\nand courts have also found \u201cgood cause\u201d where more time is needed fully to\nconsider the parties\u2019 arguments and motions or \u201cwhere the moving party need[s]\nadditional time to prepare and present its preliminary injunction,\u201d SEC vy.\nArisebank, Civ. No. 18-186, 2018 WL 10419828 at *1 (N.D. Tex. Mar. 9, 2018)\n\n(collecting cases).\n\nCosta y. Bazron, Civ. No. RDM-19-3185, 2020 WL 2410502, at *2 (D.D.C. May 11, 2020).\n\fThe Court concludes that there is good cause for a brief, five-day extension of the TRO.\nOn March 20, 2025, Plaintiff States filed a Motion for a Section 705 Stay and Preliminary\nInjunction (\u201cPreliminary Injunction Motion\u201d). (ECF No. 78.) The Government filed its Response\nin Opposition on March 24, 2025. (ECF No. 101.) The Court held a Hearing on the Preliminary\nInjunction Motion today, March 26, 2025. During the Hearing, it became apparent that there were\nimportant issues that had not been fully addressed in the parties\u2019 briefs, and accordingly the Court\nordered\u2014and the parties agreed to submit\u2014additional briefing, due tomorrow, March 27, 2025.\nThe Court appreciate the parties\u2019 speed in submitting these and prior presentations, and the Court\nis working diligently to resolve this matter as expeditiously as possible. That said, given the\ncomplex issues presented by this case and the condensed timing of argument and briefing, the\nCourt requires time to fully consider the parties\u2019 positions and to prepare its memorandum and\naccompanying order. It is the Court\u2019s expectation that it will issue its ruling on the Preliminary\nInjunction Motion within this five-day time period.\n\nAccordingly, it is ORDERED that:\n\n1. Plaintiff States\u2019 Motion to Extend Temporary Restraining Order (ECF No. 85) is\n\nGRANTED.\n2. For good cause found, the TRO (ECF No. 44) is EXTENDED for five additional days,\n\nand SHALL EXPIRE on Tuesday, April 1, 2025, at 8:00 p.m. EDT.\n\nDATED this 2\u00a9 day of March, 2025.\n\nBY THE COURT:\n\nLD wer (2dr\n\nJames K.

I am the Acting Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Administration within\nDepartmental Administration at the United States Department of Agriculture (\u201cUSDA\u201d or\nDepartment\u2019) headquartered in Washington, D.C. I make this Declaration based on my own\npersonal knowledge, on information contained in the records of USDA, or on information provided\nto me by USDA employees. | have served in this position since January 31, 2025, and I have been\nemployed at USDA since 2018. I submitted a previous declaration in this matter on March 17,\n2025, and rely on and incorporate my prior declaration testimony in making this declaration.\n\n2. In my role at USDA, I currently oversee the Department\u2019s Office of Human\nResources Management and | have purview over USDA subagencies\u2019 Chief Operating Officers\nand Human Resources Offices.\n\n3. As of Monday, March 17, 2025, USDA had approximately 5,714 Affected\n\nProbationary Employees, as defined in paragraph 10(c) of the Temporary Restraining Order. As\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document 103-1 Filed 03/25/25 Page 3of 55\n\nof that date, USDA had reinstated all 5,714 Affected Probationary Employees. On March 12, 2025,\nUSDA reinstated all 5,714 Affected Probationary Employees by restoring them to the status they\nwere in prior to their terminations and provided each with back pay from the date of their respective\ntermination. As part of a phased plan for return-to-duty, upon returning to pay status, the Affected\nProbationary Employees were initially placed on paid administrative leave.\n\n4, A group of 1,070 seasonal Forest Service Affected Probationary Employees who\nwere not in pay status at the time of their terminations (due to the off-season) have been reinstated\nto their prior unpaid status. These employees will return to pay status on a rolling basis during the\nmonths of April and May. Additionally, there are six Affected Probationary Employees in the\nForeign Agricultural Service who were administratively furloughed prior to their terminations, and\nwho have been reinstated to their prior administrative furlough status.\n\n5. On Friday, March 14, 2025, USDA began the process of notifying all Affected\nProbationary Employees that they have been reinstated. All Affected Probationary Employees\nhave been notified of their reinstatement: (1) via an initial notification from USDA to each\nemployee, pursuant to a March 5, 2025 Stay Order issued by the Merit Systems Protection Board\n(\u201cMSPB\u201d); (2) via a separate, subsequent notification from USDA to each employee, pursuant to\nthe March 13, 2025 preliminary injunction issued in the case of AFGE, et al., v. OPM, et al., with\nsaid notification referring employees to a USDA press release website for updates; and (3) via the\naforementioned USDA press release titled \u201cUSDA Status Update on Probationary Employees\u201d\nthat was published on March 11, 2025, and subsequently updated on March 19, 2025. The update\n\ncan be found at https://www.usda.gov/about-usda/news/press-releases/2025/03/1 1/usda-status-\n\nupdate-probationary-employees.\n\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document 103-1 Filed 03/25/25 Page 4of55\n\n6. Now that USDA has reinstated and notified the Affected Probationary Employees\nto the pay status they were in prior to their terminations, the Affected Probationary Employees\nwho are in pay status are currently on administrative leave. USDA placed the Affected\nProbationary Employees on administrative leave temporarily, as an initial step as part of the phased\nplan to return the employees to work.\n\n7. USDA has developed a phased plan to return the Affected Probationary Employees\nto work that considers an employee\u2019s need to access and availability of information technology\nand other equipment; Lincpasses (badges); systems credentials; workstation readiness; and safety\nand security of facilities. USDA has four phases: Phase |: Return to Duty March 24, 2025; Phase\n2: Return to Duty March 31, 2025; Phase 3: Return to Duty April 7, 2025; Phase 4: U.S. Forest\nService permanent seasonal employees that are currently in non-pay status with a reporting date\nlater than April 7, 2025. In Phase 1, USDA plans to return 1,806 employees. In Phase 2, USDA\nplans to return 676 employees. In Phase 3, USDA plans to return 2,407 employees. In Phase 4,\n\nUSDA plans to return 825 employees.\n\nPursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true\n\nand correct.\n\nDated: March 25, 2025\nDigitally signed by MARY\n\nRICE\nMARY RIC Date: 2025.03.25 11:45:13\n\n-04'00'\nMARY PLETCHER RICE\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document 103-1 Filed 03/25/25 Page5of55\n\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF MARYLAND\n\nMaryland, et al.,\n\n. Case No. 1:25-cv-00748-JKB\nPlaintiffs,\n\nV.\n\nUnited States Department of Agriculture,\n\net al.,\nDefendants.\nDECLARATION OF JESSICA S. PALATKA\nPursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I, Jessica S. Palatka declare as follows:\n1. I am the Chief Human Capital Officer for the Department of Commerce\n(Commerce) headquartered in Washington, D.C. I make this declaration based on my own\n\npersonal knowledge, on information contained in the records of Commerce, or on information\nprovided to me by Commerce employees.\n\n2. I have served in this position since September 2021. In my role at Commerce, I am\nresponsible for personnel management. | have the responsibility for overseeing the personnel\nenterprise and tracking and recording of personnel actions, including terminations. I assist in\nensuring that all personnel actions comply with federal law, including those related to probationary\nemployees. I submitted a previous declaration in this matter on March 17, 2025, and rely on and\nincorporate my prior declaration testimony in making this declaration.\n\n3. In my previous declaration dated March 17, 2025, I stated that, between January\n\n20, 2025, and March 3, 2025, Commerce terminated 791 probationary employees out of\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document 103-1 Filed 03/25/25 Page 6of55\n\napproximately 9,000 probationary and trial period employees. I have subsequently learned that\nthe correct total number of probationary employees terminated during that time period is 790. The\nhigher figure erroneously included a probationary employee who had submitted a resignation prior\nto the termination action; Commerce has corrected that employee\u2019s records.\n\n4, My previous declaration also stated that, because 27 probationary employees had\nbeen reinstated within days of their terminations for various operational reasons, as of March 17,\n2025, Commerce had 764 Affected Probationary Employees, as defined in paragraph 10(c) of the\nTemporary Restraining Order. As noted above, one probationary employee had submitted a\nresignation prior to the termination action and should not have been included in the total number\nof Affected Probationary Employees. I have also subsequently learned that another probationary\nemployee had been terminated for conduct and received a different termination letter, and thus\nshould not have been included in the total number of Affected Probationary Employees.\nAccordingly, the correct number of Commerce\u2019s Affected Probationary Employees, as of Monday,\nMarch 17, 2025, is 762.\n\n5.

I submitted a previous declaration in this matter on March 17, 2025, and rely on and\n\nincorporate my prior declaration testimony in making this declaration.\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document 103-1 Filed 03/25/25 Page 27 of 55\n\n3. As of Monday, March 17, 2025, Treasury had 7,611 Affected Probationary\nEmployees, as defined in paragraph 10(c) of the Temporary Restraining Order. As of that date,\nTreasury had reinstated 7,560 Affected Probationary Employees.\n\n4, Between March 17 and March 20, Treasury notified all Affected Probationary\nEmployees of their reinstatement, either by email or letter.\n\n5. Fifty-one Affected Probationary Employees declined reinstatement or requested to\nresign.\n\n6. All Affected Probationary Employees have had their Removal Personnel Action\nRequests cancelled and have been placed in a paid Administrative Leave status. As is the agency\u2019s\nregular practice, employees in an Administrative Leave status continue to have their access to\nTreasury duty locations, computer networks, and email suspended pending their return to regular\nduty status.\n\n7. Treasury\u2019s three operating personnel offices are at different stages of documenting\ncancellation of termination actions; the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency never processed\ntermination actions for their 72 Affected Probationary Employees and so will not generate any SF-\n50s; the IRS manually processed cancellation actions and generated cancellation SF-SOs for all\n7,315 of its Affected Probationary Employees with a remark stating \u201cReinstatement of\nProbationary Employee.\u201d Treasury\u2019s Administrative Resource Center has processed cancellation\nactions for the 225 Affected Probationary Employees from its customer organizations (Bureau of\nEngraving and Printing, Bureau of the Fiscal Service and the U.S. Mint) but the resulting SF-50s\nhave not yet been generated. They anticipate the cancellation SF-50s being generated by April 3.\n\n8. Affected Probationary Employees who have been reinstated and who have had or\n\ncontinue to have other employment have been instructed to coordinate with their bureau\u2019s Ethics\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document 103-1 Filed 03/25/25 Page 28 of 55\n\nOffice to discuss outside employment restrictions and to seek supervisory approval for outside\nemployment under appropriate circumstances.\n\n9. Regarding the next steps toward processing employees into the next stage of\nreinstatement to full duty status, the Treasury Department has not issued prescriptive guidance, as\ncircumstances vary considerably between and within its bureaus. Logistics concerns, such as the\navailability of office space and equipment, and the time required for reissuance of identity\ncredentials, are non-uniform across the Department. In addition, the Department is finalizing plans\nin response to President Trump\u2019s February | 1, 2025 Executive Order /mplementing the President's\n\u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency\u201d Workforce Optimization Initiative. These plans will be\ntailored for each bureau, and in many cases will require separations of substantial numbers of\nemployees through reductions in force (RIFs). Because RIFs are seniority-based, a RIF in any\nparticular competitive area will disproportionately affect reinstated probationary employees. In\nsome case, bureaus may determine that the likelihood of certain reinstated probationary employees\nbeing separated is sufficiently high that restoring them to full duties in advance of the planned RIF\nwould be unduly disruptive to both the employees and the bureau.\n\nPursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, 1 declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true\n\nand correct.\n\nDated: March 25, 2025\n\nTREVOR NORRIS\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document 103-1 Filed 03/25/25 Page 29 of 55\n\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF MARYLAND\n\nMaryland, et al., |\n\ni.

As of Monday, March 17, 2025, VA had 1,683 Affected Probationary Employees,\nas defined in paragraph 10(c) of the Temporary Restraining Order. As of that date, VA had\nreinstated all Affected Probationary Employees to a pay status.\n\n4, By March 21, 2025, VA identified approximately 10 additional Affected\nProbationary Employees and reinstated them to a pay status. If VA identifies any additional\nAffected Probationary Employees, it will expeditiously reinstate them to a pay status effective\nMarch 17, 2025.\n\n5. By or between March 17 and March 21, 2025, VA communicated Affected\nProbationary Employees\u2019 reinstatement status to each by telephone, personal email, regular mail,\nand/or other means of communication. VA is continuing this notification process to reach all\nAffected Probationary Employees.\n\n6. VA has taken the following steps to process all reinstatements: cancelling all SF-\n50s reflecting termination and placed all identified Affected Probationary Employees in an initial\npaid status using administrative leave. VA re-enabled the user accounts of the Affected\nProbationary Employees in its system and applied temporary exemptions to the requirement for a\nPersonal Identity Verification (PIV) card.\n\n7.

I make this declaration based\non my own personal knowledge, on information contained in the records of the CFPB, or on\ninformation provided to me by CFPB employees.\n\n2. [ have served in this position since approximately, Monday, October 21, 2024. In\nmy role at the CFPB, | am responsible for personnel management. I have the responsibility for\noverseeing the personnel enterprise and tracking and recording of personnel actions, including\nterminations. | assist in ensuring that all personnel actions comply with federal law, including those\nrelated to probationary employees. I submitted a previous declaration in this matter on March 17,\n\n2025, and rely on and incorporate my prior declaration testimony in making this declaration.\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document 103-1 Filed 03/25/25 Page 33 of 55\n\n3. As of Monday, March 17, 2025, CFPB had 117 Affected Probationary Employees,\nas defined in paragraph 10(c) of the Temporary Restraining Order. As of that date, CFPB had\nreinstated 117 Affected Probationary Employees.\n\n4, On Sunday, March 16, 2025, CFPB transmitted reinstatement notices to 117\nemployees via personal email. 96 employees have acknowledged receipt of the reinstatement\nnotice. CFPB will continue to attempt contact with the 21 employees who have not acknowledged\nreceipt by resending the reinstatement notices to personal email addresses and contacting\nemployees via personal phone numbers.\n\n5. Two employees have notified CFPB that they have accepted other employment.\nThese employees will receive back pay through the date they accepted new employment.\n\n6. The Human Capital Staff has coordinated on-boarding efforts with the Bureau\u2019s\nSecurity and Technology and Innovations (T&l) teams. A full list of reinstatement employees was\ndistributed on Monday, March 17, 2025, to begin re-onboarding staff members. T&I is working\nwith each employee to reinstate access to the Bureau\u2019s network, systems, and applications (email,\nTeams, etc.) and has determined if assets need to be re-provisioned (i.e., the individual returned\ntheir equipment, and it must be reissued). Security has already begun the process to reissue/print\nPIV cards for impacted individuals.\n\n7. CFPB is working with its external human resources processing shared service\nprovider and was able to cancel the termination action from the human resources system of records\nand employee personnel files. 113 out of 117 reinstatements have applied in the system. Four\nreinstated employee returned suspense errors and were reapplied in the system. There is no record\nof separation having occurred for these individuals. Consequently, there is not an SF-50 to\n\neffectuate a reinstatement, as there is no longer any record of them being terminated. Once\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document 103-1 Filed 03/25/25 Page 34 of 55\n\nemployees have full access to CFPB systems, they will be able to review their personnel profile in\nour human resources information system and their individual electronic official personnel file\n(eOPF).\n8. The CFPB continues to work with its external human resources processing shared service\nprovider to develop a plan for the transmission of payroll. Pay period 3 (PP03)(February 9 \u2014 22,\n2025) and pay period 4 (PP04)(February 23 \u2014 March 8, 2025) correction timesheets are being\nprocessed and are set for transmission by Monday, March 24, 2025. Employees have been\nreinstated effective pay period 5 (PP05)(March 9 \u2014 22, 2025) and can resume normal timekeeping\nfunctions for the submission of payroll as of that pay period. All payroll dating back to the\nseparation date of the individuals is set to run and pay out with the PPO5 processing. We expect\nall employees will receive their electronic funds transfer (EFT) of back pay, and resumption of\npay by March 31, 2025.\n\n9. All employees have been reinstated under administrative leave providing the CFPB\nan opportunity to code timesheets for back pay and getting equipment and PIV cards reissued.\nOnce employees are fully re-onboarded and have system access, they will be able to resume\n\napproved work activities.\n\nPursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true\n\nand correct.\n\nDated: March 24, 2025\nDigitally signed by\nADAM ADAM MARTINEZ\nDate: 2025.03.24\nMARTINEZ s6.40:45-04'00\n\nAdam Martinez\n\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document 103-1 Filed 03/25/25 Page 35 of 55\n\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF MARYLAND\n\nMaryland, et al.,\n\n, Case No. 1:25-cv-00748-JKB\n-Plaintiffs,\n\nVv.\nUnited States Department of Agriculture,\n\net al.,\n\nDefendants.\n\nDECLARATION OF KRYSTI J.

ET, EPA sent emails to the personal email\naddresses of all the Affected Probationary Employees notifying them that their terminations were\nrescinded, as required by the TRO.\n\n5. As of March 21, 2025, EPA identified two former probationary employees who are\nnot being reinstated because records show they resigned prior to February 14, 2025. Personnel\nactions have been processed to properly reflect those resignations. This leaves approximately 417\nAffected Probationary Employees.\n\n6. EPA uses the Department of Interior\u2019s HR processing system, Federal Personnel\nand Payroll System (\u201cFPPS*). As of March 19, 2025, EPA processed all of the cancellations for\nthe relevant termination actions in FPPS. We are working to remove all the cancelled termination\nactions from the Affected Probationary Employees\u2019 electronic official personnel folders (eOPFs).\nAdditionally, all of the timecards were updated to change the Affected Probationary Employees\u2019\nstatuses and, as noted above, Affected Probationary Employees all received a notice that their\ntermination was rescinded on March 16, 2025.\n\n7. On March 21, 2025, EPA emailed all Affected Probationary Employees to verify\ntheir preferences for their Federal Employee Health Benefits (FEHB) election since they have had\na Qualifying Life Event (QLE) and they are entitled to make a new election for benefits. This\ncommunication gave them the option to reinstate their prior FEHB coverage, select a new FEHB\nplan, or decline coverage.

As of that date,\nUSAID had reinstated 270 Affected Probationary Employees.\n\n4. On Monday, March 17, 2025, USAID communicated Affected Probationary\nEmployees\u2019 reinstatement status to each by personal email. There were approximately 6\nprobationary employees whom we were unable to reach because we did not have their personal\nemails.

GARDNER\n\nPursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I, Johnathan J. Gardner declare as follows:\n\n1. [ am the Acting Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary for Human Capital,\nDepartment of Health and Human Services headquartered in Washington, D.C. I make this\ndeclaration based on my own personal knowledge, on information contained in the records of the\nUnited States Department of Health and Human Services (\u201cHHS\u201d), or on information provided to\nme by the Department\u2019s Human Resources Directors or their designees.\n\n2. I have served in this position since August 12, 2024. In my role at the HHS, I am\nresponsible for personnel management. | have the responsibility for overseeing the personnel\nenterprise and tracking and recording of personnel actions, including terminations. I assist in\nensuring that all personnel actions comply with federal law, including those related to probationary\nemployees. | submitted a previous declaration in this matter on March 17, 2025, and rely on and\nincorporate my prior declaration testimony in making this declaration. However, since March 17,\n\n2025, | learned that not all Affected Probationary Employees received notification by March 17,\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document 103-1 Filed 03/25/25 Page 49 of 55\n\n2025. Since March 17, 2025, HHS took action to ensure all Affected Probationary Employees\nreceived notice and by March 21, 2025, notification was completed.\n\n3. As of Monday, March 17, 2025, HHS had 3,248 Affected Probationary Employees,\nas defined in paragraph 10(c) of the Temporary Restraining Order. As of that date, HHS had\nreinstated 88 Affected Probationary Employees who were terminated before the end of their\nprobationary period, between February 15 and March 13, 2025, and extended the administrative\nleave status of 2,855 probationary and trial period employees who were previously scheduled to\nbe terminated on or after March 14, 2025.\n\n4. By March 17, 2025, the National Institutes of Health (\u201cNIH\u201d) sent email messages\nto all of its 837 Affected Probationary Employees at their personal and NIH email addresses. NIH\nreceived undeliverable messages for 12 of these employees and thereafter, asked the impacted\nInstitute and Center Executive Officers to contact these employees directly. NIH placed the\nAffected Probationary Employees in active status in its personnel system, and all Affected\nProbationary Employees are in a pay status. Employee leave status is being handled internally\nwithin each Institute or Center at NIH, but centralized communication was provided to ensure\nconsistency in approach. NIH was able to cancel all termination actions in its system so it does not\nneed to issue SF-50s for reinstatement. At NIH, 37 Affected Probationary Employees were\nterminated in its system and received lump sum payments for annual leave; all 37 terminations\nwere cancelled. Of those 37, two have elected to resign so NIH will process those resignations;\n25 employees have accepted reinstatement and NIH has submitted tickets to its payroll provider\nto recover the annual leave payout for these employees. Of those 25, 12 have been fully authorized\nto return to work as they were approved through an exceptions process. NIH is still waiting for a\n\nresponse from the remaining 10 employees regarding whether they will accept reinstatement.\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document 103-1 Filed 03/25/25 Page 50 of 55\n\n5. As of 1:00 p.m. on March 17, 2025, the Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d)\nhad notified all 402 Affected Probationary Employees. By Sunday, March 16, 2025, at 1:15 p.m.,\nFDA had sent an email notification, via personal email addresses, to 392 employees. The\nremaining 10 employees were contacted at their personal phone numbers on or before 1:00 p.m.\non Monday, March 17, 2025. As of March 21, 2025, of the 402 Affected Probationary Employees\nat FDA, 5 have requested to resign. Nine have been provided email and security access and are\nworking (3 of the 9 are currently going through the badging reinstatement process). 388 are on\nadministrative leave without IT or physical security access. FDA has submitted tickets to rescind\nthe nine terminations and to process one resignation to HHS\u2019s payroll provider, DFAS. FDA\nanticipates that SF-50s will be generated for these actions this week.\n6. The Health Resources and Services Administration (\u2018HRSA\u201d) notified all 179 of its\nAffected Probationary Employees via personal email by 11:55 a.m. on Monday, March 17, 2025.\nAt present, no employees at HRSA have declined reinstatement. However, HRSA has seven\nemployees who intend to resign from their positions. HRSA extended administrative leave for\n. these employees and is awaiting receipt of formal resignation letters. HRSA is working to restore\nleave that may have been paid out and to reinstate accounts for Affected Probationary Employees\nwho were terminated and subsequently reinstated. HRSA is working to determine whether six\nemployees received termination SF-50s. At this time, the SF-50s are not in employees\u2019 eOPFs so\nHRSA is unsure if employees will receive the termination SF-50s. If the HRSA employee receives\nthe termination SF-50, HRSA will take all necessary actions to cancel and issue an SF-50 that\nshows cancellation of the termination action.\n7. As of March 19, 2025, at 4:35 p.m., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n\n(\u201cCDC\u201d) notified all 457 of its Affected Probationary Employees by email sent to the employee\u2019s\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document 103-1 Filed 03/25/25 Page 51 of 55\n\npersonal email address that they would continue on administrative leave until March 21, 2025. On\nMarch 21, 2025, an updated notice was subsequently emailed to all 457 Affected Probationary\nEmployees that they would continue on administrative leave until further notice. One CDC\nemployee declined to be continued on administrative leave. CDC took all necessary actions to\nextend the Affected Probationary Employees\u2019 administrative leave. Their logical and physical\naccess remains revoked. They remain active in CDC\u2019s payroll and employment systems. CDC\ndoes not have any pending SF-50s.\n\n8. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\u201cCMS\u201d) notified all Affected\nProbationary Employees that their administrative leave would continue by 1:30 p.m., on March\n17, 2025. Notification was provided by phone call with a follow-up email to employees\u2019 personal\nemail addresses if they could not be immediately reached by phone. Out of 289 Affected\nProbationary Employees, CMS offered full reinstatement to duty status to 106 employees. 94\nemployees accepted and 12 of these employees indicated they did not want to return. CMS has\nrestored IT access for these 94 employees. 61 employees have had all access restored and have\nreturned to work. 33 of these employees are currently awaiting badge reissuance and remaining\nsystems access and will remain on administrative leave until they can fully return to work. Of the\nremaining 183 Affected Probationary Employees, 10 have indicated they do not want to return,\nand 173 will continue to be placed on administrative leave. CMS does not have any remaining\nreinstatement SF-50s to complete and has canceled all termination actions. CMS has one Affected\nProbationary Employee who is currently employed by a Federal contractor but is seeking\nreinstatement. CMS is consulting with its Ethics officials to determine next steps.\n\n9. The Administration for Children and Families (\u201cACF\u201d) notified 8 Affected\n\nProbationary Employees that they would be reinstated and placed on administrative leave on\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document 103-1 Filed 03/25/25 Page 52 of 55\n\nMarch 17, 2025. The remaining 152 Affected Probationary Employees were notified of the\nextension of their administrative leave status on March 18, 2025, at approximately 12:20 p.m.\nThese notifications were made by email! to the employees\u2019 personal email addresses and by\ntelephone call. This administrative leave was entered into the ACF time and attendance system on\nMarch 19, 2025.\n\n10.\u2018 For all other Operating Divisions (Administration for Community Living (\u201cACL\u201d),\nAgency for Healthcare and Research Quality (\u201cAHRQ\u201d), Substance Abuse and Mental Health\nAdministration (\u201cSAMHSA\u201d), Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response\n(\u201cASPR\u201d), and Staff Divisions within the Office of the Secretary serviced by the Department\u2019s\nStaffing, Recruitment, and Operations Center (\u201cSROC\u201d), Affected Probationary Employees were\nnotified between March 17, 2025, and March 21, 2025, that they would be reinstated and/or\ncontinued to be placed on administrative leave.

As of Monday, March 17, 2025, DOT had 775 Affected Probationary Employees,\nas defined in paragraph 10(c) of the Temporary Restraining Order. On that date, DOT contacted\nall 775 Affected Probationary Employees by telephone, personal email, and/or other means of\ncommunication, informing them that DOT was rescinding their terminations and reinstating them.\nDOT successfully contacted all 775 Affected Probationary Employees. The 775 Affected\nProbationary Employees were reinstated with pay and benefits to their previous positions with\nDOT and the federal service, and they will receive their regular compensation for the period from\nFebruary 15, 2025, to their reinstatement.\n\n4. In order to effectuate an orderly return to DOT, the Affected Probationary\nEmployes were placed on paid administrative leave for a short period upon their reinstatement and\nwere returned to active duty on March 20, 2025.

See ECF No.\n\n78-1 at 18-20. Enjoining the unlawful RIFs in their entirety, and not just in the Plaintiff States, is\n\nappropriate and necessary for two reasons specific to RIFs and the facts of this particular case. In\n\nparticular, the Plaintiff States have established that the violations were not confined to the Plaintiff\n\nStates, and that failure to enjoin the unlawful RIFs in their entirety will continue to impose harms\n\non the Plaintiff States. See Madsen v. Women\u2019s Health Ctr., Inc., 512 U.S. 753, 765 (1994)\n\n(ensuring that any relief granted should be \u201cno more burdensome to the defendant[s] than\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB         Document 102        Filed 03/24/25      Page 2 of 9\n\n\n\n\nnecessary to provide complete relief to the plaintiffs\u201d (quoting Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U.S.\n\n682, 702 (1979)).\n\n       1. At the outset, the Plaintiff States have established that the government violated the law\n\nnot only in the Plaintiff States, but in non-Plaintiff States as well. Importantly, when an agency\n\nconducts a RIF, it must define the \u201ccompetitive area\u201d within which employees must compete for\n\nretention. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7351.402(a), (b). While an agency may define a competitive area to encompass\n\nonly some organizational units or geographic locations, it can also define a competitive area to\n\nencompass the entire agency, without regard to geographic location. See 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.402(b).\n\nIn unlawfully disregarding the RIF procedures, the Defendant Agencies failed to properly define\n\nthe \u201ccompetitive areas\u201d for the RIFs. That alone is a basis to presume that the \u201ccompetitive area\u201d\n\nfor each agency\u2019s unlawful RIF was the entire agency. And the evidence also confirms that\n\nDefendant Agencies conducted agency-wide RIFs: After receiving an order from OPM to\n\nterminate all probationary employees, Defendants used form letters to terminate probationary\n\nemployees across offices and jurisdictions. See, e.g., ECF 4-37 (IRS HR manager stating that the\n\nChief Human Capital Officer of Treasury instructed her to \u201cidentify all probationary employees at\n\nthe IRS and terminate all of them \u2018based on performance\u2019\u201d using form letters and gave similar\n\norders to other components of Treasury).\n\n       Given that the competitive area for each Defendant\u2019s unlawful RIF was the entire\n\nDefendant Agency, each Defendant Agency should have provided notice to the States and local\n\njurisdictions where any of those separations were to occur. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d)(3)(A)\n\n(requiring notice to states when 50 or more employees will be released from within a \u201ccompetitive\n\narea\u201d); 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.803(b) (same). But Defendant Agencies did not provide notice to any State,\n\n\n\n                                                2\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 102        Filed 03/24/25       Page 3 of 9\n\n\n\n\nnotwithstanding that each Defendant Agency terminated 50 or more probationary employees. See,\n\ne.g., ECF No. 52 (attaching illustrative declarations of the hundreds, and in some cases thousands,\n\nof probationary employees affected at each Defendant Agency). Plaintiff States have therefore\n\nestablished that the violations of the RIF statutes were not confined to the Plaintiff States and\n\ninstead extended to every jurisdiction where probationary employees were terminated. Granting\n\nrelief without regard to where the separations occurred is therefore consistent with the scope of\n\nthe violation established.\n\n       2. Staying the unlawful RIFs in their entirety now\u2014rather than just in the Plaintiff States\u2014\n\nwill ensure that the Plaintiff States are not forced to endure still more harms. Granting only partial\n\nrelief from the unlawful RIFs at this juncture would mean staggered reinstatements, which\n\nthreatens to sow further chaos and confusion and impose additional burdens on the Plaintiff States.\n\nReinstating probationary employees in only some jurisdictions would mean that, in the next round\n\nof RIFs, which Defendants acknowledge are in the works,1 Defendants will separate or retain\n\nemployees who should not otherwise be separated or retained based on ranking criteria such as\n\nveteran\u2019s status or length of service. This will mean that a Plaintiff State may be required to\n\nprovide rapid response services to individuals who are initially separated but later reinstated once\n\nall probationary employees are properly taken into account. The same Plaintiff State would then\n\nneed to provide rapid response services to a different set of individuals who were initially retained\n\nbut ultimately separated, once all probationary employees are properly taken into account. This\n\n\n\n\n1\n       Ex. 1, Memo. from Russel T. Vought, Dir., Off. of Mgmt, & Budget & Charles Ezell,\nActing Dir., OPM, to Heads of Executive Dep\u2019ts & Agencies (Feb. 26, 2025); Ex. 2, U.S.\nDepartment of Education Initiates Reduction in Force (Mar. 11, 2025).\n\n\n                                                  3\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 102         Filed 03/24/25      Page 4 of 9\n\n\n\n\nwill impose additional burdens on Plaintiff States\u2019 rapid response programs. The same holds true\n\nfor the Plaintiff States\u2019 administration of unemployment benefits and social services. Plaintiff\n\nStates will be required to process more claims for benefits and more claims for overpayments,\n\nincreasing administrative burdens and backlogs. In other words, not providing uniform relief will\n\ncontinue to impose harms on the Plaintiff States.\n\n       Accordingly, to avoid any such confusion and harm during this litigation, this Court should\n\ngrant uniform preliminary relief from the unlawful agency-wide RIFs to ensure that it can still\n\nprovide complete relief at the end of the case. See District of Columbia v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of\n\nAgriculture, 444 F. Supp. 3d 1, 49-50 (D.D.C. 2020) (\u201c[D]enial of nationwide relief at this\n\npreliminary stage could make it less likely that the plaintiffs get complete relief\u2014that is, vacatur\u2014\n\nin the end.\u201d); see also 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A) (requiring reviewing courts, on final judgment, to\n\n\u201chold unlawful and set aside agency action\u201d that is \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion or\n\notherwise not in accordance with law\u201d).\n\n                                                ***\n\n       If this Court were to narrow the scope of relief, the Court should ensure that, at a bare\n\nminimum, the relief extends to all probationary employees whose residence or last duty station is\n\nwithin Plaintiff States. If notice was properly given then, at the very least, neighboring States\n\nwould have been able to adequately perform rapid response efforts for residents in Plaintiff States\n\nwho worked in non-Plaintiff States. See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2864(a)(2)(A)(i)(II); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 682.302,\n\n682.305. This could have mitigated the harms to the Plaintiff States. Although this alternative\n\nrelief would not fully remedy the harms suffered by Plaintiff States for the reasons described\n\nabove, preliminary relief that covers terminated employees who worked or lived within Plaintiff\n\n\n\n                                                 4\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 102        Filed 03/24/25      Page 5 of 9\n\n\n\n\nStates\u2019 borders would at least partially mitigate the administrative and financial harms suffered by\n\nthe Plaintiff States.\n\n\n\nMarch 24, 2025                                    Respectfully submitted,\n\n ANTHONY G.

Background\n       The federal government is costly, inefficient, and deeply in debt. At the same time, it is not\nproducing results for the American public. Instead, tax dollars are being siphoned off to fund\nunproductive and unnecessary programs that benefit radical interest groups while hurting hard-\nworking American citizens.\n\n        The American people registered their verdict on the bloated, corrupt federal bureaucracy\non November 5, 2024 by voting for President Trump and his promises to sweepingly reform the\nfederal government.\n\n       On February 11, 2025, President Trump\u2019s Executive Order Implementing The President\u2019s\n\u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency\u201d Workforce Optimization Initiative (Workforce\nOptimization) \u201ccommence[d] a critical transformation of the Federal bureaucracy.\u201d It directed\nagencies to \u201celiminat[e] waste, bloat, and insularity\u201d in order to \u201cempower American families,\nworkers, taxpayers, and our system of Government itself.\u201d\n\n         President Trump required that \u201cAgency Heads shall promptly undertake preparations to\ninitiate large-scale reductions in force (RIFs), consistent with applicable law.\u201d President Trump\nalso directed that, no later than March 13, 2025, agencies develop Agency Reorganization Plans.\n\n     The U.S. Office of Management and Budget (\u201cOMB\u201d) and the U.S. Office of Personnel\nManagement (\u201cOPM\u201d) now submit guidance on these Agency RIF and Reorganization Plans\n(\u201cARRP\u201d), along with the instruction that such plans be submitted to OMB and OPM.\n\n        II.    Principles to Inform ARRPs\n\n        ARRPs should seek to achieve the following:\n\n        1. Better service for the American people;\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 102-1         Filed 03/24/25      Page 3 of 8\n\n\n\n       2. Increased productivity;\n\n       3. A significant reduction in the number of full-time equivalent (FTE) positions by\n          eliminating positions that are not required;\n\n       4. A reduced real property footprint; and\n\n       5. Reduced budget topline.\n\n       Pursuant to the President\u2019s direction, agencies should focus on the maximum elimination\nof functions that are not statutorily mandated while driving the highest-quality, most efficient\ndelivery of their statutorily-required functions.\n\n       Agencies should also seek to consolidate areas of the agency organization chart that are\nduplicative; consolidate management layers where unnecessary layers exist; seek reductions in\ncomponents and positions that are non-critical; implement technological solutions that automate\nroutine tasks while enabling staff to focus on higher-value activities; close and/or consolidate\nregional field offices to the extent consistent with efficient service delivery; and maximally reduce\nthe use of outside consultants and contractors. When taking these actions, agencies should align\nclosures and/or relocation of bureaus and offices with agency return-to-office actions to avoid\nmultiple relocation benefit costs for individual employees.\n\n       Agencies should review their statutory authority and ensure that their plans and actions are\nconsistent with such authority.\n\n       Agency heads should collaborate with their Department of Government Efficiency\n(\u201cDOGE\u201d) team leads within the agency in developing competitive areas for ARRPs. In addition,\nthe agency should specifically identify competitive areas that include positions not typically\ndesignated as essential during a lapse in appropriations. When making this determination, agencies\nshould refer to the functions that are excepted from the Antideficiency Act (ADA) in the Agency\nContingency Plans submitted to OMB in 2019 as the starting point for making this determination.\n\n       III.    Available Tools\n\n        In their ARRPs, agencies should employ all available tools to effectuate the President\u2019s\ndirective for a more effective and efficient government and describe how they will use each. Such\ntools include:\n\n   1. Continuing to comply with the hiring freeze outlined in the January 20, 2025 Presidential\n      Memorandum Hiring Freeze or (with approval of OPM and OMB) implementing the\n      general principle that, subject to appropriate exemptions, no more than one employee\n      should be hired for every four employees that depart;\n\n   2. Establishing internal processes that ensure agency leadership has visibility and/or direct\n      sign-off on all potential job offers and candidates prior to extending offers;\n\n\n\n                                                 2\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB         Document 102-1        Filed 03/24/25      Page 4 of 8\n\n\n\n   3. Eliminating non-statutorily mandated functions through RIFs (Appendix 1 contains a\n      sample timeline);\n\n   4. Removing underperforming employees or employees engaged in misconduct, and\n      continuing to evaluate probationary employees;\n\n   5. Reducing headcount through attrition and allowing term or temporary positions to expire\n      without renewal;\n\n   6. Separating reemployed annuitants in areas likely subject to RIFs; and\n\n   7. Renegotiating provisions of collective bargaining agreements (CBAs) that would inhibit\n      enhanced government efficiency and employee accountability.\n\n        ARRPs should also list the competitive areas for large-scale reductions in force, the RIF\neffective dates (which may be a date prior to when the plan is submitted), the expected conclusion\nof the RIFs, the number of FTEs reduced, and additional impact of RIFs such as cancellation of\nrelated contracts, leases or overhead.\n\n       Agencies should also closely consider changes to regulations and agency policies,\nincluding changes that must be pursued through notice-and-comment rulemaking, that would lead\nto the reduction or elimination of agency subcomponents or speed up the implementation of\nARRPs.\n\n       IV.     Phase 1 ARRPs\n\n        Each agency will submit a Phase 1 ARRPs to OMB and OPM for review and approval no\nlater than March 13, 2025. Phase 1 ARRPs shall focus on initial agency cuts and reductions.\nEach Phase 1 ARRP should identify:\n\n   1. A list of agency subcomponents or offices that provide direct services to citizens. Such\n      subcomponents or offices should be included in ARRPs to improve services to citizens\n      while eliminating costs and reducing the size of the federal government. But for service\n      delivery subcomponents or offices, implementation shall not begin until certified by OMB\n      and OPM as resulting in a positive effect on the delivery of such services.\n\n   2. Any statutes that establish the agency, or subcomponents of the agency, as statutorily\n      required entities. Agency leadership must confirm statutes have not been interpreted in a\n      way that expands requirements beyond what the statute actually requires. Instead, statutes\n      should be interpreted to cover only what functions they explicitly require.\n\n   3. All agency components and employees performing functions not mandated by statute or\n      regulation who are not typically designated as essential during a lapse in appropriations\n      (because the functions performed by such employees do not fall under an exception to the\n      ADA) using the Agency Contingency Plans submitted to OMB in 2019 referenced above.\n\n\n\n                                                3\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 102-1        Filed 03/24/25     Page 5 of 8\n\n\n\n   4.

The specific tools the agency intends to use to achieve efficiencies, including, as to each,\n      the number of FTEs reduced and any potential savings or costs associated with such actions\n      in Fiscal Years 2025, 2026 and 2027:\n\n       a. Continuation of the current hiring freeze;\n       b. Regular attrition (e.g., retirement, movement between agencies and the private sector);\n       c. Attrition through enhanced policies governing employee performance and conduct;\n       d. Attrition through the termination or non-renewal of term or limited positions or\n          reemployed annuitants;\n       e. Attrition achieved by RIFs. Please refer to Appendix 1 for specific steps and timing.\n          For purposes of the Phase 1 ARRP, the agency should include the following\n          information:\n\n             i. The competitive areas and organizational components that the agency has\n                targeted or will target for initial RIFs, and\n            ii. The agency\u2019s target for reductions in FTE positions via RIFs.\n\n   6. A list by job position of all positions categorized as essential for purposes of exclusion\n      from large-scale RIFs, including the number per each job position and total by agency and\n      subcomponent.\n\n   7. The agency\u2019s suggested plan for congressional engagement to gather input and agreement\n      on major restructuring efforts and the movement of fundings between accounts, as\n      applicable, including compliance with any congressional notification requirements.\n\n\n   8. The agency\u2019s timetable and plan for implementing each part of its Phase 1 ARRP.\n\n       V.     Phase 2 ARRPs\n\n        Agencies should then submit a Phase 2 ARRP to OMB and OPM for review and approval\nno later than April 14, 2025. Phase 2 plans shall outline a positive vision for more productive,\nefficient agency operations going forward. Phase 2 plans should be planned for implementation by\nSeptember 30, 2025. The Phase 2 plan should include the following additional information:\n\n   1. The agency\u2019s proposed future-state organizational chart with its functional areas,\n      consolidated management hierarchy, and position titles and counts clearly depicted.\n\n   2.

Any components absorbing functions, including how this will be achieved in terms of FTE\n   positions, funding, and space.\n\n8. The agency\u2019s internal processes that ensure agency leadership has visibility and/or direct\n   sign-off on all potential job offers and candidates prior to extending offers.\n\n9. The agency\u2019s data-driven plan to ensure new career appointment hires are in highest-need\n   areas and adhere to the general principle that, subject to appropriate exemptions, no more\n   than one employee should be hired for every four employees that depart. Until the agency\n   has finalized its post-hiring-freeze plan, agencies should continue to adhere to the current\n   hiring freeze.\n\n10. Any provisions of collective bargaining agreements that would inhibit government\n    efficiency and cost-savings, and agency plans to renegotiate such provisions.\n\n11. An explanation of how the ARRPs will improve services for Americans and advance the\n    President\u2019s policy priorities.\n\n12.

For agencies that provide direct services to citizens (such as Social Security, Medicare, and\n    veterans\u2019 health care), the agency\u2019s certification that implementation of the ARRPs will\n    have a positive effect on the delivery of such services. The certification should include a\n    written explanation from the Agency Head and, where appropriate, the agency\u2019s CIO and\n    any relevant program manager.\n\n14. The programs and agency components not impacted by the ARRP, and the justification for\n    any exclusion.\n\n\n\n                                             5\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 102-1        Filed 03/24/25     Page 7 of 8\n\n\n\n   15. Plans to reduce costs and promote efficiencies through improved technology, including\n       through the adoption of new software or systems, and elimination of duplicative systems.\n\n   16. Any changes to regulations and agency policies, including changes that must be pursued\n       through notice-and-comment rulemaking, that would lead to the reduction or elimination\n       of agency subcomponents, or speed up implementation of ARRPs.\n\n   17. The agency\u2019s timetable and plan for implementing each part of its Phase 2 ARRP, and its\n       plan for monitoring and accountability in implementing its ARRPs.\n\n       Agencies should continue sending monthly progress reports each month on May 14, 2025,\nJune 16, 2025, and July 16, 2025. All plans and reports requested by this memorandum should be\nsubmitted to OPM at tracking@opm.gov and OMB at workforce@omb.eop.gov; when submitting\nplans and reports, please ensure both OPM and OMB addresses are included on the message.\n\n       VI.    Exclusions\n\n       Nothing in this memorandum shall have any application to:\n\n   1. Positions that are necessary to meet law enforcement, border security, national security,\n      immigration enforcement, or public safety responsibilities;\n\n   2.

The Executive Office of the President; or\n\n   5. The U.S. Postal Service.\n\n       Finally, agencies or components that provide direct services to citizens (such as Social\nSecurity, Medicare, and veterans\u2019 health care) shall not implement any proposed ARRPs until\nOMB and OPM certify that the plans will have a positive effect on the delivery of such services.\n\ncc: Chief Human Capital Officers (\u201cCHCOs\u201d), Deputy CHCOs, Human Resources Directors,\nChiefs of Staff, and DOGE team leads.\n\n\n\n\n                                               6\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB         Document 102-1        Filed 03/24/25       Page 8 of 8\n\n\n\n                             Appendix 1- Sample RIF Timeline\n\n        This sample timeline is prepared in accordance with the U.S. Office of Personnel\nManagement Workforce Reshaping Operations Handbook. RIF timing may vary based on\nagency-specific requirements, collective bargaining agreements, and workforce considerations.\nAgencies can accelerate these timelines through parallel processing, securing OPM waivers to\npolicy, expediting process steps, and streamlining stakeholder coordination.\n\nStep 1: Identification of Competitive Areas and Levels (by March 13, 2025 for Phase 1\nARRPs)\n\n   1. Identify competitive areas and levels and determine which positions may be affected. If\n      applicable, seek OPM waiver approval to adjust competitive areas within 90 days of the\n      RIF effective date.\n   2. For Phase 1 ARRPs, this step should be completed no later than March 13, 2025.\n\nStep 2: Planning, Preparation & Analysis (up to 30 days)\n\n   1. Explore use of VSIP/VERA.\n   2. Conduct an impact assessment.\n   3. Review position descriptions for accuracy, validate competitive levels, and verify\n      employee retention data (e.g., veteran preference, service computation dates).\n   4. Develop retention register.\n   5. Draft RIF notices and seek OPM waiver approval for a 30-day notification period.\n   6. Develop transition materials.\n   7. Notify unions (if required).\n   8. Prepare congressional notification (if required).\n\nStep 3: Formal RIF Notice Period (60 days, shortened to 30 days with an OPM waiver)\n\n   1. Issue official RIF notices.\n   2. Provide employees with appeal rights, career transition assistance, and priority placement\n      options.\n   3. Execute any required congressional notification and notice to the Department of Labor,\n      state, and local officials, if applicable.\n\nStep 4: RIF Implementation & Separation (Final Step)\n\n   1. Officially implement separations, reassignments, or downgrades.\n   2. Provide final benefits counseling, exit processing, and documentation.\n   3. Update HR systems and notify OPM of personnel actions.\n\n\n\n\n                                               7\n\f",

Plaintiffs, now relying upon the\n\ntemporary restraining order (\u201cTRO\u201d) issued by the Court on March 13, 2025, seek an extraordinary\n\nnationwide preliminary injunction and an equally extraordinary stay under Section 705 of the\n\nAdministrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d) (i) reinstating all terminated probationers, (ii) barring\n\nprospective probationer terminations absent individualized performance determinations, and (iii)\n\nrequiring ongoing status compliance reports by the federal agencies. But they cannot carry the\n\nhigh burden necessary to obtain any of that relief.\n\n       Beyond critical deficiencies in standing, Plaintiff States fail to establish a likelihood of\n\nsuccess on the merits, because they simply cannot show that Defendants\u2019 actions triggered the\n\nstatutory RIF Notice requirements. And the injunction they seek, in any event, would result in a\n\nprofound mismatch between the informational injury they assert (failure to receive pre-termination\n\nnotice) and the sweeping remedy they seek (reinstatement of thousands of terminated employees\n\nnationwide). The States also have no place in what is, at base, a dispute between several federal\n\nagencies and their terminated probationers.\n\n       The Motion should be denied. However, if the Court enters a preliminary injunction, it\n\nshould at most be limited to Plaintiff States (that demonstrate standing and irreparable harm).\n\nJudge Rushing\u2019s concurrence in a March 21 Fourth Circuit order in this case questioned the\n\ninappropriate nationwide scope of the injunctive relief Plaintiffs seek. Her concern was justified:\n\n\n\n\n                                                 1\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB            Document 101         Filed 03/24/25       Page 5 of 32\n\n\n\nThirty States have not claimed any injury of this type in any court, and one State has decided to\n\nlitigate its claims in a different judicial district. The Court should respect those 31 States\u2019 choices\n\nand tailor any relief to the parties to this action.\n\n                                           BACKGROUND\n\nI.      Statutory and Regulatory Background\n\n        Plaintiff States\u2019 case centers around 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502. That statute provides that when\n\nconducting a RIF\u2014which is a distinct \u201cadministrative procedure by which agencies eliminate jobs\n\nand reassign or separate employees who occupied the abolished positions,\u201d James v. Von\n\nZemenszky, 284 F. 3d 1310, 1314 (Fed. Cir. 2002), the government must follow certain notice\n\nprocedures. One such procedure requires providing 60 days\u2019 written notice to the employee. 5\n\nU.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d)(1)(A). And if the RIF would affect a \u201csignificant number of employees\u201d in a\n\njurisdiction, notice must also be provided to \u201cthe State or entity designated by the State to carry\n\nout rapid response activities under section 134(a)(2)(A) of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998.\u201d\n\nId. \u00a7 3502(d)(1)(B)1, (d)(3)(A)(i). Under OPM\u2019s implementing regulations, \u201c[w]hen 50 or more\n\nemployees in a competitive area receive separation notices under this part, the agency must provide\n\nwritten notification of the action, . . . . to \u2026 (1) the State \u2026. [t]o carry out rapid response activities\n\nunder \u2026 the Workforce Investment Act of 1988.\u201d 5 CFR \u00a7 351.803(b)(1).\n\n        Probationers are individuals whose employment with the federal government has not been\n\nfinalized. See 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.804. By statute, \u201cThe President may \u2026 provide \u2026 for a period of\n\nprobation\u201d for federal employees \u201cbefore an appointment in the competitive service becomes\n\n\n\n\n1\n  Specifically, \u00a7 3502(d)(1)(B) provides: \u201c[A]n employee may not be released, due to a reduction\nin force, unless (B) if the reduction in force would involve the separation of a significant number\nof employees, the [notice] requirements of [Section 3502(d)(3)] are met at least 60 days before any\nemployee is so released.\u201d (emphasis added).\n\n                                                       2\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 101        Filed 03/24/25      Page 6 of 32\n\n\n\nfinal.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3321(a)(1); see id. \u00a7 7511(a)(1). Employees in the excepted service are subject\n\nto a trial period of two years. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii). Exercising its statutory authority, OPM\n\nhas issued rules defining the probationary term for the competitive service and specifying that\n\nagencies \u201cshall utilize the probationary period as fully as possible to determine the fitness of the\n\nemployee and shall terminate his or her services during this period if the employee fails to\n\ndemonstrate fully his or her qualifications for continued employment.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 315.801,\n\n315.802, 315.803(a).\n\n       Employment-related disputes between federal employees and their employing agencies\n\nwithin the Executive Branch\u2014including challenges to employee removals or terminations\u2014are\n\ngoverned by the comprehensive, reticulated administrative-judicial review scheme set forth in the\n\nCivil Service Reform Act of 1978, Pub. L. No. 95-454, 92 Stat. 1111, codified at 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2101\n\net seq. (the \u201cCSRA\u201d). That expansive scheme also includes parallel provisions governing labor\n\nrelations between agencies and their employees, the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations\n\nStatute (the \u201cFSLMRS\u201d), set forth in Title VII of the CSRA (codified at 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7101-7135).\n\nTaken as a whole, the scheme governs nearly all aspects of the federal employer-employee\n\nrelationship, and largely covers the field when it comes to judicial rights and remedies for alleged\n\nconstitutional and statutory violations arising out of that relationship. As the D.C. Circuit has put\n\nit, \u201cwhat you get under the CSRA is what you get.\u201d Fornaro v. James, 416 F.3d 63, 67 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2005) (Roberts, J.).\n\n       Relevant here, the CSRA \u201cestablishe[s] a comprehensive system for reviewing personnel\n\naction taken against federal employees.\u201d Elgin v. Dep\u2019t of the Treasury, 567 U.S. 1, 5 (2012)\n\n(citation omitted). If an agency takes a statutorily defined major adverse action against a covered\n\nemployee\u2014including removal, see 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7512\u2014the employee may appeal that action to the\n\n\n\n\n                                                 3\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 101         Filed 03/24/25     Page 7 of 32\n\n\n\nMerit Systems Protection Board (\u201cMSPB\u201d) under the provisions of the CSRA\u2019s Chapter 75. Id.\n\n\u00a77513(d). The MSPB may order relief to prevailing employees, including reinstatement, backpay,\n\nand attorney\u2019s fees. Id. \u00a7\u00a7 1204(a)(2), 7701(g). Final MSPB decisions generally are appealable to\n\nthe Federal Circuit, which has \u201cexclusive jurisdiction\u201d over such appeals. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(9).\n\nThis review scheme is \u201cexclusive, even for employees who bring constitutional challenges to\n\nfederal statutes.\u201d Elgin, 567 U.S. at 13. Other than limited circumstances not relevant here, the\n\nCSRA does not permit covered employees to bring suit in federal district court. Id. at 14-15; United\n\nStates v. Fausto, 484 U.S. 439, 447 (1988); Fornaro, 416 F.3d at 67.\n\n       In contrast to tenured employees, terminated probationers generally do not enjoy the same\n\nguaranteed right to appeal removal decisions to the MSPB, as Congress excluded them from the\n\ndefinition of \u201cemployee[s]\u201d for purposes of the CSRA\u2019s Chapter 75. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7511(a)(1).\n\nInstead, probationers are still considered \u201capplicants\u201d under the extended hiring and evaluation\n\nperiod of the CSRA. And the CSRA, which sets forth the merit system principles underlying the\n\nentire statutory scheme and provides remedies for alleged violations of those principles, generally\n\napplies to both \u201capplicants and employees.\u201d See, e.g., 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(a)(2)(A)(i)\u2013(xii)\n\n(identifying \u201cpersonnel action[s]\u201d that may form the basis for alleged prohibited personnel\n\npractices \u201cwith respect to an employee in, or applicant for, a covered position in any agency\u201d).\n\n       In appropriate circumstances, terminated probationers may pursue relief resulting in MSPB\n\nadjudication, with judicial review thereafter. There are two main routes to such review. First, a\n\nremoved probationer may file a complaint alleging one or more statutorily defined \u201cprohibited\n\npersonnel practices\u201d with the Office of Special Counsel, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1211- 1219, et seq., which is\n\nstatutorily charged with investigating such complaints and which may in turn pursue\n\nadministrative relief before the MSPB. Second, under Office of Personnel Management (OPM)\n\n\n\n\n                                                 4\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB         Document 101        Filed 03/24/25      Page 8 of 32\n\n\n\nregulations, a removed probationer may appeal to the MSPB if he alleges that his removal was\n\nbased upon one of the reasons set forth in the regulations. See 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.806(b)-(d) (listing\n\nreasons such as discrimination on partisan political reasons, marital status, improper procedures,\n\nand discrimination on protected status).\n\nII.    Factual Background\n\n       On January 20, 2025, OPM transmitted a guidance memo to Executive Branch agencies\n\nemphasizing that probationary periods constitute \u201can essential tool for agencies to assess employee\n\nperformance.\u201d Memorandum from Charles Ezell, Acting Director, U.S. Office of Personnel\n\nManagement, to Heads and Acting Heads of Departments and Agencies, Guidance on Probationary\n\nPeriods, Administrative Leave and Details, at 1 (Jan. 20, 2025). The memo directed agencies to\n\n\u201cidentify all employees on probationary periods\u201d and \u201cpromptly determine whether those\n\nemployees should be retained at the agency.\u201d Id. On March 4, OPM issued revised guidance\n\nemphasizing that agencies \u201chave ultimate decision-making authority over, and responsibility for,\n\nsuch personnel actions.\u201d Memorandum from Charles Ezell, Acting Director, U.S. Office of\n\nPersonnel Management, to Heads and Acting Heads of Departments, Guidance on Probationary\n\nPeriods, Administrative Leave and Details, at 2 (rev. Mar. 4, 2025), https://perma.cc/E8P5-74WZ.\n\n       Invoking their legal authorities to manage their workforces, certain federal agencies have\n\nterminated certain probationary employees. In its TRO opinion (\u201cOp.\u201d) (Dkt. No. 43), the Court\n\nfound that \u201cat least 24,000 probationary employees\u201d have been terminated. See Op. 7. Plaintiff\n\nStates allege that they \u201cwere not provided any notice of such terminations.\u201d Id.\n\nIII.   Procedural Background\n\n       Plaintiff States sued on March 6, 2025, and moved for a TRO the following day. See Dkt.\n\nNos. 1 (Compl.) and 4 (Mot. For TRO). Their requested TRO would \u201crestrain[] Defendants from\n\n\n\n\n                                                5\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 101           Filed 03/24/25     Page 9 of 32\n\n\n\nterminating   federal   probationary     employees     without    making    specific,   individualized\n\ndeterminations regarding the inadequacy of the employee\u2019s conduct or performance\u201d and\n\n\u201c[c]ompel[] Defendants to reinstate federal probationary employees fired on or after January 20,\n\n2025, as part of mass terminations that did not comply with RIF procedures and were not based\n\non individual determinations of conduct or performance.\u201d Dkt. No. 4, at 2.\n\n       On March 13, following briefing and a hearing, the Court substantially granted Plaintiffs\u2019\n\nmotion. It concluded that Plaintiff States had shown standing. Op. 14-15, 19-21. It rejected\n\nDefendants\u2019 argument that claims concerning termination of federal employment may only be\n\npursued under the CSRA and the FSLMRS. The Court recognized that the statutory scheme\n\n\u201cforecloses any possibility of the States bringing their claims before an administrative agency\u201d\n\nbecause only unions, employees, and applicants for employment have rights under those statutes.\n\nId. 26. But the Court used this as a basis to counterintuitively conclude that States could\n\ncollaterally attack the federal hiring decisions through other channels. And on the merits, the Court\n\nfound that the government\u2019s termination of probationary employees constituted a RIF because the\n\n\u201cterminated probationary employees were plainly not terminated for cause.\u201d Id. 33; see also, e.g.,\n\nid. at 38 (\u201cThe wholesale dismissal of employees due to their status as probationary employees\n\nappears to be some form of reorganization, even if the Government does not refer to it as such.\u201d).\n\nThe Court then held that the government had failed to comply with the requirements governing\n\nRIFs, including advance notice to states. See id. at 37-38.\n\n       While acknowledging that any harms faced by the states were \u201clargely economic,\u201d the\n\nCourt nevertheless said such harms were irreparable \u201cbecause money damages are likely not\n\navailable\u201d from the federal government. Id. 41. So too did a \u201cdiversion of resources\u201d resulting\n\nfrom the lack of notice also constitute an irreparable harm. Id. at 42. For the last two factors, which\n\n\n\n\n                                                  6\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB             Document 101    Filed 03/24/25      Page 10 of 32\n\n\n\nmerge when the government is a defendant, the Court found that the balance of the equities and\n\nthe public interest favored the states. Id. at 42-44.\n\n        The TRO is extraordinarily broad: the Court ordered that Restrained Defendants must\n\nreinstate \u201call Affected Probationary Employees throughout the United States FORTHWITH, and\n\nin any event before March 17, 2025, at 1:00 p.m. EDT.\u201d Dkt. No. 44, at \u00b6 3. It further issued an\n\ninjunction directing that Restrained Defendants shall not \u201cconduct any future \u2026 [RIFs]\u2014whether\n\nformally labeled as such or not\u2014except in compliance with\u201d statutory and regulatory\n\nrequirements. Id. at \u00b6 4. Ordering this relief nationwide\u2014including in the 30 states that did not\n\njoin any suit like this and in the one that chose to litigate elsewhere\u2014the Court reasoned that\n\nbecause the \u201cGovernment\u2019s policy is violative of the law across the board, it is appropriate for\n\ninjunctive relief to be nationwide in scope.\u201d Op. 48. Because it \u201cwould order nationwide relief\n\neven if just a single State had standing,\u201d the Court declined to determine which states other than\n\nMaryland had standing. See id. at 18 n.3.\n\n        On March 17, 2025, Defendants appealed the TRO to the Fourth Circuit and moved for a\n\nstay pending appeal and an immediate administrative stay. Following briefing, the Fourth Circuit\n\ndenied that motion on March 21, noting this Court\u2019s stated intention to hold a hearing on March\n\n26 and to promptly grant or deny preliminary injunctive relief thereafter. See Doc. 20, No. 25-\n\n1248, at 3-4 (4th Cir. Mar. 21, 2025).\n\n        Judge Rushing concurred in the motion panel\u2019s ruling, writing separately \u201cto echo the\n\ngrowing concerns over district courts issuing nationwide injunctions to order redress for those who\n\nhave not sought it.\u201d Id. Her concurrence expressed substantial concern as to the TRO:\n\n      The district court here required numerous federal agencies to reinstate fired\n      probationary workers across all 50 States. It ordered relief because Plaintiffs\u2014which\n      are 19 States and the District of Columbia\u2014asserted an injury stemming from the\n      federal government\u2019s failure to notify the States of its intent to fire probationary\n\n\n\n                                                   7\n\f        Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 101         Filed 03/24/25      Page 11 of 32\n\n\n\n        employees within their territory. But the district court extended its injunction to cover\n        non-plaintiff States because (1) \u201cthe Government\u2019s policy is violative of the law across\n        the board,\u201d and (2) it \u201cwould be inequitable\u201d for a federal employee\u2019s status to turn on\n        \u201cthe fortuity of their physical location.\u201d State of Maryland v. USDA, 1:25-cv-748, slip\n        op. at 48 (D. Md. Mar. 13, 2025).\n\n        Neither reason holds water. As the district court noted, federal law requires an agency\n        to notify a State of a reduction in force (RIF) when 50 or more employees in a\n        \u201ccompetitive area\u201d\u2014a unit definable by the agency but which must be linked to\n        geography\u2014receive separation notices. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 351.803(b), 351.405; see 5 U.S.C.\n        \u00a7 3502(d)(3). Plaintiffs identify no allegations or evidence before the district court\n        showing that 50 or more employees were terminated in competitive areas in non-\n        plaintiff States\u2014that is, the 31 States that opted not to join this lawsuit. Accordingly,\n        the court had no basis to conclude that the government violated federal law by failing\n        to notify those States about any RIFs, and consequently no basis to conclude that the\n        government\u2019s actions were illegal \u201cacross the board.\u201d\n\n        Further, the district court lost sight of who the Plaintiffs are and what injury they claim\n        when it concluded a nationwide injunction was warranted. The States seek redress for\n        their own purported injuries flowing from the lack of notice, not for an injury to their\n        citizens. Accordingly, the question is not whether it is inequitable for a federal\n        employee\u2019s reinstatement to turn on his State of residence, but rather whether it is\n        inequitable to redress notice-based injuries only for those States that actually claim to\n        be injured by the lack of notice.

To\n\nestablish standing, and invoke the Court\u2019s jurisdiction, the States \u201cmust show\u201d that they have\n\n\u201csuffered, or will suffer, an injury that is \u2018concrete, particularized, and actual or imminent; fairly\n\ntraceable to the challenged action; and redressable by a favorable ruling.\u2019\u201d Murthy v. Missouri, 603\n\nU.S. 43, 57 (2024) (quoting Clapper v. Amnesty Int\u2019l USA, 568 U.S. 398, 409 (2013)).\n\n       Plaintiff States claim injury from Defendants\u2019 probationary terminations because (a) the\n\nStates did not receive notice in advance, and (b) the terminations require the States to provide\n\nadditional services, while also causing a loss of tax revenues. See Br. 13 & 14 n.6 (arguing that\n\ntheir \u201ccentral injury is an information injury,\u201d which in turn caused other various downstream\n\nharms such as a loss of state income tax revenues.) This standing argument is flawed in two ways.\n\n       First, an \u201cinformational injury\u201d on its own does not create Article III standing. See\n\nTransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 594 U.S. 413, 442 (2021). So simply pointing to the failure to provide\n\nthe allegedly required statutory-based notice is insufficient for injury. Instead, the asserted\n\ninformational injury must cause \u201creal\u201d harms that \u201care of the type that have traditionally been\n\nregarded as providing a basis for a lawsuit in English or American courts.\u201d Dreher v. Experian\n\nInfo. Sols., Inc., 856 F.3d 337, 345 (4th Cir. 2017) (citation omitted). Plaintiffs and the Court\n\nidentify purported \u201cdownstream\u201d harms to state resources, but those cannot suffice, as explained\n\nbelow. See, e.g., Op. 14-15 (citing \u201cincreased\u201d unemployment claims and need to \u201cdivert money\n\nand human resources\u201d to provide services and benefit programs).\n\n\n\n\n                                                  10\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB            Document 101       Filed 03/24/25      Page 14 of 32\n\n\n\n        Second, Plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cdownstream\u201d theory of injury is not viable, in light of United States v.\n\nTexas, 599 U.S. 670, 674 (2023). There, the Supreme Court rejected a theory of state standing\n\nmaterially similar to that advanced here. The gist of theory in Texas was that States could sue\n\nbased on \u201cdownstream\u201d costs imposed and resources expended in response to a federal government\n\naction. Id. (citing the obligation to \u201csupply social services such as healthcare and education\u201d to\n\nadditional persons). The Supreme Court rejected this theory. \u201c[I]n our system of dual federal and\n\nstate sovereignty, federal policies frequently generate indirect effects on state revenues or state\n\nspending.\u201d Id. at 680 n.3. And a theory of standing based on those indirect effects is \u201cmore\n\nattenuated\u201d and less likely to succeed. Id.; accord, e.g., Arizona v. Biden, 40 F.4th 375, 386 (6th\n\nCir. 2022) (rejecting contention that any federal policy that \u201cimposes peripheral costs on a State\n\ncreates a cognizable Article III injury\u201d). The States here claim similar injuries. See, e.g., Dkt. No.\n\n1, \u00b6\u00b6 171, 179; threatened increased enrollment in social services such as Medicaid, e.g., id. \u00b6\u00b6\n\n205-206; and caused the states to expend funds to establish informational resources for their\n\ncitizens, e.g., id. \u00b6\u00b6 168, 202, 205.\n\n        Even assuming that Plaintiffs\u2019 claimed-\u201cstatutory right of notice\u201d alone could give rise to\n\nan \u201cinformational injury\u201d that suffices as an injury-in-fact, they cannot establish redressability for\n\nthat injury. Specifically, a plaintiff seeking injunctive relief on a theory of informational injury\n\nmust assert that a judicial order would lead him to obtain information he lacks\u2014\u201c[a]s when an\n\nagency denies requests for information under the Freedom of Information Act.\u201d Pub. Citizen v.\n\nU.S. Dep\u2019t of Just., 491 U.S. 440, 449 (1989); see also, e.g., Fed. Election Comm\u2019n v. Akins, 524\n\nU.S. 11, 21 (1998). Here, at least as to terminations that have already occurred, the states do not\n\nallege that any information is presently being withheld from them. Any informational injury no\n\nlonger exists and could not possibly be grounds for the district court\u2019s sweeping reinstatement\n\n\n\n\n                                                 11\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 101        Filed 03/24/25      Page 15 of 32\n\n\n\norder. Thus, a favorable decision will not remedy the \u201cinformational injury\u201d here. A basic\n\nmismatch exists between the informational injury the states assert (failure to receive pre-\n\ntermination notice) and the sweeping remedy requested here (reinstatement of thousands of\n\nterminated employees). That relief does nothing to remedy the states\u2019 asserted informational injury\n\nbecause it does not provide them the information that they alleged was not provided.\n\n       In its TRO Opinion, the Court relied upon Laufer v. Naranda Hotels, LLC, 60 F.4th 156,\n\n171 (4th Cir. 2023), to observe that \u201c[i]nformational injury has long been recognized as a valid\n\ninjury in fact.\u201d Op. 14. But Laufer was brought by a disabled plaintiff who alleged that a hotel\n\nwebsite failed to comply with a regulation requiring it to \u201c[i]dentify and describe accessible\n\nfeatures in the hotels and guest rooms.\u201d Laufer, 60 F.4th at 159 (alteration in original) (quotation\n\nmarks omitted). She alleged that she \u201csuffered an informational injury\u201d because she had been\n\ndeprived of \u201cinformation required to make meaningful choices for travel.\u201d Id. at 160 (quotation\n\nmarks omitted). She accordingly sought \u201cdeclaratory and injunctive relief,\u201d id. at 158\u2014in\n\nparticular, an order requiring the hotel \u201cto revise its websites to comply\u201d with the regulation.\n\nAmended Complaint at 9, Laufer v. Naranda Hotels LLC, No. 1:20-cv- 02136-CCB (D. Md. Aug.\n\n17, 2020), ECF No. 4. The court accepted that Laufer had \u201calleged an informational injury that\n\ngives her Article III standing to sue,\u201d Laufer, 60 F.4th at 166, and given the obvious connection\n\nbetween the asserted injury (missing information) and the requested relief (an order to provide it),\n\nthe Court observed that the defendant had not even contested redressability in district court, id. at\n\n167. Here, Plaintiff States\u2019 \u201cinformational injury\u201d is entirely different. They are not seeking a\n\njudicial order compelling the provision of information; they make no argument showing how\n\nreinstatements would redress the \u201cinformational injury\u201d that they assert. See Br. 16-17.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 12\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 101         Filed 03/24/25       Page 16 of 32\n\n\n\n           2. The CSRA Provides The Exclusive Remedies For All Claims Concerning The\n              Termination Of Federal Employees\n\n       Even if the States had Article III standing, Plaintiffs still fail to show that they are likely to\n\nprevail on the merits, because the Court lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate the challenges to the\n\nemployment decisions of federal agencies. Instead, as explained above, Congress \u201cestablished a\n\ncomprehensive system\u201d that provides the \u201cexclusive means\u201d for reviewing such matters. Elgin,\n\n567 U.S. 5, 8 (quotation marks omitted). Plaintiffs claim that the CSRA and FSLMRS do not\n\npreclude federal court jurisdiction. Br. at 14. This is incorrect.\n\n       The CSRA, together with the FSLMRS, \u201ccreates an integrated scheme of administrative\n\nand judicial review, wherein the Congress intentionally provided\u2014and intentionally chose not to\n\nprovide\u2014particular forums and procedures for particular kinds of claims.\u201d Ame. Fed\u2019n of Gov\u2019t\n\nEmps. v. Sec\u2019y of the Air Force, 716 F.3d 633, 636 (D.C. Cir. 2023) (alterations, citation, and\n\nquotations marks omitted). Congress allowed certain individual federal employees who are\n\naffected by agency personnel decisions to challenge those decisions \u201cby litigating their claims\n\nthrough the statutory scheme in the context of [a] concrete\u201d dispute, albeit limited to the claims\n\nand remedies provided by Congress. See Am. Fed\u2019n of Gov\u2019t Emps. v. Trump, 929 F.3d 748, 757\n\n(D.C. Cir. 2019).\n\n       In its TRO decision, the Court never disputed that if this lawsuit were brought by the real\n\nparties in interest\u2014terminated probationary employees\u2014it could proceed only through the scheme\n\nenacted by Congress. See, e.g., Op. 24 (\u201cCongress has provided for the exclusive administrative\n\nreview of most employment claims brought by federal employees \u2026.\u201d); see also, e.g., Fornaro,\n\n416 F.3d at 67 (\u201c[W]hat you get under the CSRA is what you get.\u201d). Yet the court concluded that\n\nthose statutory limitations are irrelevant because Congress failed to include states among the\n\nparties who may bring claims under that scheme. See Op. 26, 30. That has it backwards. \u201c[T]he\n\n\n\n                                                  13\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 101         Filed 03/24/25       Page 17 of 32\n\n\n\nCSRA is the exclusive avenue for suit even if the plaintiff cannot prevail.\u201d Grosdidier v.\n\nChairman, Broad. Bd. of Governors, 560 F.3d 495, 497 (D.C. Cir. 2009).\n\n       Supreme Court precedent makes clear that when a comprehensive scheme permits review\n\nat the behest of some types of plaintiffs but not others, it implicitly precludes review by plaintiffs\n\nwho are not authorized to bring claims. In Block v. Community Nutrition Institute, 467 U.S. 340,\n\n347 (1984), the Supreme Court considered a statute that permitted dairy handlers to obtain review\n\nof certain \u201cmarket orders\u201d after exhausting administrative remedies, but did not authorize review\n\nby anyone else. See id. at 346 (citing 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 608c). When a group of dairy consumers sought\n\nreview of a marketing order, the Supreme Court explained that the statute omits a \u201cprovision for\n\nparticipation by consumers in any proceeding,\u201d and that \u201c[i]n a complex scheme of this type, the\n\nomission of such a provision is sufficient reason to believe that Congress intended to foreclose\n\nconsumer participation in the regulatory process.\u201d Id. at 347. Accordingly, the Court explained,\n\nthe \u201cstructure of this Act indicates that Congress intended only producers and handlers, and not\n\nconsumers, to ensure that the statutory objectives would be realized.\u201d Id. And the \u201crestriction of\n\nthe administrative remedy to handlers strongly suggests that Congress intended a similar restriction\n\nof judicial review of market orders.\u201d Id. Any other holding would facilitate circumvention of the\n\ncomprehensive statutory scheme. See id. at 348.\n\n       The principles described in Block apply with full force to the CSRA. See Fausto, 484 U.S.\n\nat 448 (1988) (applying Block to conclude that certain employees who lack CSRA appeal rights\n\n\u201cshould not be able to demand judicial review for the type of personnel action covered by that\n\nchapter\u201d). Just as Congress \u201cintentionally foreclosed judicial review to employees who \u2026 are\n\nsubjected to disciplinary actions which are modest in nature,\u201d Pinar v. Dole, 747 F.2d 899, 912\n\n(4th Cir. 1984), it intentionally foreclosed judicial review by parties other than those it specifically\n\n\n\n\n                                                  14\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 101           Filed 03/24/25   Page 18 of 32\n\n\n\nauthorized to seek relief. Any other result would encourage litigants to \u201cbypass the statutory and\n\nadministrative remedies in order to seek direct judicial relief and thereby deprive the Government\n\nof the opportunity to work out its personnel problems within the framework it has so painstakingly\n\nestablished.\u201d Id. at 913 (citation omitted).\n\n       In short, Congress did not leave a gaping hole in the CSRA by disallowing states from\n\nchallenging federal employees\u2019 terminations on their behalf, simply because there were large\n\nnumbers terminated at or around the same time. Indeed, such an interpretation would be utterly at\n\nodds with Congress\u2019s intent in enacting the CSRA, which was to replace a \u201cpatchwork system with\n\nan integrated scheme of administrative and judicial review.\u201d Fausto, 484 U.S. at 445. Rather,\n\nCongress limited review of federal employment actions to actions by affected employees\n\nthemselves, in specified administrative and judicial fora.\n\n       Plaintiffs emphasize that Congress could not have intended to preclude the States\u2019 claims,\n\nbecause that would place the Plaintiff States \u201cin the odd position of possessing a right without\n\nremedy.\u201d Br. at 15, 16. But again, there is nothing \u201codd\u201d about that, where, by design, Congress\n\nintended to permit review of federal employment actions to administrative or judicial actions by\n\naffected employees themselves, in a different forum.\n\n           3. Plaintiffs Fail to Make a Showing that Defendants\u2019 Actions Triggered the\n              Statutory RIF Notice Requirements.\n\n       The thrust of Plaintiff States\u2019 motion is that Defendants\u2019 probationary terminations\n\namounted to an unannounced statutory RIF, which triggered Notice requirements\u2014and that the\n\nproffered reason for those terminations was pretextual. Br. 10-13. But a statutory RIF does not\n\noccur whenever the government terminates a large number of employees. Statutory RIFs authorize\n\nan agency to eliminate positions and release employees through a defined process when \u201crequired\n\nbecause of lack of work; shortage of funds; insufficient personnel ceiling; reorganization; the\n\n\n\n                                                15\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 101        Filed 03/24/25      Page 19 of 32\n\n\n\nexercise of reemployment rights or restoration rights; or reclassification of an employee\u2019s position\n\nd[u]e to erosion of duties.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.201(a)(2). The regulation applies only \u201cwhen the agency\n\ndetermines that a reduction in force is necessary.\u201d Id. \u00a7 351.204. Plaintiffs incorrectly assert that\n\n\u201cDefendants do not dispute that they failed to comply with the [advance notice requirements, set\n\nforth in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d)(3)(A); and 5 CFR \u00a7 351.803(b)].\u201d See Br. 12. Plaintiffs have not\n\nshown that Defendants made the findings required for the RIF statute to apply. Defendants thus\n\nhad no compliance obligations under the RIF statute.\n\n       The Court supported its conclusion that the RIF statute applied with the suggestion that\n\nDefendants made improper terminations of probationers. The Court focused on the numbers\n\ninvolved, suggesting that \u201c[t]he wholesale dismissal of employees due to their status as\n\nprobationary employees appears to be some form of reorganization.\u201d Op. 38.\n\n       However, it is not correct that probationary employees can be terminated only for\n\nindividual performance issues. The OPM regulations do not purport to be exclusive, but even if\n\nthey were, the language in those regulations, including \u201cqualifications\u201d and \u201cfitness\u201d (as explained\n\nbelow), necessarily encompasses agency priorities and resources. However, even if probationary\n\nemployees could be terminated only for individual performance problems, terminating them\n\nwithout cause would not make the termination a statutory RIF subject to notice requirements\u2014it\n\nwould simply give the probationary employees an argument to take through channeling.\n\n                   (a) The Court Wrongly Concluded the OPM Performance Regulations\n                       Required Individualized Assessment for Any Probationary Employees\n                       Prior to Termination\n\n       The Court erred when it concluded, essentially, that outside of a RIF, probationary\n\nemployees can be terminated only for individual performance issues. The Court stated that\n\n\u201cagencies are permitted to terminate probationary employees under only three circumstances: (1)\n\n\n\n\n                                                 16\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 101         Filed 03/24/25      Page 20 of 32\n\n\n\ndue to conditions arising prior to their employment, 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.805; (2) due to unsatisfactory\n\nperformance or conduct, 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.804(a); and (3) pursuant to a RIF.\u201d Op. 33. The Court\u2019s\n\nconclusion is mistaken for at least three reasons.\n\n       First, OPM\u2019s regulations, 5 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 315.803(a), 315.804, and 315.805, do not purport to\n\nbe exclusive. Plaintiffs, who carry the burden here, fail to point to any source suggesting that OPM\n\nintended that these regulations purport to be the exclusive manner of terminating probationary\n\nemployees. The court mistakenly interpreted these OPM regulations (5 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 315.803(a),\n\n315.804, and 315.805) to limit agencies\u2019 authority to terminate probationary employees for\n\nindividual performance issues only (outside of a RIF).\n\n       OPM regulations governing probationary employees do not limit agencies\u2019 authority to\n\nremove probationary employees for non-performance-based reasons. The Court\u2019s overreading of\n\nthe import of these regulations further underscores the weakness of Plaintiffs\u2019 merits arguments.\n\nWhile the OPM regulations authorize removals of probationary employees for performance-based\n\nreasons, they do not purport to limit agencies\u2019 authority to remove probationary employees for\n\nother reasons, including the reasons identified by the agencies here. See, e.g., Br. 6 (quoting letters\n\nwhich stated that \u201cin accordance with the direction to agencies to reduce budgets, implement a\n\nhiring freeze, reorganize and reprioritize our work and prepare for a reduction in force, we have\n\ncome to the conclusion that we cannot continue with the current staffing levels.\u201d); id. (\u201c[Y]ou have\n\nnot demonstrated that your further employment with [the Agency] would be in the public\n\ninterest\u201d). Nothing in the OPM regulations says that agencies cannot conduct assessments of an\n\nemployee\u2019s utility to the agency in light of resource constraints and agency priorities.\n\n       Thus, an agency\u2019s authority to terminate probationary employees is not limited to the\n\nexpress authorities set forth in \u00a7 315.803(a) and \u00a7 315.804. To the contrary, although OPM\u2019s\n\n\n\n\n                                                  17\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB               Document 101            Filed 03/24/25         Page 21 of 32\n\n\n\nregulations provide these bases to terminate competitive service probationary employees,2 they do\n\nnot purport to describe the only authority for doing so. See Yu v. Dep\u2019t of Army, 28 Fed. App\u2019x\n\n968, 971 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (nonprecedential) (\u201cHowever, the agency need not show unsatisfactory\n\nperformance in order to discontinue employment during a probationary period; the only grounds\n\nfor appeal are those set in 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.806(b)-(c) and \u00a7 1201.3(a)(8).\u201d).\n\n        Second, even if the regulation was exclusive, OPM\u2019s regulation \u00a7 315.803(a) provides\n\nindependent authority, separate from the RIF regulations, for agencies to terminate competitive\n\nservice probationary employees if the agency decides that paying their salary is unwarranted given\n\nthe agency\u2019s current priorities.         Section 315.803 (\u201cAgency action during probation period\n\n(general)\u201d) provides in subpart (a), \u201cThe agency shall utilize the probationary period as fully as\n\npossible to determine the fitness of the employee and shall terminate his or her services during this\n\nperiod if the employee fails to demonstrate fully his or her qualifications for continued\n\nemployment.\u201d As for competitive service probationary employees, the phrases \u201cfitness of the\n\nemployee\u201d and \u201chis or her qualifications for continued employment\u201d in section 315.803(a)\n\nencompass an analysis of whether the individual\u2019s abilities warrant continued employment in light\n\nof current agency priorities.\n\n        Indeed, \u201cqualification\u201d is defined as \u201cA quality, ability, or accomplishment that makes a\n\nperson suitable for a particular position or task.\u201d The American Heritage Dictionary of the\n\nEnglish Language, New College Edition (5th ed. 2022)3 (emphasis added). Likewise, \u201cfitness\u201d is\n\n\n2\n  OPM regulations expressly authorize the termination of probationary employees. See 5 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 315.803(a);\n315.804(a). But by their terms, these provisions apply to probationary employees of the competitive service; they\ndo not apply to excepted service probationary employees. See De Santis v. MSPB, 826 F.3d 1369, 1372 (Fed. Cir.\n2016) (explaining that 5 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 315.805 and 315.806(c) \u201cgrant to a terminated probationary employee, but only\none in the competitive service, certain procedural rights and a right of appeal to the Board where the employee\nmakes a non-frivolous allegation that the termination rested wholly or partly on conditions arising before\nappointment.\u201d). Thus, any reliance upon these regulations to address probationary excepted service employees is\nmisplaced.\n3\n  Available at: https://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?\n\n\n                                                        18\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 101        Filed 03/24/25      Page 22 of 32\n\n\n\ndefined as \u201csuitability or appropriateness.\u201d      Id. Accordingly, the person\u2019s fitness and/or\n\nqualifications must be considered in light of the specific tasks agencies need performed. These\n\nregulations provide independent authority, separate from the RIF regulations, for agencies to\n\nterminate competitive service probationary employees if the agency decides that paying their\n\nsalary is unwarranted given the agency\u2019s current priorities.\n\n       Third, agencies have broad discretion to remove probationary employees. In order to\n\nestablish that agencies violated the law by removing them, probationary employees must point to\n\nsome statute or regulation that agencies violated by removing them. Plaintiffs cannot do so. To\n\nthe contrary, the governing authorities emphasize agencies\u2019 discretion to terminate probationary\n\nemployees. In the CSRA, Congress enacted a carefully crafted comprehensive scheme governing\n\nall aspects of the federal employer-employee relationship. Even as it created an elaborate system\n\nallowing certain employees to challenge some personnel actions, Congress chose not to extend\n\nthose rights to probationary employees. See United States v. Connolly, 716 F.2d 882, 886 (Fed.\n\nCir. 1983). As the legislative history of the CSRA demonstrates, Congress recognized that \u201c[t]he\n\nprobationary or trial period ... is an extension of the examining process to determine an employee\u2019s\n\nability to actually perform the duties of the position,\u201d and \u201c[i]t is inappropriate to restrict an\n\nagency\u2019s authority to separate an employee who does not perform acceptably during this\n\nperiod.\u201d Id. (citing S.Rep. No. 969, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 45 (1978), reprinted in 1978 U.S.Code\n\nCong. & Ad.News 2723, 2767.) Thus, the CSRA preserved agencies\u2019 broad authority to terminate\n\nprobationary employees, and Plaintiffs must identify some statutory constraint to prevail\u2014which\n\nthey have not done.\n\n       In this light, given that Congress chose to instead treat probationary employment as an\n\n\u201cextension of the examining process,\u201d id. (citation omitted), it would be doubly inappropriate to\n\n\n\n\n                                                19\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB                Document 101             Filed 03/24/25         Page 23 of 32\n\n\n\nread in implied judicial avenues for challenging terminations, and to allow the inclusion of States\n\nas parties who can challenger termination of probationary employment. Cf. Fausto, 484 U.S. at\n\n447 (Congress\u2019s silence on category of employees \u201cdisplays a clear congressional intent to deny\n\nthe excluded employees the protections of Chapter 75\u2014including judicial review\u2014for personnel\n\naction covered by that chapter.\u201d).4\n\n         In sum, Plaintiff States, as movants for the injunction, fail to carry their burden of making\n\na \u201cclear showing\u201d that this analysis is incorrect. In fact, their moving papers do not even reference\n\nOPM\u2019s regulations, \u00a7\u00a7 315.803, 315.804, or 315.805.\n\n                       (b) Even if probationary employees could be terminated only for individual\n                           performance problems, that does not mean that terminations without\n                           sufficient cause are RIF subject to notice requirements.\n\n         Even if hypothetically probationary employees could be terminated only for individual\n\nperformance issues (as the Court essentially concluded), and defendants had terminated certain\n\nprobationary employees without sufficient cause, that does not make the termination a RIF subject\n\nto notice requirements. Rather, in that case, the termination without sufficient cause would be a\n\nclaim that only those affected employees may pursue\u2014and in certain cases are pursuing\u2014through\n\nchanneling, i.e., through the procedures created by the CSRA. See Dkt. No. 20, at 8 (describing\n\nhow some probationers have pursued relief before the Office of Special Counsel and the MSPB).\n\nAgain, that in itself would not mean the government inadvertently has conducted unlawful RIFs\n\nthat should have involved a notice requirement.\n\n\n\n\n4\n  The Court cited McGuffin v. SSA, 942 F.3d 1099, 1102 (Fed. Cir. 2019), for the proposition that the employer\n\u201cmust honestly be dissatisfied with the probationer\u2019s conduct or performance after giving him a fair trial on the job.\u201d\nSee Op. 35. But the protections required by the court there relate to an entirely different statute, which Plaintiffs do\nnot invoke in this matter. Specifically, McGuffin concerned an employee who was terminated during his one-year\nprobationary period in part because of his veteran status, which the court held violated the Uniformed Services\nEmployment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA). 38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4301-35. Plaintiffs have not brought a claim\nunder USERRA here, so that analysis does not bear on this case.\n\n\n                                                          20\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 101         Filed 03/24/25      Page 24 of 32\n\n\n\n       For these reasons, Plaintiffs cannot make a \u201cclear showing\u201d that Defendants\u2019 actions\n\ntriggered the statutory RIF notice requirements, and therefore (in addition to the other reasons\n\nexplained above) cannot establish that they are likely to succeed on the merits.\n\n       B. Plaintiff States Are Unable to Show They Likely Will Suffer Irreparable Harm in\n          the Absence of Preliminary Relief.\n\n       To show irreparable injury, a plaintiff must make a \u201cclear showing\u201d that it will suffer harm\n\nthat is \u201c\u2018neither remote nor speculative, but actual and imminent.\u2019\u201d Direx Israel, Ltd. v.\n\nBreakthrough Med. Corp., 952 F.2d 802, 812 (4th Cir. 1991) (internal citation omitted). In\n\naddition, harm is irreparable only when it \u201ccannot be fully rectified by the final judgment after\n\ntrial.\u201d Mountain Valley Pipeline, LLC v. 6.56 Acres of Land, Owned by Sandra Townes Powell,\n\n915 F.3d 197, 216 (4th Cir. 2019) (internal citation omitted).            \u201cMere injuries, however\n\ninsubstantial, in terms of money, time and energy necessarily expended in the absence of [an\n\ninjunction] are not enough.\u201d Roe v. Department of Defense, 947 F.3d 207, 228 (4th Cir. 2020)\n\n(internal citations omitted).\n\n       Plaintiffs do not make a \u201cclear showing\u201d here. They argue that \u201ceach day that federal\n\nprobationary workers are left unemployed means rising and likely unrecoverable administrative\n\ncosts for Plaintiff States,\u201d (Br. 16), but cite to no authority establishing that as irreparable harm.\n\n(New York v. Yellen, 15 F.4th 569, 577 (2d Cir. 2021) at Br. 17 concerns standing.) Moreover,\n\nthat harm is not fairly traceable to the informational injury alleged; it is instead tied to the\n\nterminations themselves, which plaintiffs are barred from challenging in this litigation due to the\n\nchanneling statutes. While the TRO Opinion reasoned that the unavailability of money damages\n\nfor APA claims counsels in favor of finding irreparable harm (Op. 41), this overlooks the\n\nperipheral and incidental nature of these costs. At base, the reality of any firing of a federal\n\nemployee will only \u201cimpose[] peripheral costs on a State. Arizona, 40 F.4th at 386. This is\n\n\n\n                                                 21\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 101         Filed 03/24/25      Page 25 of 32\n\n\n\nespecially true where the allegedly lost \u201cnotice\u201d time, upon which these costs and lost tax revenues\n\nhinge, is 60 days. Moreover, the Court\u2019s analysis would mean everyone who loses money from a\n\nfederal action and lacks a damages claim against the government, (which would be the majority of\n\nclaimants due to the small number of sovereign immunity waivers), would be entitled to\n\nemergency relief. This is not the law. See Texas, 599 U.S. at 674.\n\n       C. The Public Interest Weighs Against a Preliminary Injunction\n\n       Plaintiff States also cannot show that the balances of equities and public interest (which\n\nmerge in cases against the United States) favor them. Plaintiffs argue that it \u201cis plainly in the\n\npublic interest to rescind previously unlawful terminations and prevent further illegal RIFs.\u201d (Br.\n\n17-19). But this presupposes that the terminations of the probationary employees were unlawful,\n\nor that the terminations were RIFs. Plaintiffs erroneously assert that \u201cDefendants\u2019 admit that their\n\nmass terminations of probationary employees were \u2026. [i]n violation of the federal laws and\n\nregulations governing RIFs.\u201d (Br. 20).\n\n       The proposed relief also disserves both the federal government and the taxpayers to require\n\nDefendants to continue employing individuals whose services Defendants determined they no\n\nlonger require. The government will not be able to recover that money if it later prevails at\n\njudgment. Indeed, \u201c[i]n deciding whether to grant a preliminary injunction, the court must also\n\nconsider any irreparable harm that the defendant might suffer from the injunction\u2014harm that\n\nwould not be either cured by the defendant's ultimately prevailing in the trial on the merits or fully\n\ncompensated by the injunction bond. . . .\u201d Scotts Co. v. United Indus. Corp., 315 F.3d 264, 285\n\n(4th Cir. 2002). (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n\n\n\n                                                 22\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 101         Filed 03/24/25      Page 26 of 32\n\n\n\n         Moreover, this lawsuit improperly injects States into the federal employer-employee\n\nrelationship, for the reasons explained above. Implementing the order to date also has been an\n\nextraordinarily burdensome for the affected agencies.\n\nII.     Any Remedy Should Not Include Reinstatement and Should Be Limited to the Plaintiff\n        States that Demonstrate Standing\n\n      A. Plaintiffs Fail to Show that the Court has Equitable Power of Reinstatement.\n\n         Plaintiffs cannot advance their argument by gesturing vaguely to courts\u2019 \u201cequitable\n\npowers.\u201d Br. 10, 18-19. Absent express statutory authority, a federal court may grant only those\n\nequitable remedies that were \u201ctraditionally accorded by courts of equity.\u201d Grupo Mexicano de\n\nDesarollo S.A. v. Alliance Bond Fund, Inc., 527 U.S. 308, 319 (1999). Reinstatement is not a\n\nremedy that was traditionally available at equity. See Sampson v. Muray, 415 U.S. 61, 84 (1974).\n\nAnd while Congress departed from that equitable tradition in the CSRA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1204(a)(2),\n\n7701(g), 7703(b)(1), as discussed above, Plaintiffs cannot proceed under that statute. While\n\nPlaintiffs invoke the remedies available under the APA, that only authorizes a court to grant\n\ninjunctive relief subject to traditional equitable limitations. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702(1).\n\n         Reinstatement exceeds a court\u2019s traditional equitable authority, and so requires specific\n\nstatutory authorization. No statute\u2014and certainly not the APA that forms the basis of this suit\u2014\n\nauthorizes reinstatement to redress downstream harm to the potential beneficiaries of the services\n\ngenerated by a particular employer-employee relationship.           Even where reinstatement of a\n\ngovernment employee is authorized, this Court has recognized that it requires a heightened\n\nshowing in light of the Executive\u2019s traditional \u201clatitude in the dispatch of its own internal affairs,\u201d\n\nSampson, 415 U.S. at 83 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted), a showing that Plaintiffs\n\nhave not come close to satisfying. Thus, the mass remedy sought here far exceeds the scope of the\n\n\n\n\n                                                  23\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 101        Filed 03/24/25      Page 27 of 32\n\n\n\nCourt\u2019s equitable powers, especially in light of the alleged legal violation of the 60-day notice\n\nrequirement.\n\n   B. Any Preliminary Injunction or APA Stay Should Operate Only in the Plaintiff States\n      That Demonstrate Standing and Irreparable Harm\u2014Not Nationwide.\n\n   Any preliminary injunction should operate only in the Plaintiff States that demonstrate\n\nstanding and irreparable harm, not nationwide.       As this Court observed, Judge Rushing\u2019s\n\nconcurrence emphasized the \u201cgrowing concerns over district courts issuing nationwide injunctions\n\nto order redress for those who not sought it.\u201d (Doc. 20, No. 25-1248, at 3-4 (4th Cir. Mar. 21,\n\n2025)). Here, specifically, the alleged legal violation turns on a notice requirement that is both\n\nagency- and geography-specific. Plaintiff States alleged they were injured when they didn\u2019t\n\nreceive the allegedly required notice when defendant agencies terminated probationary employees\n\nwithin their territory. But as Judge Rushing\u2019s concurrence emphasized, as for \u201cthe 31 States that\n\nopted not to join this lawsuit,\u201d there was no allegation or evidence \u201cshowing that there had been\n\nterminations of probationary employe so as to potentially trigger the notice requirement.\u201d See id.\n\nat 5. Her concurrence therefore soundly concluded that the injunction should\u2014at most\u2014\u201credress\n\nnoticed-based injuries only for those States that actually claimed to be injured by the lack of\n\nnotice.\u201d See id. And as explained below, the view expressed in Judge Rushing\u2019s concurrence\n\ncomports with Supreme Court and Fourth Circuit authority.\n\n       The Supreme Court has directed that \u201cjudicial power exists only to redress or other protect\n\nagainst injury to the complaining party.\u201d See Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490 (1975) (emphasis\n\nadded). And the Fourth Circuit, in a published but subsequently vacated opinion, expressed in an\n\nextensive analysis (spanning several pages) various criticisms of nationwide injunctions, and\n\nconcluded those injunctions are \u201care plainly inconsistent with this conception of the judicial role\n\nand the proper scope of the federal courts' remedial power.\u201d CASA de Maryland, Inc. v. Trump,\n\n\n\n                                                24\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB            Document 101         Filed 03/24/25       Page 28 of 32\n\n\n\n971 F.3d 220, 256-263 (4th Cir. 2020), vacated by, reh\u2019g en banc granted, 981 F.3d 311 (4th Cir.\n\n2020); appeal dismissed sub nom., Casa de Md. v. Biden, 2021 U.S. App. LEXIS 7177 (4th Cir.\n\nMar. 11, 2021).\n\n        In those cases where the Fourth Circuit has affirmed a district court\u2019s nationwide\n\ninjunction, the government relied upon a \u201ccategorical policy, which effectively operated as a\n\nban\u201d\u2014and that is not the case here. See In Roe, 947 F.3d at 232; see also HIAS v. Trump, 985 F.3d\n\n309, 326 (4th Cir. 2020) (\u201cA district court may issue a nationwide injunction so long as the court\n\nmolds its decree to meet the exigencies of the particular case.\u201d) (quotation omitted); Cf. Casa, Inc.\n\nv Trump, 2025 U.S. App. LEXIS 4856 (4th Cir. Feb. 28, 2025 (Niemeyer, J., dissenting) (\u201cAs a\n\nmatter of order and equity, it is simply presumptuous and jurisdictionally messy for one district\n\ncourt to issue an injunction that covers the jurisdiction of other district courts and courts of appeals,\n\nwhich are considering the same issues.\u201d) (noting that \u201cthe Supreme Court has demonstrated grave\n\nconcern generally over district courts' issuing national injunctions,\u201d citing Labrador v. Poe ex rel.\n\nPoe, 144 S. Ct. 921, 218 L. Ed. 2d 400 (2024) (mem.)).5\n\n        Finally, respectfully, Plaintiff States should be estopped from asserting new arguments in\n\nfavor of a nationwide injunction. Plaintiffs\u2019 motion failed to articulate satisfactory grounds for the\n\nsought-nationwide injunction, and those arguments are forfeited now. The Court should not allow\n\nPlaintiffs to rehabilitate their preliminary injunction motion with a supplemental brief based on a\n\nFourth Circuit concurring opinion.\n\n\n\n\n5\n  Plaintiffs cite District of Columbia v. United States Dep\u2019t of Agric., 444 F. Supp. 3d 1, 48 (D.D.C.\n2020), which states, \u201cthe APA\u2019s \u00a7 705 must be read to authorize relief from agency action for any\nperson otherwise subject to the action, not just as to plaintiffs.\u201d See Br. p. 19. This just follows\nfrom the court\u2019s view (not at issue here) that \u201cthe APA\u2019s instruction that unlawful agency actions\nbe \u2018set aside\u2019 is ordinarily read as an instruction to vacate, wherever applicable, unlawful agency\nrules.\u201d Id.\n\n                                                   25\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 101         Filed 03/24/25       Page 29 of 32\n\n\n\n        Nor does Plaintiffs\u2019 request for a stay under 5 U.S.C \u00a7 705 authorize the Court to provide\n\nnationwide relief. Section 705 (like other APA provisions) \u201cwas primarily intended to reflect\n\nexisting law,\u201d not \u201cto fashion new rules of intervention for District Courts.\u201d Sampson, 415 U.S. at\n\n68 n.15. The text of \u00a7 705 says that a court \u201cmay issue all necessary and appropriate process to\n\npostpone the effective date of an agency action or to preserve status or rights.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 705. In\n\nother words, (at a minimum) a court has discretion\u2014the use of \u201cmay\u201d does not require entry of\n\nany relief at all, and the \u201cor\u201d offers a court a choice between action to postpone the effective date\n\nor action to preserve status or rights. The text of \u00a7 705 thus puts traditional preliminary injunctions\n\non at least equal footing with stays, making clear that stays, no less than preliminary injunctions,\n\nare a matter for the equitable discretion of the court. There is no basis to interpret \u00a7 705 to jettison\n\nthe normal equitable rules. Section 705 explicitly incorporates traditional equitable principles by\n\nauthorizing temporary relief only \u201cto the extent necessary to prevent irreparable injury\u201d and \u201cto\n\npreserve status or rights pending conclusion of the review proceedings.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 705. That is\n\nparadigmatic equitable relief. The House Report that accompanied the APA thus explained that\n\nthe relief authorized by \u00a7 705 \u201cis equitable\u201d and \u201cwould normally, if not always, be limited to the\n\nparties complaining.\u201d H.R. Rep. No. 791980, at 43 (1946). Grave Article III problems would arise\n\nif \u00a7 705 were interpreted to require or routinely permit district courts to extend relief to nonparties.\n\nThe Supreme Court has emphasized that \u201cplaintiffs must demonstrate standing . . . for each form\n\nof relief that they seek.\u201d Murthy, 603 U.S. at 61 (quotation marks omitted).\n\nIII.   Any Injunctive Relief Should Require the Provision of a Reasonable Bond by the\n       Plaintiff States.\n\n        Finally, to the extent the Court issues any injunctive relief, Defendants respectfully request\n\nthe requirement of a reasonable bond, per Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(c) in light of the financial damages\n\nand other costs that injunction will cost Defendants. As the Fourth Circuit has directed, \u201cIn fixing\n\n\n\n                                                  26\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 101        Filed 03/24/25      Page 30 of 32\n\n\n\nthe amount of an injunction bond, the district court should be guided by the purpose underlying\n\nRule 65(c), which is to provide a mechanism for reimbursing an enjoined party for harm it suffers\n\nas a result of an improvidently issued injunction or restraining order.\u201d Hoechst Diafoil Co. v. Nan\n\nYa Plastics Corp., 174 F.3d 411, 421 n.3 (4th Cir. 1999). The Fourth Circuit continued: \u201cThe\n\namount of the bond, then, ordinarily depends on the gravity of the potential harm to the enjoined\n\nparty.\u201d Id. Specifically:\n\n      The judge usually will fix security in an amount that covers the potential incidental\n      and consequential costs as well as either the losses the unjustly enjoined or restrained\n      party will suffer during the period he is prohibited from engaging in certain activities\n      or the complainant's unjust enrichment caused by his adversary being improperly\n      enjoined or restrained.\n\nId. (quoting 11A Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal Practice & Procedure \u00a7 2954, at 292 (2d ed.\n\n1995)). The Court previously ordered a $100 bond which bears no relation to the costs imposed\n\non Defendants as a result of the TRO. As explained above, the proposed Preliminary Injunction\n\nseeks to require Defendants to continue employing\u2014and paying\u2014thousands of individuals whose\n\nservices Defendants determined they no longer require. Apart from the bond posted under Rule\n\n65(c), the government will not be able to recover that money if it later prevails at judgment.\n\nDefendants strongly believe that they will prevail on the merits in this case because, among other\n\nreasons explained above, RIF notice requirements were not triggered.\n\n                                         CONCLUSION\n\n       For these reasons, this Court should deny Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion for a Section 705 Stay and\n\nPreliminary Injunction.\n\n\n\n\n                                                27\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB   Document 101    Filed 03/24/25    Page 31 of 32\n\n\n\n                              Respectfully submitted,\n\n                              YAAKOV ROTH\n                              Acting Assistant Attorney General\n                              Civil Division\n\n                              ERIC J.

ECF No. 72. Defendants presently do not request any other\n\nmodification to the schedule set forth in that Order and the TRO, but rather ask only for modest\n\nscheduling relief extending the deadline for the updated Status Report from Monday, March 24,\n\n2025 at 1 p.m. EDT to Tuesday, March 25, 2025 at 1 p.m. EDT. Good cause supports this request,\n\nas it will provide relief for coinciding deadlines.\n\n        On March 20, 2025, around 9 p.m. EDT, Plaintiffs filed a Motion for a Section 705 Stay\n\nand Preliminary Injunction (ECF No. 78) (hereinafter, \u201cPI Motion\u201d). Defendants\u2019 deadline to\n\nrespond to the PI Motion is Monday, 4 p.m. EDT, under Local Rule 105.2(b) (where the TRO\n\nprovided that any hearing on a motion for a Preliminary Injunction will occur on Wednesday,\n\nMarch 26, 2025, at 9:30 a.m. EDT). ECF No. 44, \u00b6 7. Presently, that same Monday afternoon,\n\nDefendants are required to file an updated Compliance Status Report by 1 p.m. ECF No. 72, \u00b6 2\n\f        Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 95        Filed 03/21/25      Page 2 of 4\n\n\n\n(requiring that Restrained Defendants file an updated Status Report by Monday, March 24, 2025\n\nat 1 p.m. EDT, apprising the Court of their additional steps toward compliance with the TRO).\n\nDefendants seek to move the updated Compliance Status Report deadline back by 24 hours, to\n\nTuesday, 1 p.m. EDT, which would permit Defendants\u2019 counsel to focus all reasonable efforts on\n\npreparing their opposition to Plaintiffs\u2019 PI Motion, and then shift focus to finalizing their updated\n\nCompliance Status Report.\n\n       The Court\u2019s March 18 Order observed that Defendants\u2019 first Compliance Status Report\n\n(ECF No. 52), which included 18 separate declarations from Restrained Defendants, reflects that\n\nthey have made meaningful progress toward compliance. ECF No. 72, \u00b6 1. The Order therefore\n\nrequired an updated Compliance Status Report apprising the Court of additional steps toward\n\ncompliance, and directed that the updated Status Report shall contain updated declarations, from\n\nthe appropriate personnel from each Restrained Defendant, addressing the reinstatement of\n\nAffected Probationary Employees.\n\n       Since the March 18 Order, undersigned counsel have worked diligently with Restrained\n\nDefendants to update the Compliance Status Report, with the required updated declarations.\n\nUndersigned counsel will continue those efforts unabated, while in the meantime, focusing\n\n(through Saturday and Sunday, March 22 and 23) on preparing a response to the PI Motion.\n\n       Thus, this requested brief extension would enable Defendants\u2019 counsel to obtain updated\n\ndeclarations and ensure that those declarations continue to include accurate, comprehensive, up-\n\nto-date information\u2014while also enabling Defendants\u2019 counsel to attend to their Monday 4:00 p.m.\n\ndeadline to respond to the PI Motion. The extension also should allow time for the Court to review\n\nthe updated Compliance Status Report, once filed, in advance of any hearing on the PI Motion.\n\nSee ECF No. 44. \u00b6 7.\n\n\n\n                                                 2\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 95     Filed 03/21/25     Page 3 of 4\n\n\n\n       Undersigned counsel conferred with counsel for the State of Maryland, who provided their\n\nconsent to this requested extension.\n\n                                           Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                           YAAKOV ROTH\n                                           Acting Assistant Attorney General\n                                           Civil Division\n\n                                           ERIC J.

The government raises serious questions about whether the district court\u2019s\n\n        temporary restraining order is actually an appealable injunction, at least in part. But given\n\n        the timing of the government\u2019s stay motion and the district court\u2019s anticipated ruling on\n\n        preliminary injunctive relief, I agree that denying the motion in this posture is the prudent\n\n        course.\n\n               I write separately to echo the growing concerns over district courts issuing\n\n        nationwide injunctions to order redress for those who have not sought it. The district court\n\n        here required numerous federal agencies to reinstate fired probationary workers across all\n\n        50 States. It ordered relief because Plaintiffs\u2014which are 19 States and the District of\n\n        Columbia\u2014asserted an injury stemming from the federal government\u2019s failure to notify\n\n        the States of its intent to fire probationary employees within their territory. But the district\n\n        court extended its injunction to cover non-plaintiff States because (1) \u201cthe Government\u2019s\n\n        policy is violative of the law across the board,\u201d and (2) it \u201cwould be inequitable\u201d for a\n\n        federal employee\u2019s status to turn on \u201cthe fortuity of their physical location.\u201d State of\n\n        Maryland v. USDA, 1:25-cv-748, slip op. at 48 (D. Md. Mar. 13, 2025).\n\n               Neither reason holds water. As the district court noted, federal law requires an\n\n        agency to notify a State of a reduction in force (RIF) when 50 or more employees in a\n\n        \u201ccompetitive area\u201d\u2014a unit definable by the agency but which must be linked to\n\n        geography\u2014receive separation notices. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 351.803(b), 351.405; see 5 U.S.C.\n\n        \u00a7 3502(d)(3). Plaintiffs identify no allegations or evidence before the district court\n\n                                                       4\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 25-1248    Doc: 20     Filed: 03/21/2025 Pg: 5 of 5\n              Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document 93 Filed 03/21/25                    Page 5 of 5\n\n\n\n\n        showing that 50 or more employees were terminated in competitive areas in non-plaintiff\n\n        States\u2014that is, the 31 States that opted not to join this lawsuit. Accordingly, the court had\n\n        no basis to conclude that the government violated federal law by failing to notify those\n\n        States about any RIFs, and consequently no basis to conclude that the government\u2019s actions\n\n        were illegal \u201cacross the board.\u201d\n\n               Further, the district court lost sight of who the Plaintiffs are and what injury they\n\n        claim when it concluded a nationwide injunction was warranted. The States seek redress\n\n        for their own purported injuries flowing from the lack of notice, not for an injury to their\n\n        citizens. Accordingly, the question is not whether it is inequitable for a federal employee\u2019s\n\n        reinstatement to turn on his State of residence, but rather whether it is inequitable to redress\n\n        notice-based injuries only for those States that actually claim to be injured by the lack of\n\n        notice. Of course not.\n\n\n\n\n                                                       5\n\f",

To the extent this Court rules prior to April 10, Plaintiffs understand that\n\nthe TRO would dissolve upon resolution of the stay and preliminary injunction motion.\n\n       As explained below, there is good cause for this motion. Yesterday, March 20,\n\nPlaintiffs filed their Motion for a Stay and Preliminary Injunction. ECF No. 78.\n\nHowever, without an extension, the TRO will expire on March 27. See ECF No. 44\n\n(docket entry). An extension of time, of no longer than 14 days, will ensure that the\n\nstatus quo is preserved while the Court considers and prepares a ruling on Plaintiffs\u2019\n\nforthcoming motion for a stay and preliminary injunction.\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB        Document 85       Filed 03/21/25    Page 2 of 9\n\n\n\n\n                                      ARGUMENT\n\n       Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(b)(2) provides that a temporary restraining\n\norder expires after 14 days, unless the adverse party consents to an extension, or if the\n\ncourt, \u201cfor good cause, extends it for a like period[.]\u201d In other words, courts may\n\nproperly extend a TRO for an additional 14 days upon a finding of good cause, so long as\n\nthe \u201creasons for an extension\u201d are \u201centered in the record.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 65(b)(2); see\n\nalso Dellinger v. Bessent, No. CV 25-0385 (ABJ), 2025 WL 615122, at *2 (D.D.C. Feb.\n\n26, 2025) (explaining that TROs may be entered for \u201cthe standard fourteen days followed\n\nby a fourteen-day extension\u201d).\n\n       Courts have found good cause for an extension where more time is needed to fully\n\n\u201cconsider the parties\u2019 arguments and motions or \u2018where the moving party need[s]\n\nadditional time to prepare and present its preliminary injunction\u201d motion. See Costa v.\n\nBazron, No. CV 19-3185 (RDM), 2020 WL 2410502, at *2 (D.D.C. May 11, 2020)\n\n(quoting SEC v. Arisebank, No. 18-cv-186, 2018 WL 10419828 at *1 (N.D. Tex. Mar. 9,\n\n2018)). Indeed, courts in this circuit regularly find good cause to extend a TRO to enable\n\na decision on a motion for preliminary injunction. See, e.g., CHGYM LLC v. Unify\n\nAthletics, LLC, No. 1:21CV911, 2022 WL 112208, at *1 (M.D.N.C. Jan. 12, 2022)\n\n(noting that the court \u201cextended the TRO for seven days to allow for the preparation of a\n\nwritten memorandum . . . in support of a preliminary injunction\u201d); Merrill Lynch, Pierce,\n\nFenner & Smith, Inc. v. Sivel, No. CIV. A. MJG-99-185, 1999 WL 35799640, at *1 (D.\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB         Document 85       Filed 03/21/25    Page 3 of 9\n\n\n\n\nMd. Feb. 4, 1999) (explaining that \u201cthe Court extended the TRO until decision is\n\nrendered on the request for preliminary injunction\u201d).\n\n       There is similarly good cause to extend the TRO here. As set forth in the Notice\n\nfiled March 21, 2025, Plaintiffs filed their Motion for a Stay and Preliminary Injunction\n\non March 20, and Defendants will respond no later than March 24, prior to the potential\n\nhearing set for March 26, 2025. Because the TRO will expire the next day, March 27 at\n\n8:00pm, Plaintiffs request that the Court extend the TRO until such time that it rules on\n\nPlaintiffs\u2019 motion for a stay and preliminary injunction, for a period no longer than 14\n\ndays, or until April 10, 2025.\n\n       Otherwise, if the TRO expires during the Court\u2019s consideration of Plaintiffs\u2019\n\nMotion, Defendant agencies will likely re-terminate tens of thousands of probationary\n\nemployees en masse, exacerbating the irreparable harms to the States that justified the\n\nentry of the TRO. See ECF No. 43 at 13-19, 41-42. Such terminations, which this Court\n\nfound were likely unlawful, id. at 40, should not be repeated while preliminary relief is\n\nconsidered. An extension of the TRO will appropriately preserve the status quo during\n\nthe pendency of Plaintiffs\u2019 motion.\n\n       For all these reasons, Plaintiff States respectfully request that the Court extend the\n\nduration of the TRO until such time that it rules on Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion for a Stay and\n\nPreliminary injunction, for a period no longer than 14 days, i.e., April 10, 2025.\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB         Document 85    Filed 03/21/25    Page 4 of 9\n\n\n\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nANTHONY G.

They contain sensitive personal information that the public has no interest in seeing.\n\n                                         LEGAL STANDARD\n\n       \u201cThe right of public access derives from two independent sources: the First Amendment\n\nand the common law.\u201d In re U.S. for an Ord. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Section 2703(D), 707 F.3d\n\n283, 290 (4th Cir. 2013). The common law presumes a right of public access to all judicial records\n\f        Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 80        Filed 03/20/25       Page 2 of 8\n\n\n\nand documents that can be rebutted by competing interests, such as whether the records are sought\n\nfor improper purposes, whether release would enhance the public\u2019s understanding of an important\n\nhistorical event, and whether the public already has access to the information in the records. Id.\n\n(citing In re Knight Publ\u2019g Co., 743 F.2d 231, 235 (4th Cir. 1984)). The First Amendment right of\n\naccess only applies to certain judicial records such as complaints, summary judgment motions and\n\nexhibits, rulings on summary judgment motions, and docket sheets. Courthouse News Service v.\n\nSmith, 126 F.4th 899, 907 (4th Cir. 2025). The First Amendment permits sealing these records\n\nwhen it is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest. Butler v. DirectSAT USA,\n\nLLC, 47 F. Supp. 3d 300, 316 (D. Md. 2014).\n\n                                           ARGUMENT\n\n       The Exhibits are declarations or SF-50\u2019s1 from probationary federal employees whose\n\nemployment has been terminated since January 20, 2025 and other documents containing\n\npersonally identifying information about current or former federal employees. They should be\n\nsealed because they contain sensitive personal information that the common law does not entitle\n\nthe public to see, and the First Amendment right of access does not apply.\n\n       The declarations contain sensitive personal information. They include the declarant\u2019s\n\nannual salary and grade and step levels. They describe the declarant\u2019s formal performance\n\nevaluations and informal feedback on their job performance for employees who were not employed\n\nlong enough to receive a performance evaluation, including direct quotes from emails notifying\n\nthem of the termination of their employment. They also describe declarants\u2019 responses to sudden\n\n\n\n1\n        A federal employee\u2019s SF-50, Notification of Personnel Action documents personnel\nactions that affect the federal employee\u2019s position and pay. They include an employee\u2019s personally\nidentifying information in addition to the personnel action such as SSN, date of birth, position title,\ngrade, step, and salary.\n\n\n                                                  2\n\f        Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 80        Filed 03/20/25      Page 3 of 8\n\n\n\nunemployment, including whether they have applied for unemployment, Medicaid, or other public\n\nbenefits for themselves or their families, and how their daily lives and spending are affected. The\n\nSF-50s also contain personally identifying information such as the employee\u2019s home address,\n\ngrade and step level, and salary. They also contain SSNs and dates of birth, information which\n\ncannot appear on the public docket. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 5.2(a)(1),(2).\n\n        The unredacted declarations should be sealed because the declarants have strong reasons\n\nto keep their sensitive personal information out of public view. See Butler, 47 F. Supp. 3d at 316.\n\nAlthough the recent mass layoffs of federal employees are a matter of public concern, specific and\n\nindividualized information about the employees who have been terminated will not advance the\n\npublic\u2019s understanding of this public issue. See In re Knight Publ'g Co., 743 F.2d at 235 (favoring\n\nsealing if information will not advance public understanding). The public does not already have\n\npersonal information about declarants\u2019 salaries, performance reviews, or their plans to apply for\n\npublic benefits. Id. (also favoring sealing if the information is not already public). The redacted\n\nversions of these exhibits that already appear on the public docket provide sufficient information\n\nto the public. And the declarants have reasonable and specific concerns about reprisal if their\n\ndeclarations are available to the public. Many fear that identifying their names and the specific\n\noffices where they worked could expose them to reprisal. The common law standard plainly\n\njustifies sealing.\n\n        The First Amendment only applies to certain types of judicial records, such as complaints,\n\nsummary judgment motions and exhibits, rulings on summary judgment, and docket sheets.\n\nCourthouse News Service, 126 F.4th at 907. Unredacted employee declarations are not necessary\n\nto allow the public to understand the basis of the Court\u2019s ruling on the merits.\n\n        For these reasons, the Plaintiff States respectfully move to seal Exhibits B, H-L, P and Q.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 3\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB         Document 80     Filed 03/20/25   Page 4 of 8\n\n\n\nMarch 20, 2025                           Respectfully submitted,\n\n\nANTHONY G.

Put\n\nbluntly, Defendants moved fast, and they broke the law. See TRO Hrg. Tr., ECF 48 at 41:4-41:7.\n\n       Specifically, the Office of Personnel Management (\u201cOPM\u201d) directed agencies to conduct\n\nmass terminations of probationary employees, i.e., those who have generally been in their positions\n\nfor less than two years. OPM provided agencies with stock language that cited the employees\u2019\n\nperformance as the reason for their terminations. Following these directives, Defendants used these\n\nboilerplate notices to unlawfully fire nearly 25,000 probationary employees, with many agencies\n\nterminating hundreds or thousands of employees virtually simultaneously, without individualized\n\nassessments, and all without providing any advance notice or warning to Plaintiff States as federal\n\nlaw requires.\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 78-1        Filed 03/20/25      Page 4 of 26\n\n\n\n       Accordingly, Defendants have been engaged in unlawful reductions in force (\u201cRIFs\u201d)\n\naimed at reducing the size of the federal workforce. These RIFs violated federal law, which\n\nagencies must provide 60 days\u2019 advance notice of the RIF to affected employees and\u2014importantly\n\nfor Plaintiff States\u201460 days\u2019 advance notice to states and local governments. See 5 U.S.C.\n\n\u00a7 3502(d)(3)(A) (requiring notice to states when 50 or more employees will be released from\n\nwithin a \u201ccompetitive area\u201d); 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.803(b) (same).\n\n       Recognizing the injuries states would suffer from a lack of notice prior to mass layoffs,\n\nCongress required that where an agency fails to provide notice to affected states in advance of a\n\nRIF, \u201can employee may not be released.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d)(1). States need notice to prepare for\n\nand mitigate the administrative burdens associated with a sharp uptick in federal unemployment\n\nclaims; to plan and budget for the deployment of job transition and social services; and to facilitate\n\nconnections between impacted workers, potential new employers, and partner organizations. By\n\nfiring tens of thousands of civil servants en masse without notice and under false pretenses,\n\nDefendants caused Plaintiff States an informational injury that has impeded their ability to perform\n\nthis essential work and caused other harms.\n\n       Plaintiff States brought suit to end these lawless mass terminations of federal probationary\n\nemployees, and the Court entered a temporary restraining order (\u201cTRO\u201d) rescinding previous\n\nunlawful terminations and enjoining future ones. To prevent further irreparable harm, Plaintiff\n\nStates now move this Court to enter a stay under Administrative Procedures Act (APA) \u00a7 705 and\n\na preliminary injunction that binds all Defendants named in the Complaint. That relief is warranted\n\nfor the reasons described below and in Plaintiffs\u2019 TRO briefs, which Plaintiffs adopt and\n\nincorporate by reference. Accordingly, the Court\u2019s order should: (1) bar Defendants from\n\nterminating any probationary employees without making specific, individualized determinations\n\n\n\n\n                                                  2\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 78-1        Filed 03/20/25      Page 5 of 26\n\n\n\nregarding the inadequacy of the employee\u2019s conduct or performance, (2) reinstate probationary\n\nemployees who were terminated on or after January 20, 2025, as part of mass terminations that did\n\nnot comply with RIF procedures and were not based on individual determinations of conduct or\n\nperformance, and (3) order Defendants to file status reports and information with the Court\n\ndocumenting the actions they have taken to comply with this Court\u2019s orders.\n\n\n                                         BACKGROUND\n\nI.     Defendants\u2019 Unlawful Mass Terminations of Probationary Employees.\n\n       A.      Defendants\u2019 mass terminations of probationary employees are illegal RIFs\n               conducted without notice to affected states.\n\n       The Trump Administration seeks \u201cto dramatically reduce the size of the federal\n\nworkforce.\u201d OPM Email, Ex. A. On January 20, Acting OPM Director Charles Ezell distributed a\n\nmemorandum directing agency heads to \u201cidentify all employees on probationary periods . . . and\n\n[to] send a report to OPM listing all such employees.\u201d Memo. from Charles Ezell, Acting Dir.,\n\nOPM, to Heads & Acting Heads of Dep\u2019ts & Agencies 1 (Jan. 20, 2025), tinyurl.com/y4cjp5wh.\n\nThe memo further directed agency heads to \u201cpromptly determine whether those employees should\n\nbe retained by the agency.\u201d1 Id; see also ECF 52-1 at 3 \u00b6 5.\n\n       On February 13, OPM met with agency heads and ordered the mass termination of\n\nprobationary employees. Chris Megerian et al., Trump administration begins sweeping layoffs with\n\nprobationary workers, warns of larger cuts to come, AP (Feb. 13, 2025), tinyurl.com/mtzwfc6j.\n\nThe next day, OPM reiterated that demand. OPM Email, Ex. A. It ordered agencies to \u201cseparate\n\nprobationary employees . . . not identified as mission critical no later than . . . Monday, 2/17,\u201d and\n\n\n\n\n1\n       Plaintiff States incorporate by reference the factual background set forth in greater detail\nin support of their motion for a temporary restraining order. See ECF 4-1; ECF 19.\n\n\n                                                  3\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 78-1        Filed 03/20/25      Page 6 of 26\n\n\n\nit \u201cattached a template [termination] letter\u201d falsely stating terminations were due to performance.\n\nId. at 1; see, e.g., Bachelder Decl., Ex. B at \u00b6 9; Frassetto Decl., Ex. C \u00b6 22; Evans Decl., Ex. D at\n\n\u00b6 26; DiMartini Decl., ECF 4-37 \u00b6\u00b6 5-10.\n\n       Agencies have heeded OPM\u2019s demand. As Defendants acknowledge in their March 17,\n\n2025 status report, since January 20, 2025, they have terminated at least 25,580 probationary\n\nemployees. Ex. E,2 Summary Chart (summarizing total probationary employee terminations at\n\neach of the 18 Defendants covered by the TRO). Notably, this total does not include probationary\n\nemployee terminations at Defendants National Archives and Records Administration (\u201cNARA\u201d),\n\nOPM, or the Department of Defense (\u201cDoD\u201d), and Defendants continue to seek to terminate\n\nadditional probationary employees.\n\n       Defendants now admit that their mass terminations of probationary employees were not\n\nrelated to individualized assessments of those employees\u2019 performance or qualifications. See, e.g.,\n\nECF 52-1 at 14 (313 probationary employee terminations at Defendant Department of Homeland\n\nSecurity \u201cexcludes probationary employees who were terminated in individualized actions based\n\non their performance\u201d); id. at 18 n.1 (distinguishing 775 probationary employees affected by mass\n\nterminations at Defendant Department of Transportation from two probationary employees who\n\nwere \u201cterminated based on individualized performance-based determinations\u201d); id. at 44\n\n(explaining that out of the 156 probationary employees terminated by Defendant Federal Deposit\n\nInsurance Corporation, only five \u201cwould have otherwise been terminated for individualized\n\nreasons based on performance/conduct\u201d).\n\n       Defendants\u2019 new admissions confirm evidence provided by Plaintiff States, including the\n\nstatement by a former Director of OPM that it is \u201cnot possible . . . for so many federal agencies to\n\n\n2\n       Exhibits A-Q are attached to this Memorandum.\n\n\n                                                  4\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 78-1        Filed 03/20/25      Page 7 of 26\n\n\n\nhave independently and simultaneously decided to terminate large numbers of their workers\u201d or\n\n\u201cto have done proper assessments of all these employees.\u201d See Ex. F, Archuleta Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 12-13;\n\nDiMartini Decl., ECF 4-37 \u00b6\u00b6 15-17 (\u201c[I]t would take weeks or months to evaluate the job\n\nperformance of [thousands of] employees\u201d). Indeed, at one agency, leadership \u201cdiscussed openly\n\nin meetings\u201d that the agency \u201cdid not review or consider actual job performance or conduct\u201d of\n\nany terminated probationary employee. DiMartini Decl., ECF 4-37 \u00b6 16; see also Grant Decl., ECF\n\n4-36 \u00b6 19 (similar as to another agency),\n\n       Many termination letters expressly noted that the individual was being terminated \u201c[p]er\n\nOPM instructions.\u201d Schwarz Decl., Ex. G \u00b6 10; see also Ex. H (SF-50 forms issued to terminated\n\nprobationary employees by several Defendants describing the terminations as related to\n\nadministration priorities rather than individual performance); MD DOL Decl., ECF 4-5 \u00b6\u00b6 61-62\n\n(some agencies confirming that terminations were not for cause but instead due to a \u201creduction in\n\nforce\u201d or a \u201cpermanent lack of work due to change in Presidential Administration\u201d). And all of\n\nDefendants\u2019 human resources officials acknowledge in nearly identical language that their mass\n\nterminations of probationary employees occurred following the direction from OPM.3 See, e.g.,\n\nECF 52-1 at 3 \u00b6 5 (noting OPM memo directing agencies to identify probationary employees and\n\ndetermine whether they should be retained); id. at 6 \u00b6 5 (same); id. at 10 \u00b6 5 (same); id. at 14 \u00b6 5\n\n\n3\n        Notably, only the Department of Interior (DOI) even claims to have \u201creviewed all\nprobationary and trial period appointees\u2019 performance\u201d prior to terminating them en masse. ECF\n52-1 at 28, \u00b6 5. However, not even the agency\u2019s declaration asserts that the over 1,700 employees\nmass-fired from DOI were terminated because of deficient performance. Further, the weight of\nthe evidence suggests that Interior\u2019s process was largely indistinguishable from other agencies.\nSee Ex. H (SF-50 explaining that Interior probationary employee was terminated \u201cPER OPM\n1/20/25\u201d); see also Grant Decl., \u00b6\u00b6 6-19 (explaining that another agency terminated probationary\nemployees en masse despite the determinations by supervisors that the employees were well\nqualified, performing well, and should not be removed from service); ECF 33-5 (redacted\ndeclaration of terminated DOI employee, including termination letter, stating that they \u201cdo not\nmeet the Department\u2019s current needs,\u201d despite receiving a positive performance evaluation).\n\n\n                                                 5\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB         Document 78-1        Filed 03/20/25      Page 8 of 26\n\n\n\n(same); id. at 18 \u00b6 5 (same). Indeed, some Defendants\u2019 correspondence with terminated employees\n\nappeared to acknowledge that their terminations had been RIFs, while other agencies\n\nacknowledged this fact in response to unemployment benefit claims. See Ex. I (email from\n\nDefendant GSA to terminated employee explaining \u201cFor any further correspondence, please direct\n\nyour inquiries to rif@gsa.gov\u201d); MD DOL Decl. ECF 4-5 \u00b6\u00b6 61-62, (noting that several responses\n\nfrom federal agencies stated that employees were \u201claid off due to a reduction in force\u201d).\n\n       The three Defendants that were not covered by the TRO\u2014OPM, NARA, and DoD\u2014have\n\nfollowed this same pattern. They too terminated probationary employees following the boilerplate\n\nlanguage from OPM that generally stated that employees were being terminated because their\n\n\u201cability, knowledge, and skills do not fit the Agency\u2019s current needs, and [their] performance has\n\nnot been adequate to justify further employment at the Agency.\u201d See Redacted OPM Decl., Ex. J.\n\n\u00b6 5 (\u201c[Y]ou have not demonstrated that your further employment at the Agency would be in the\n\npublic interest.\u201d); Redacted NARA Decl., Ex. K \u00b6 5 (\u201c[I]n accordance with the direction to\n\nagencies to reduce budgets, implement a hiring freeze, reorganize and reprioritize our work and\n\nprepare for a reduction in force, we have come to the conclusion that we cannot continue with the\n\ncurrent staffing levels.\u201d); Redacted DoD Decl., Ex.

M at 1. The memo made clear that firing\n\nprobationary employees was part of Defendant DoD\u2019s RIF plan, and the agency did not intend to\n\ngive anyone, including Plaintiff States, statutorily required notice. Id.\n\n       B.      Defendants\u2019 failure to provide notice has hindered Plaintiff States\u2019 ability to\n               respond to the sudden surge in unemployment and demand for public services.\n\n       Many Plaintiff States have recently seen material increases in the number of unemployment\n\nclaims by federal employees compared to the same period last year. See, e.g., MD DOL Decl.,\n\nECF 4-5 \u00b6\u00b6 18, 50, 52 (30-60 claims per day, 330% increase); NJ DOL Decl. ECF 4-12 \u00b6\u00b6 33-34\n\n(273%); CA EDD Decl.

ECF 4-9 \u00b6\u00b6 15-16 (almost the same\n\nnumber of claims filed in the last several weeks as in all of 2024).\n\n       Because Plaintiff States\u2019 departments of labor have received no notice of Defendants\u2019 mass\n\nterminations of probationary employees, Plaintiff States must devote significant resources and\n\nexpense to affirmatively contact various federal agencies, monitor public reporting, and conduct\n\nmass outreach to identify impacted workers. See, e.g., MD DOL Decl., ECF 4-5 \u00b6\u00b6 16, 19-23; NJ\n\nDOL Decl., ECF 4-12 \u00b6\u00b6 17-18; MI MUIA Decl., Ex. N \u00b6\u00b6 8, 23; NM DWS Decl., Ex. O \u00b6\u00b6 17-25.\n\nSome Plaintiff States are also diverting staff from pressing projects to retrain them to provide rapid\n\nresponse services.

N \u00b6\u00b6 26-27.\n\nOthers have created new websites or set up dedicated phone lines to find and assist terminated\n\nemployees. See, e.g., MD DOL Decl., ECF 4-5 \u00b6 29;, IL IDES Decl.

Plaintiff States\u2019 Lawsuit and This Court\u2019s TRO.\n\n       On March 6, 2025, Plaintiff States filed suit in this Court challenging Defendants\u2019 mass\n\nterminations of probationary employees without following RIF procedures, including providing\n\nrequired notice of the RIFs to Plaintiff States. The next day, Plaintiff States filed a motion for a\n\nTRO requesting that the Court (1) restrain Defendants from terminating probationary employees\n\nwithout making individualized determinations based on conduct or performance; (2) reinstate\n\nprobationary employees terminated on or after January 20, 2025, as part of terminations that did\n\nnot comply with RIF procedures and were not based on individual determinations; and (3) order\n\nthe Defendants to file a status report within 48 hours of entry of a TRO, and at regular intervals\n\nthereafter, identifying under seal all probationary employees terminated on or after January 20,\n\n2025, and report all steps taken to comply with a TRO. ECF 4-1.\n\n       On March 13, the Court granted the Plaintiff States\u2019 motion with respect to all but three\n\ndefendants and denied the Defendants\u2019 request for a stay pending appeal.4 Defendants filed a status\n\nreport on March 17, 2025, on their steps to rescind the terminations of affected probationary\n\n\n4\n        The Court excluded OPM, NARA, and DoD because States had not yet provided\ndeclarations attesting to the terminations. The Court noted that its conclusion was without\nprejudice to the presentation of additional evidence in later proceedings. ECF 43 at 39. As\nexplained below, Plaintiff States have now produced such evidence, and respectfully submit that\nany further orders should apply to all Defendants.\n\n\n                                                 8\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 78-1         Filed 03/20/25      Page 11 of 26\n\n\n\n  employees. ECF 52. The Court ordered Defendants to submit an updated status report on or before\n\n  March 24, 2025. ECF 72.\n\n\n                                             ARGUMENT\n\nI.       The Court Should Stay Agency Action Pending Judicial Review and Grant a\n         Preliminary Injunction.\n\n         The Court has already concluded that Plaintiff States satisfy the preliminary injunction\n\n  factors. As this Court explained, \u201c[t]he standard for a temporary restraining order is the same as a\n\n  preliminary injunction.\u201d ECF 43 at 32 (quoting Maages Auditorium v. Prince George's County, 4\n\n  F. Supp. 3d 752, 760 n.1 (D. Md. 2014), aff\u2019d, 681 F. App\u2019x 256 (4th Cir. 2017)). And \u201c[t]he factors\n\n  governing issuance of a preliminary injunction also govern issuance of a \u00a7 705 stay.\u201d Casa de\n\n  Maryland, Inc. v. Wolf, 486 F. Supp. 3d 928, 950 (D. Md. 2020) (quoting D.C. v. USDA, 444 F.\n\n  Supp. 3d 1, 16 (D.D.C. 2020)).\n\n         Both forms of preliminary relief require that a party \u201cestablish that he is likely to succeed\n\n  on the merits, that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, that\n\n  the balance of equities tips in his favor, and that an injunction is in the public interest.\u201d ECF 43 at\n\n  32 (quoting Winter v. Nat. Res. Def Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008)). A court may rely on\n\n  findings it made in granting a TRO and evidence in the TRO record when considering a subsequent\n\n  motion for a preliminary injunction. Arrendadora de Equipo y Maquinaria Especializada S.A. de\n\n  C.V. v. Meukoua, No. CV TDC-24-1203, 2024 WL 4011985, at *1 (D. Md. Aug. 2, 2024). As the\n\n  Court explained in detail in its opinion granting the TRO in this matter, Plaintiffs have met their\n\n  burden of \u201cestablish[ing] all four factors.\u201d ECF 43 at 32.5 Defendants have produced no arguments\n\n\n  5\n          The Court may rely on the TRO record in granting a Preliminary Injunction. Accordingly,\n  Plaintiff States incorporate by reference the briefing and evidence submitted in support of their\n  motion for a temporary restraining order. See ECF 4-1 through ECF 4-39, ECF 51 through 5-19,\n\n\n\n                                                    9\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 78-1        Filed 03/20/25      Page 12 of 26\n\n\n\nor evidence that disturbs this conclusion, and additional evidence gathered since the Parties briefed\n\nthe TRO only strengthens the arguments of Plaintiff States. Plaintiff States are therefore entitled\n\nto preliminary relief during the pendency of the litigation, both pursuant to a preliminary\n\ninjunction, under the Court\u2019s equitable powers, and a stay of the challenged agency actions, under\n\n\u00a7 705 of the APA.\n\n       A.      Plaintiff States are Likely to Prevail on the Merits of Their Claims.\n\n       As the Court correctly found in granting the TRO, Defendants chose to terminate\n\nprobationary employees through a RIF, 5 U.S.C. 3502, but ignored the statutory and regulatory\n\nrequirements governing RIFs. ECF 43 at 2-3. Instead, they issued boilerplate letters claiming\n\nfalsely that probationary employees were being terminated en masse due to performance.\n\n       That justification was plainly pretext. To terminate a probationary employee for\n\nunsatisfactory performance, a federal agency \u201cmust honestly be dissatisfied with the probationer\u2019s\n\nconduct or performance after giving him a fair trial on the job.\u201d McGuffin, 942 F.3d at 1102\n\n(emphasis added) (cleaned up). Here, Defense counsel\u2019s bald assertion that Defendants\u2019\n\nterminations were based on any actual assessment of the affected employees\u2019 performance is belied\n\nby the overwhelming weight of the evidence. TRO Hrg. Tr., ECF 48 at 38:1-21.\n\n       Critically, Defendants\u2019 terminations were not performance based at all. Instead, they were\n\ncoordinated efforts to dismiss large numbers of employees near-simultaneously to reduce and\n\nrestructure the workforce\u2014in other words, they were a RIF. To begin with, OPM\u2019s directive was\n\nto terminate, not evaluate, probationary employees. Frassetto Decl., Ex. C. \u00b6 20. Further,\n\ndeclarations of agency officials explained that individual assessments were not the basis for the\n\n\n\nECF 19, ECF 33-1 through 33-19. To be clear, Plaintiff States adopt all of the arguments made in\nthat prior briefing. The mere fact that an argument is not reiterated here does not indicate an\nintention to abandon it.\n\n\n                                                 10\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB         Document 78-1       Filed 03/20/25     Page 13 of 26\n\n\n\nmass terminations, DiMartini Decl., ECF 4-37 \u00b6 16, and declarations of affected probationary\n\nemployees demonstrate many had received exemplary evaluations shortly before their termination,\n\nsee, e.g., ECF 33-1, 33-2, 33-5, 33-10, 33-11, 33-14, 33-16, 33-17, 33-18, 33-19. In addition,\n\nseveral Defendants admitted to the Maryland Department of Labor that many employees were\n\nterminated due to a \u201creduction in force,\u201d MD DOL Decl., ECF 4-5 \u00b6\u00b6 61-62, and terminated\n\nprobationary employees\u2019 SF-50 Forms described the reasons for their terminations such as\n\n\u201cSEPARATED BY ORDER OF OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT.\u201d Ex. H.\n\nProbationary employees fired from the General Services Administration were even instructed to\n\ndirect questions regarding their separation to RIF@gsa.gov. Ex. I.\n\n       Furthermore, as discussed above, the 18 declarations Defendants submitted in support of\n\ntheir March 17 status report likewise confirm that Defendants\u2019 mass terminations of probationary\n\nemployees were not based on individualized determinations of performance or conduct. See, e.g.,\n\nECF 52-1 at 14 (explaining that the 313 probationary employee terminations reported by\n\nDefendant DHS \u201cexcludes probationary employees who were terminated in individualized actions\n\nbased on their performance\u201d); ECF 52-1 at 18 n.1 (similar for Defendant DOT); ECF 52-1 at 44\n\n(similar for Defendant FDIC).\n\n       Just as the \u201crecord [at the TRO stage] reflect[ed] that these probationary employees were\n\nnot terminated for cause,\u201d newly gathered declarations from terminated probationary employees\n\nwho worked in DoD, NARA, and OPM underscore this conclusion. ECF 43 at 39; Redacted OPM\n\nDecl., Ex. J \u00b6 8; Redacted NARA Decl., Ex. K \u00b6 4; Redacted DoD Decl., Ex. L \u00b6\u00b6 9-11. Indeed,\n\nthese declarations show that many affected employees had received positive performance feedback\n\nand none of them was terminated because the agencies were \u201chonestly [] dissatisfied with the\n\nprobationer\u2019s conduct or performance after giving him a fair trial on the job.\u201d McGuffin v. Soc.\n\n\n\n\n                                               11\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB             Document 78-1         Filed 03/20/25        Page 14 of 26\n\n\n\nSec. Admin., 942 F.3d 1099, 1102 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (emphasis added) (citation and internal\n\nquotation marks omitted); see ECF 43 at 37.\n\n        Even absent this evidence, the Court could see through Defendants\u2019 attempts to obscure\n\nthe facts. \u201cThe sheer number of employees that were terminated in a matter of days belies any\n\nargument that these terminations were due to the employees\u2019 individual unsatisfactory\n\nperformance or conduct.\u201d ECF 43 at 33. As the Court rightly observed, Defendants\u2019 argument that\n\nagencies fired nearly 25,000 probationary employees based on individualized findings of\n\nperformance issues \u201cborders on the frivolous.\u201d ECF 43 at 39. These mass terminations, conducted\n\nwithout any individualized assessment of job performance, and executed instead to reduce the size\n\nof entire agencies and offices, were plainly large-scale RIFs.\n\n        Defendants do not dispute that they are required to provide advance notice to states before\n\nseparating employees as part of a RIF, nor can they. RIFs require advance notice to \u201c[t]he State or\n\nentity designated by the State to carry out rapid response activities.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d)(3)(A); 5\n\nC.F.R. \u00a7 351.803(b). To mitigate the burden on state resources, Congress sought to aid states in\n\nproactively assisting soon-to-be terminated residents. Indeed, the Defendants have conceded as\n\nmuch. TRO Hrg. Tr., ECF 48 at 23-24 (Government Counsel: \u201cI\u2019m not disputing that the purpose\n\n[of the statute] is to allow states to participate in assisting individuals in their states with relocating\n\nemployees, helping them find some sort of a new role.\u201d). And Defendants do not dispute that they\n\nfailed to comply with these clear requirements.\n\n        As the Court correctly concluded, the Defendants\u2019 failure to provide the Plaintiff States\n\nnotice was contrary to statutory requirements in violation of the APA. ECF 43 at 30. Because\n\nDefendants\u2019 legal violations are clear and obvious, they have no likelihood of success on the\n\nmerits. See CASA, Inc. v. Trump, No. 25-1153, 2025 WL 654902, at *1 (4th Cir. Feb. 28, 2025)\n\n\n\n\n                                                    12\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 78-1        Filed 03/20/25       Page 15 of 26\n\n\n\n(finding no likelihood of success on the merits because \u201ccircuit precedent foreclose[d] the\n\ngovernment\u2019s position\u201d).\n\n       Finding it only necessary to identify one claim on which the Plaintiffs are likely to succeed,\n\nthe Court declined to analyze the likelihood of success of Plaintiffs States\u2019 arbitrary and capricious\n\nAPA claim and ultra vires claim. But the same findings that led the Court to conclude that\n\nDefendants acted contrary to law by failing to abide by the RIF statute\u2019s notice requirements\n\nrequire the same outcome as to Plaintiff States\u2019 other claims, as Plaintiff States explained in detail\n\nin support of their motion for the TRO and incorporate here. See ECF 4-1, 28-32.\n\n       Accordingly, Plaintiff States are likely to succeed on the merits, and the Court should grant\n\ntheir motion for a preliminary injunction.\n\n       B.      This Court Has Jurisdiction Over Plaintiff States\u2019 Claims.\n\n       In granting the TRO, this Court rightly found that it has jurisdiction over Plaintiff States\u2019\n\nclaims. ECF 43 at 23.\n\n       First, Plaintiff States have standing to bring these claims. To establish standing, a plaintiff\n\nmust show (1) a \u201cconcrete, particularized, and actual or imminent\u201d injury in fact; (2) that the injury\n\n\u201cwas likely caused by the defendant\u201d; and (3) that the injury \u201cwould likely be redressed by judicial\n\nrelief.\u201d TransUnion, 594 U.S. at 423 (citing Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560-61). As the Court found,\n\nPlaintiff States \u201chave demonstrated each of the fundamental elements of standing, such that they\n\nare entitled to invoke federal jurisdiction over their claims.\u201d ECF 43 at 15.\n\n       As Plaintiff States explained in detail in their memorandum supporting the TRO, ECF 4-1\n\nat 14-15, and supplemental brief, ECF 19 at 2-5, Plaintiff states have standing. Plaintiff States\u2019\n\ncentral injury is an informational injury that has caused other specific harms, including costs from\n\nthe hasty rollout of rapid-response protocols, burdens associated with processing a surge in\n\n\n\n\n                                                 13\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 78-1        Filed 03/20/25      Page 16 of 26\n\n\n\nunemployment claims including time-consuming investigations into benefit eligibility, disruptions\n\nto state programs depending on federal workers, and financial harms from decreased tax revenue6\n\nand increased reliance on state social service programs.7 ECF 43 at 7-11; see also Pls.\u2019 Supp. Br.,\n\nECF 19 at 1-4 (detailing injuries to Plaintiff States). Further, there is no doubt that the Plaintiff\n\nStates\u2019 injuries fall squarely within the \u201czones of interests\u201d protected by the RIF statute, Air\n\nCourier Conference of Am. v. Am. Postal Workers Union AFL-CIO, 498 U.S. 517, 523 (1991),\n\nbecause states are expressly referenced in \u201cthe particular provision[] of law upon which [they] seek\n\nredress,\u201d Taubman Realty Grp. Ltd. P\u2019ship v. Mineta, 320 F.3d 475, 480 (4th Cir. 2003); see 5\n\nU.S.C \u00a7 3502(d)(3)(A) (requiring an agency to notify affected states of a RIF).\n\n       Second, the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (\u201cFSL-MRS\u201d) and the\n\nCivil Service Reform Act of 1978 (\u201cCSRA\u201d) do not preclude federal court jurisdiction. See Pls\u2019\n\nSupp. Br., ECF 19 at 5-8. Under Thunder Basin v. Reich, courts follow a two-step framework in\n\ndetermining whether Congress has divested jurisdiction over agency action. See 510 U.S. 200, 207\n\n\n\n6\n        In particular, the harms to state income tax revenues are actual, imminent, and directly tied\nto Defendants\u2019 unlawful RIFs. Prior to their termination, each Defendant withheld state income\ntaxes from the probationary employees\u2019 pay and paid those funds to Plaintiff States. See, e.g., ECF\n33-1, \u00b6 9 (explaining that Defendant DOT withheld and paid income taxes to the state each pay\nperiod); ECF 33-2, \u00b6 10 (same for HHS); 33-3, \u00b6 12 (same for USAID); Redacted USFS Decl.,\nEx. P, \u00b6 10 (same for USDA). Defendants\u2019 failure to follow RIF procedures therefore necessarily\ncaused a direct harm to Plaintiff States because Defendants immediately ceased paying these\nwithheld income taxes to Plaintiff States upon the termination of probationary employees instead\nof continuing to pay these income taxes during the 60 day notice period. Thus, these harms are\nactual and imminent. Moreover, these harms are directly tied to Defendants\u2019 failure to follow the\nstatutorily required notice procedures. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d)(3)(B). Had Plaintiff States received\nthe RIF notices required by statute, Plaintiff States would have been better prepared to assist\naffected employees seeking alternative employment, which would have mitigated the harms to\nPlaintiff States\u2019 income tax receipts. See ECF 4-35, \u00b6 12; see also Redacted NOAA Decl., Ex. P\n\u00b6\u00b6 5, 8 (explaining that with notice a Maryland taxpayer probationary employee \u201cwould have\nstarted looking for a new position immediately\u201d).\n7\n       Plaintiff States incorporate by reference the standing arguments included in their TRO\nmotion and supplemental brief. ECF 4-1 at 14-15; ECF 19 at 2-5.\n\n\n                                                 14\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB            Document 78-1         Filed 03/20/25       Page 17 of 26\n\n\n\n(1994). First, a court must \u201cask whether Congress\u2019s intent to preclude district-court jurisdiction is\n\nfairly discernible in the statutory scheme.\u201d Bennett v. U.S. Sec. & Exch. Comm\u2019n, 844 F.3d 174,\n\n181 (4th Cir. 2016) (cleaned up). Second, it should ask \u201cwhether plaintiffs\u2019 claims are of the type\n\nCongress intended to be reviewed within this statutory structure.\u201d Id. (cleaned up). At this second\n\nstep, a court should consider three factors: \u201c(1) whether the statutory scheme forecloses all\n\nmeaningful judicial review\u201d; \u201c(2) the extent to which the plaintiff\u2019s claims are wholly collateral to\n\nthe statute\u2019s review provisions\u201d; and \u201c(3) whether agency expertise could be brought to bear on\n\nthe . . . questions presented.\u201d Id. (cleaned up). The first factor is the most important. Id. at 183 n.7.\n\n        As this Court concluded in granting the TRO, ECF 43 at 25-30, application of the Thunder\n\nBasin test confirms that the Court has jurisdiction to adjudicate Plaintiff States\u2019 claims. At step\n\none, the \u201ctext, structure, and purpose\u201d of the CSRA does not display a \u201cfairly discernible\u201d intent\n\nto limit jurisdiction over the States\u2019 claims. See Elgin v. Dep\u2019t of Treasury, 567 U.S. 1, 10 (2012).\n\nThe CSRA\u2019s agency tribunals\u2014the Merit Systems Protection Board (\u201cMSPB\u201d) and the Federal\n\nLabor Relations Authority (\u201cFLRA\u201d)\u2014are available only to employees, labor organizations, and\n\nagencies, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7103(a)(1)-(2); id. \u00a7 7123; id. \u00a7 7703, and not the Plaintiff States. Yet Plaintiff\n\nStates have clear statutory rights to notice. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d). Congress thus could not have\n\nintended to preclude their claims. Otherwise, Plaintiff States would be in the odd position of\n\npossessing a right without a remedy. See Franklin v. Gwinnett Cnty. Pub. Sch., 503 U.S. 60, 66-\n\n67 (1992). The preclusion analysis accordingly ends at Thunder Basin step one with judicial review\n\nbeing available. See, e.g., Koretoff v. Vilsack, 614 F.3d 532, 536 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (examining\n\n\u201cwhether Congress foreclosed review to the class to which the plaintiff belongs\u201d (emphasis added)\n\n(cleaned up)).\n\n\n\n\n                                                   15\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB            Document 78-1         Filed 03/20/25       Page 18 of 26\n\n\n\n        Even if this Court were to proceed to step two, the Court clearly has jurisdiction for all the\n\nreasons this Court explained when it granted the TRO. ECF 43 at 27-30. To find otherwise would\n\nleave Plaintiff States without review and without a remedy because they cannot litigate in the\n\nMSPB or FLRA. Further, the Plaintiff States\u2019 claims about lack of statutorily required notice are\n\n\u201cwholly collateral\u201d to the CSRA\u2019s administrative review scheme, Thunder Basin, 510 U.S. at 212,\n\nbecause state notice has \u201cnothing to do with\u201d the labor-related matters that the MSPB and the\n\nFLRA \u201cregularly adjudicate\u201d between unions, employees, and employers. Axon, 598 U.S. at 193.\n\nFinally, the MSPB and FLRA specialize in individualized adjudications of prototypical employee\n\ndisputes and lack the expertise to handle the Plaintiff States\u2019 claims (i.e., that Defendants are failing\n\nto provide advance notice to states, prior to terminating a swath of the federal workforce in an\n\nattempt to downsize the federal civil service).\n\n        Accordingly, the Court has jurisdiction over Plaintiff States\u2019 claims, and it should grant the\n\nrequested preliminary injunction.\n\n        C.      Plaintiff States Are Suffering Irreparable Injuries.\n\n        Each day that federal probationary workers are left unemployed means rising and likely\n\nunrecoverable administrative costs for Plaintiff States. As the Court found, Plaintiff States suffered\n\nan informational injury and \u201chave incurred substantial follow-on harms as a result of the\n\n[Agencies\u2019] failure to provide the required RIF notice.\u201d ECF 43 at 14. These harms include costs\n\nassociated with diverting personnel for statutorily required rapid response activities, managing a\n\nsurge of unemployment claims and performing administrative investigations, losing federal\n\npersonnel embedded in state offices, and the diversion of various employees\u2019 services. Id. at 15;\n\nsee also ECF No. 4-1 at 24-29 (describing in detail the injuries suffered by Plaintiff states, and\n\nciting declarations in support).\n\n\n\n\n                                                   16\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 78-1         Filed 03/20/25      Page 19 of 26\n\n\n\n       The Court separately identified as \u201csomewhat unsettled\u201d the question of whether\n\nreductions in state tax revenues constituted a sufficient injury. ECF No. 43 at 17. Plaintiff States\n\nrespectfully submit that the evidence provided, such as the declarations from Maryland and the\n\nDistrict of Columbia, support the proposition that sudden federal layoffs will lead directly to lower\n\ntax revenues, such as through income taxes and sales taxes. See supra, at 3 & n.6; see also ECF\n\nNo. 4-1 at 28 (providing estimates of revenue lost). Courts have recognized that a state\u2019s loss of\n\nspecific tax revenue constitutes an injury under Article III. See, e.g., New York v. Yellen, 15 F.4th\n\n569, 577 (2d Cir. 2021) (states\u2019 allegation that a law would lead to specific losses in tax revenue\n\nsufficed to support standing). Plaintiff States have made such a showing here.\n\n       In any event, this Court recognized Plaintiff States\u2019 remaining harms are \u201ctemporal and\n\nimmediate,\u201d ECF 43 at 44, and are integral to Plaintiff States\u2019 ability to meet their legal obligations\n\nto provide rapid response services and to otherwise discharge their responsibilities to their\n\nresidents, id. at 15. That alone suffices to demonstrate standing.\n\n       D.      The Balance Of Equities And The Public Interest Heavily Favor A\n               Preliminary Injunction.\n\n       The balance of equities and the public interest continue to \u201cweigh in favor of granting\u201d\n\nrelief. ECF 43 at 46. The public \u201cundoubtedly has an interest in seeing its governmental institutions\n\nfollow the law.\u201d Roe v. Dep\u2019t of Def., 947 F.3d 207, 230-31 (4th Cir. 2020). (internal quotation\n\nmarks and citation omitted). And \u201cthese mass terminations conducted without appropriate notice\n\nhave placed enormous strain on the States.\u201d ECF 43 at 44. The public, in turn, \u201chas a great interest\n\nin States not unnecessarily diverting resources from other functions.\u201d Id. There is no public interest\n\nin unlawful government action, and the government does not suffer harm from restraint of an\n\nunlawful practice. Sanchez v. McAleenan, No. CV GLR-19-1728, 2024 WL 1256264, at *14 (D.\n\nMd. Mar. 25, 2024) (citing Rodriguez v. Robbins, 715 F.3d 1127, 1145 (9th Cir. 2013)). Nor should\n\n\n\n                                                  17\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 78-1      Filed 03/20/25       Page 20 of 26\n\n\n\nthe Plaintiff States shoulder the administrative burden of locating, supporting, and offering\n\nunemployment benefits to thousands of illegally terminated employees while the Defendants\n\ncontinue their \u201cready, fire, aim\u201d campaign to reduce the federal workforce. Thus, it is plainly in\n\nthe public interest to rescind previous unlawful terminations and prevent further illegal RIFs. See\n\nRoe, 947 F.3d at 371.\n\n II.    The Preliminary Injunction Should Bind All Defendants.\n        In its decision granting the TRO, the Court found that Plaintiff States established likelihood\n\nof success on the merits as to nearly all Defendants, including because of declarations and\n\ntermination notices from terminated probationary employees at each agency. See ECF 43 at 32-\n\n39. While the Court found that Plaintiff States had not met their burden as to Defendants DoD,\n\nNARA, and OPM, it made that determination \u201cwithout prejudice to the presentation of additional\n\nevidence with respect to these three agencies.\u201d ECF 43 at 39. Plaintiff States submit such evidence\n\nin support of this motion, and the Court should enter a preliminary injunction in this matter that\n\nbinds all Defendants. See Ex. J (declaration and termination notice for OPM employee); Ex. K\n\n(declaration and termination notice for NARA employee); Ex. L (declaration and termination\n\nnotice for DoD employee).\n\n        Accordingly, the Court should grant Plaintiff States\u2019 motion and enter a preliminary\n\ninjunction that binds all Defendants.\n\nIII.    The Preliminary Injunction Should Encompass the Full Scope of the\n        Unlawful RIFs, as the TRO Did.\n        This Court should ensure that any order fully covers the agency actions at issue that\n\ndisrupted the status quo ante, just as it did at the TRO stage. Accordingly, this Court should either\n\nstay the unlawful RIFs in full under 5 U.S.C \u00a7 705 or issue a preliminary injunction fully pausing\n\nand rescinding those RIFs through its equitable powers rather than crafting a piecemeal state-by-\n\n\n\n                                                 18\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB              Document 78-1        Filed 03/20/25       Page 21 of 26\n\n\n\nstate remedy. Casa de Maryland, Inc. v. Wolf, 486 F. Supp. 3d 928, 950 (D. Md. 2020), order\n\ndissolved sub nom. Casa de Maryland, Inc. v. Mayorkas, No. 8:20-CV-2118-PX, 2023 WL\n\n3547497 (D. Md. May 18, 2023) (\u201cThe factors governing issuance of a preliminary injunction also\n\ngovern issuance of a \u00a7 705 stay.\u201d). Doing so would preserve the status quo absent Defendants\u2019\n\nunlawful agency action. See Texas v. Biden, 646 F. Supp. 3d 753 (N.D. Tex. 2022) (\u201c[S]taying an\n\nagency action under Section 705 (even after the effective date) restores the same status quo ex\n\nante.\u201d).\n\n           As this Court found, \u201c[u]nder the APA, to prevent irreparable injury, the Court \u2018may issue\n\nall necessary and appropriate process to postpone the effective date of an agency action or to\n\npreserve status or rights pending conclusion of the review proceedings.\u2019\u201d ECF 43 at 51 (quoting 5\n\nU.S.C. \u00a7 705). Put another way, because \u00a7 705 \u201cspeaks in terms of the \u2018agency action,\u2019\u201d it \u201cmust\n\nbe read to authorize relief from agency action for any person otherwise subject to the action, not\n\njust as to plaintiffs.\u201d District of Columbia v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Agric., 444 F. Supp. 3d 1, 48 (D.D.C.\n\n2020) (internal quotations omitted). Here, to prevent the irreparable injury described above, it is\n\nnecessary to stay in full the agency actions that Plaintiff States challenge: Defendants\u2019 mass\n\nterminations of probationary employees, which were unlawful RIFs conducted without notice to\n\nPlaintiff States. Accordingly, the Court should stay actions of all Defendants that constitute an\n\nunlawful RIF and preserve the status quo ante. As explained, this would encompass reinstating the\n\nemployees who were unlawfully terminated.\n\n           In any event, this Court may also rely on its equitable powers to preliminarily enjoin in full\n\nthe challenged agency actions. As this Court correctly recognized, uniform injunctions are\n\nappropriate where necessary \u201cto provide complete relief to the plaintiffs.\u201d CASA, Inc., 2025 WL\n\n654902, at *1; Roe v. Dep\u2019t of Def., 947 F.3d 207, 232 (4th Cir. 2020). In particular, a \u201cpiecemeal\n\n\n\n\n                                                    19\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 78-1        Filed 03/20/25      Page 22 of 26\n\n\n\napproach is not appropriate\u201d where it would undermine plaintiffs\u2019 relief by \u201ccaus[ing] confusion.\u201d\n\nAss\u2019n of Cmty. Cancer Centers v. Azar, 509 F. Supp. 3d 482, 504 (D. Md. 2020). Here, this Court\n\nreasonably concluded that state-by-state relief would be \u201cunworkable\u201d because it \u201cwould\n\nfunctionally create two separate, drastically different regimes with respect to probationary\n\nemployees in each affected agency.\u201d ECF 43 at 48. For this reason as well, a preliminary injunction\n\nof Defendants\u2019 actions should cover the full scope of the unlawful RIFs.\n\n\n                                         CONCLUSION\n\n       Plaintiff States request relief to halt Defendants\u2019 reckless attempts to unlawfully dismantle\n\nthe federal workforce. Defendants admit that their mass terminations of probationary employees\n\nwere not based on performance and were conducted without advance notice to the Plaintiff States,\n\nin violation of the federal laws and regulations governing RIFs. Accordingly, Plaintiff States\u2019\n\nmotion should be granted, and the Court should issue the accompanying proposed stay and\n\npreliminary injunction order.8\n\n\n\n\n8\n        Plaintiff States note that they intend to move the Court to extend the TRO entered in this\nmatter for an additional 14 days or until such time as the Court rules on the present motion.\n\n\n                                                20\n\f    Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 78-1    Filed 03/20/25    Page 23 of 26\n\n\n\nMarch 20, 2025                                Respectfully submitted,\n\n\nANTHONY G.

I am over 18 years of age and competent to give this declaration. This declaration\n\nis based on my personal knowledge, information, and belief.\n\n       2.      I am the president of the Foreign Agricultural Service Employees, Local 3976,\n\nDistrict Council 20, American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, AFL-CIO\n\n(\u201cAFSCME Local 3976\u201d). AFSCME Local 3976 is affiliated with AFSCME District Council 20.\n\nDistrict Council 20, through its constituent local unions like Local 3976, represents federal\n\ncivilian employees in agencies and departments across the federal government. I have served as\n\npresident of Local 3976 since January 2021.\n\n       3.      Before becoming the local union president, I have been employed as an\n\nInternational Trade Specialist for the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s (\u201cUSDA\u201d) Foreign\n\nAgricultural Service in the Foreign Affairs Program. The Foreign Agricultural Service (\u201cFAS\u201d)\n\nis the foreign affairs arm of the USDA. Its primary mission is to open trade in other countries\n\n\n                                                 1\n\fand assist farmers and producers in the United States to export their agricultural products abroad.\n\nIn other words, our agency helps farmers and producers in the U.S. grow and thrive by opening\n\nforeign markets to American agricultural products. I have been employed with the Foreign\n\nAgricultural Service for 31 years.\n\n       4.         AFSCME Local 3976 represents a bargaining unit of approximately 400 civil\n\nservants who work for the Foreign Agricultural Service in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan\n\narea. These employees include International Economists, International Trade Specialists,\n\nNutritionists, Trade Policy Analysts, International Science Advisors, Technical Assistance\n\nSpecialists, International Market Specialists, and others.\n\n       5.         AFSCME Local 3976 represents the interests of the USDA\u2019s Foreign Agricultural\n\nService nonsupervisory civil servants. Our core functions include providing support, guidance,\n\nand resources to bargaining unit employees as their officially recognized exclusive\n\nrepresentative.\n\n       6.         As the exclusive representative for the nonsupervisory Foreign Agricultural\n\nService civil servants, AFSCME Local 3976 enters into collective bargaining negotiations with\n\nthe USDA on a wide variety of terms and conditions of employment and represents bargaining\n\nunit members through the negotiated grievance process.\n\n       7.         AFSCME Local 3976 and the USDA, Foreign Agricultural Service are parties to a\n\ncollective bargaining agreement that memorializes negotiated terms and conditions of\n\nemployment, benefits, rules, a grievance procedure and other procedures of the workplace.\n\n       8.         Early on Friday, February 14, 2025, bargaining unit members who are\n\nprobationary employees began notifying the union by phone, email and text messages that the\n\nUSDA sent these employees emails containing, as an attachment or within the body of the email,\n\n\n\n                                                  2\n\fa letter to each employee terminating their employment, effective February 13, 2025, at 7:00\n\np.m. eastern time. The emails to affected employees were sent to employees late at night on\n\nFebruary 13 between approximately 8:00 p.m. and approximately 2:00 a.m. on February 14. A\n\ntrue and correct copy of an exemplar of one of these notices is attached hereto as Exhibit 1.\n\n       9.      The letter to employees titled \u201cNotification of Termination During Probationary\n\nPeriod\u201d explained to the affected probationary employees that they were being removed from\n\ntheir position during the \u201cprobationary/trial period.\u201d The letter further states that the USDA finds\n\nthat \u201cbased on your performance, further employment at the Agency would be in the public\n\ninterest.\u201d The letter is signed by USDA Chief Human Capital Officer, Myrna Matherly. I have\n\nseen several employees\u2019 termination notices from our bargaining unit, and they were all identical.\n\n       10.     To date, twenty-two (22) Foreign Agricultural Service probationary employees\n\nand AFSCME Local 3976 bargaining-unit members were terminated. However, AFSCME Local\n\n3976 does not currently know the scope of the terminations of probationary employees within its\n\nbargaining unit as the USDA did not provide the union advance notice of the terminations or\n\nprovided the union with a list of all affected probationary employees. The USDA has yet to\n\nrespond to a formal information request from the Union for the list of affected probationary\n\nemployees in the local\u2019s bargaining unit.\n\n       11.     Since the termination letters were sent to affected employees, the union has been\n\nflooded with emails, texts, and phone calls from affected employees and other bargaining unit\n\nmembers who are devastated and are concerned about their livelihoods and the mission of their\n\nagency. Affected employees have contacted the union to seek information, guidance,\n\nexplanations of their rights, and legal advice.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  3\n\f       12.     Affected probationary employees were blindsided by the termination letter and\n\nare desperately trying to figure out how they will pay for their basic needs such as health\n\ninsurance, housing, and childcare. Some of the probationary employees who were terminated had\n\nbarely started their federal careers and are among the lowest paid USDA members in entry level\n\npositions. These bargaining unit members moved to Washington, D.C., one of the most\n\nexpensive cities in the country, to work in the public service and are now left with financial\n\nobligations that they cannot afford due to the job loss.\n\n       13.     Affected employees are devastated and stressed by the negative impact of\n\nterminations on their lives and the lives of their families. Affected employees are looking to their\n\nunion to protect them and to provide information on their benefits, such as the process to\n\ncontinue healthcare coverage or how to apply to unemployment insurance, and their legal rights.\n\nSome of this information should have been provided by the agency, but it has failed to provide\n\nclear guidance on the employee\u2019s loss of benefits and what to do next concerning their separation\n\nfrom federal service. The union has had to research information that in normal circumstances\n\nwould have been provided by the agency concerning the continuation or loss of benefits to\n\nprovide to members and has been forced to seek legal advice and resources from District Council\n\n20 and AFSCME International Union on member\u2019s legal rights.\n\n       14.     The Union continues to respond to a deluge of calls, texts, and email from\n\nbargaining unit members. Members are asking about information on continuation of health\n\nbenefits; how to obtain their personnel documents and forms that are needed to apply for\n\nunemployment insurance and other benefits; the effect of the termination for \u201cperformance\u201d on\n\ntheir eligibility for unemployment insurance or future job prospects; why they are not receiving\n\ninformation and guidance from the agency. The Union is providing almost daily updates by\n\n\n\n                                                  4\n\femails to the entire bargaining unit about what we know and can share about potential legal\n\nactions to challenge the mass terminations and to provide any information and guidance that is\n\nrelevant to their termination or loss of benefits. The Union is also hosting town hall meetings\n\nwith the members to discuss their concerns and share information.\n\n       15.     Since the USDA terminated probationary employees, the Union has had to divert\n\nvirtually all of its time and resources to engage with the membership on this issue and address\n\ntheir concerns. Since the terminations of probationary employees at the Foreign Agricultural\n\nService, I have been spending at least 9 hours per day addressing the termination of probationary\n\nemployees and responding to and assisting affected employees and other bargaining unit\n\nmembers who are concerned about the future of their employment. I have also had to work on\n\nmy days off and on the weekends to talk to affected employees, address their concerns, and\n\ncoordinate with the local\u2019s executive board on the strategy to protect our members. The local\u2019s\n\nvice president and chief steward currently work full-time jobs for the Foreign Agricultural\n\nService. These local officers must use the Union\u2019s limited union \u201cofficial time\u201d bank to work on\n\nthis issue during the workday if their workload permits or work on these issues during their time\n\noff. They have worked several hours each day either on union official time or after hours help\n\nour affected members. This representational work for the Union is only increasing because of the\n\nchaos caused by the mass terminations for all employees in the bargaining unit. Even non-\n\nprobationary employees in the bargaining unit are now terrified of opening their emails to find\n\nthey are immediately terminated and are reaching out to the Union for assurances or guidance\n\nwhich we cannot provide given the agency\u2019s lack of transparency on employee terminations.\n\n       16.     The substantial increase in emails, phone calls, text messages, and requests for\n\ncounseling concerning the termination of probationary employees has diverted resources and\n\n\n\n                                                5\n\ftime that the union dedicates to its mission of advocating and negotiating for improved\n\nworkplace conditions, organizing new members, representing employees, and the administrative\n\ntasks to maintain the union. For example, the entire union executive board and stewards have\n\nhad to drop their non-urgent representational work to research the impact of the terminations and\n\nto counsel employees.\n\n       17.     Affected employees are particularly worried about how the termination letter,\n\nwhich states they were terminated for \u201cperformance\u201d reasons, will impact their future job\n\nprospects. Many affected employees have told the Union that they believe that the terminations\n\nwere not based on inadequate performance because they have received excellent performance\n\nevaluations, awards, or commendations and their performance had never before been questioned.\n\nOne probationary employee who corresponded with the signatory of the termination letter,\n\nMyrna Matherly, questioned the letter\u2019s representation that their termination was based on\n\nperformance and challenged the agency manager to produce any negative performance\n\nevaluation. In this correspondence the employee asked if their good performance evaluations\n\nwere a factor in their termination. Ms. Matherly responded that they were not, and that the\n\nlanguage used in the termination letter was provided by OPM for all terminations of probationary\n\nemployees across the federal government.\n\n       18.     Affected bargaining unit members are living in fear of how they will be able to\n\nfinancially provide for their families and this is affecting their mental and physical health. None\n\nof the affected employees have received their SF-50 form that documents the termination and\n\nallows employees to seek benefits such as unemployment insurance. The USDA has told some\n\naffected employees that they must wait weeks to get the form because they were hired in the\n\n\n\n\n                                                 6\n\fmiddle of a pay period and must wait for the current pay period to end before processing the\n\nforms.\n\n         19.   The termination of probationary employees has affected very talented and\n\ncommitted public sector workers and veterans. The USDA could not possibly justify their\n\ntermination based on inadequate \u201cperformance.\u201d\n\n         20.   One such employee was an International Economist with the Foreign Agricultural\n\nService, hired under the prestigious and highly competitive Presidential Management Fellows\n\n(\u201cPMF\u201d) program. The PMF Program is a leadership development program that recruits and\n\ntrains future government leaders that transition to the federal service after a two-year\n\nprobationary period. This affected employee is also a veteran, having served for five years as a\n\nNavy corpsman assigned to the Marine Corps to provide medic services during two deployments\n\nin Iraq and Southeast Asia. As an International Economist for the Foreign Agricultural Service,\n\nthis employee did analytical work concerning the imposition on tariffs placed on U.S.\n\nagricultural products or work engaged in trade facilitation when U.S. agricultural products are\n\nimpeded from entering a market abroad for various reasons, including retaliatory tariffs. His role\n\nwas to facilitate the trade of U.S. agricultural products in foreign markets that benefited U.S.\n\nfarmers and agricultural product producers. On the morning of February 14, 2025, this employee\n\nreceived the probationary employee email termination notice notifying his that his termination\n\nwas effective the day prior. He was subsequently locked out of all USDA systems and lost access\n\nto his personnel documents, such as past performance evaluations and other personnel\n\ndocuments. This news was devastating to the employee, who had to immediately figure out how\n\nhe would financially provide for his family, including his young son. He thought he was\n\nprotected as a veteran, by his status as a PMF fellow, and by his outstanding performance. He\n\n\n\n                                                 7\n\ffeels betrayed by the government because he went to bat for this country as a soldier serving two\n\noverseas deployments, but the government did not go to bat for him. He stated that if the agency\n\nhad actually done an individualized review of his performance, it would have concluded that his\n\nperformance was exemplary. He is currently having trouble filing for unemployment insurance\n\nbecause he has not received the SF-8 or SF-50 forms from his employer required to file for\n\nunemployment. He must move from his apartment to find more affordable housing and is\n\nthinking of using credit or his retirement savings to cover living expenses while he searches for\n\nanother job. This affected employee is concerned with the mission of the agency to open and\n\ndevelop trade in other countries and assist farmers and producers in the Unites States to export\n\ntheir agricultural products abroad because so many smart and talented people, including other\n\nPMF fellows, who do critical work for the agency were terminated without cause. Without the\n\ndozens of employees who have been terminated that provide very specialized expertise to the\n\nmission of the agency, the Foreign Agricultural Service will have a harder time keeping up with\n\ntrade barriers, leading to missed market opportunities and unchallenged restrictions that put U.S.\n\nfarmers and exporters at a disadvantage. Fewer staff also means weaker relationships between\n\nU.S. farmers and international buyers, slowing export growth and cutting into U.S. farmer\n\nincomes.\n\n       21.     Another probationary employee was terminated with only 23 days left in her\n\nprobationary period. Prior to joining the USDA, this employee worked with small-scale farmers\n\nand policy makers for over 30 years helping to balance natural resources management with\n\neconomic and social objectives. This employee served as a technical expert to hundreds of small\n\nAmerican farms and previously worked for the USDA as a contractor for more than a decade.\n\nThis employee is highly qualified and holds a BSFS in Economics of Development from\n\n\n\n                                                8\n\fGeorgetown University, and an MS in Agroecology from University of Florida. In this final\n\nphase of her career, she decided to rejoin the USDA as a federal employee and bring her\n\nextensive experience to the Foreign Agricultural Service. In her role as Agricultural Science\n\nAdvisor she addressed trade barriers so that U.S. farmers and product makers have access to\n\noverseas markets, and to assist if shipments were stuck at foreign ports. When terminated, she\n\nwas helping a U.S. BBQ sauce maker get an ~$250,000 shipment into the European Union; since\n\nthe EU changed in regulations in November, U.S. exporters have been unable to meet the new\n\nEU requirements. During this time, this employee was also working vigorously to prevent\n\nsignificant trade losses to American farmers resulting from impending regulations in a country\n\nthat is one of our top 10 recipients of agricultural exports. The EU has announced its intent to\n\nalter how shipments are inspected and documented, and if U.S. producers aren\u2019t prepared, the\n\ntrade losses to U.S. dairy, meats/poultry/pork, soybeans, grains, and processed vegetables sectors\n\ncould reach ~$3 billion. When fired, this employee was collaborating with the US Trade\n\nRepresentative and the U.S. Embassy (in-country), analyzing which sectors would be affected\n\nfirst, which would be affected worst, and how to navigate the situation. When this employee\n\nreceived the termination email on February 14, 2025, she immediately called her supervisor, who\n\nwas unaware of the mass terminations of probationary employees. The email stated that the\n\nemployee was being fired for performance despite having a fully successful performance review.\n\nThis employee must now take her highly specialized experience and education that has benefited\n\nU.S. farmers and the public elsewhere.\n\n       22.     The terminations at our agency have been completely haphazard, even affecting\n\nemployees who are not actually probationary. For example, one of our members, who is not a\n\nprobationary employee, notified the Union that the USDA terminated her as a probationary\n\n\n\n                                                 9\n\femployee. This termination has negatively impacted her in many ways, including significant\n\nstress on her physical and mental health, as well as financial hardship. As a single mom, losing\n\nher sole source of income has been devastating. On Friday, February 13th at 8:47pm, she\n\nreceived an email from HR with an attached notice titled \u201cTermination during Probationary\n\nPeriod.\u201d The termination notice stated that \u201c[t]he attached notice of termination is based on your\n\nprobationary status.\u201d The letter incorrectly stated that she was still within her probationary\n\nperiod and falsely stated that her termination was based on \u201cperformance.\u201d In fact, this\n\nemployee\u2019s probationary period had ended nearly a year ago, on March 13, 2024. Moreover, in\n\nthe last two years this employee has received two cash awards for her excellent performance.\n\nAdditionally, in 2023, she received an award for \u201cexpanding U.S. agriculture exports through\n\ntrade supporting initiatives.\u201d The affected employee immediately contacted the USDA\u2019s Human\n\nResources Department (\u201cHR\u201d) and the Union about this egregious mistake. The last message she\n\nreceived from HR was: \u201cWe have reviewed the job announcement and final job offer and found\n\nthat it had been erroneously announced and you were appointed to a competitive service term\n\nappointment instead of the Schedule B, excepted service appointment, as intended. As such, you\n\nwill not be terminated as a probationary employee as required by the new Administration\n\nguidance. However, this notices you that you will be receiving a letter that your term\n\nappointment will not be extended.\u201d As of today, this employee is still unsure of her employment\n\nstatus and living under constant stress and anguish. She has had to nearly deplete her savings so\n\nshe can pay her rent 3 months in advance while she looks for another job, and she must consider\n\nleaving the DC area so she can secure employment before she run out of resources to support\n\nherself and her daughter.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 10\n\f       23.     Members of the USDA FAS bargaining unit pay voluntary membership dues to\n\nthe union, which is the union\u2019s overwhelming source of operational funding. The union\u2019s budget\n\nwill be negatively impacted because of the loss of dues due to the terminations of probationary\n\nemployees, and its bargaining power will be diminished because of the loss of members.\n\n       24.     I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the United States that the\n\nforegoing is true and correct. Executed on March 19, 2025, in Arlington, VA.\n\n\n\n\n                                                     ____/s/ Liliana Caetano Bachelder_______\n                                                     Liliana Caetano Bachelder*\n\n                                                     *A copy of the signature page bearing an\n                                                     original signature is attached hereto.\n\n\n\n\n                                                11\n\f\fExhibit 1\n\f\fyou that the Agency is removing you from your position of                                   with\nthe Agency and the federal civil service effective February 13, 2025, at 7:00 PM Eastern Time.\n\nYou may have a right to file an appeal with the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) on the\nlimited grounds set forth in 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.806.

His primary roles\n   include oversight of the EAR Instrumentation and Facilities Program and several of the\n   division\u2019s mid-scale community facilities, which makes his role mission critical. Dr.\n   Frassetto has been an outstanding program director, and he has taken the lead role in\n   overseeing this important and complicated portfolio for the division. Dr. Frassetto\n   came to NSF with a unique skill set in interdisciplinary scientific research, experience\n   in the oversight of large, complex projects and coordination of field-based logistics.\n   Since joining NSF, he has taken on projects based on his own initiative and further\n   expanded his skill set and completed trainings that have focused on NSF\u2019s new Project\n   Management and Research Infrastructure competencies. He has already demonstrated\n   an outstanding ability to balance the various aspects of his job responsibilities and is\n   highly effective at organizing and completing all his work in an accurate and timely\n   manner.\n   Dr. Frassetto also has excellent oral and written communication skills. He has\n   participated in multiple in-person and virtual engagements with the scientific\n   community to help them navigate the merit review and awards management processes.\n   These engagements have included one-on-one interactions, presentations at meetings,\n   and webinars and he always creates a favorable impression of NSF with the scientific\n   community. In addition, he has started to develop partnerships with other federal\n   agencies and has led several successful virtual meetings aimed at facilitating stronger\n   relationships with our partners. Finally, he has served on cross-division and cross-\n   directorate working groups and has been a key member of the division\u2019s\n   communications team.\n   EAR has a large and diverse portfolio of research resource support, that includes\n   everything from smaller instruments to mid-scale facilities to major research\n   infrastructure projects. Dr. Frassetto\u2019s work on this portfolio has been outstanding and\n   he has brought important experience to the role and has demonstrated highly competent\n   project management and oversight. He is a program director who has needed minimal\n   supervision and eagerly seeks special assignments at higher levels of difficulty. He has\n   been an outstanding contributor to the division, directorate and the agency.\n\fCase 3:25-cv-01780-WHA Document 18-9 Filed 02/23/25 Page 9 of 39\nCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document 78-6 Filed 03/20/25 Page 10 of 40\n\n\n\n\n                  EXHIBIT B\n\f      Case 3:25-cv-01780-WHA           Document 18-9      Filed 02/23/25      Page 10 of 39\n      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 78-6      Filed 03/20/25      Page 11 of 40\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 09:58:35\n\nI haven't know.

There's no one to make the argument to. It is not consistent with\nlaw and regulaVon.\n\n\n\n              10:14:10\n\nWhich law?\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:14:11\n\nAlso, follow legal orders.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:14:19\n\n\n\n                                                   11\n\f     Case 3:25-cv-01780-WHA              Document 18-9          Filed 02/23/25        Page 21 of 39\n     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB              Document 78-6          Filed 03/20/25        Page 22 of 40\n\n\n\nThe union has a quesVon.

I just wanted to state that\nIPAs aren't federal employees.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:14:58\n\nSo they're not subject to the same acVons as federal employees. They're paid through grants.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:15:05\n\nThey're not paid out of appropriated dollars in the same respect.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:15:09\n\nSo that's what I would just say with that. They're not similarly situated. They look similarly situated and I\ncan appreciate that because I'm sure we're working alongside them and I understand that. The same\nargument can be made for contractors and other things.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:15:21\n\nBut IPAs are not federal employees so they can't be probaVoners because they're not feds.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:15:28\n\nSo there was no limited discreVon.

What level of\ndiscreVon was given there being someone that knows that they were designated as mission criVcal but\nsVll being terminated what sort of what sort of\n\n\n\n[               10:22:59\n\nInsight can you o\ufb00er?\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:23:02\n\nMission criVcal determinaVon, \ufb01rst of all, it is excepVonally small number that we're permiWed to have.\nSecond of all, we looked at three things. We asked who was mission criVcal and more than half of people\nwere idenV\ufb01ed as mission criVcal and that was too many. So we looked at three things.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:23:18\n\nWhether you determine mission criVcal how long a federal service you had, understanding that a large\nnumber of probaVoners had a lot of temporary federal service that does not count towards the\nprobaVon, but nevertheless.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:23:33\n\nHonorable service in the federal government. And the third thing we looked at was how close people\nwere to the end of their probaVonary period. There's a combinaVon of those factors were used to\ndetermine.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:23:43\n\nYou just said that you were taking\n\n\n\n                10:23:43\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n[              10:23:53\n\nThe conference room is muted. We can't hear online.\n\n\n\n                                                  19\n\f     Case 3:25-cv-01780-WHA             Document 18-9          Filed 02/23/25       Page 29 of 39\n     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB             Document 78-6          Filed 03/20/25       Page 30 of 40\n\n\n\n\n               10:24:03\n\nI have a quesVon that has been asked a few Vmes, and this is for this group.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:24:07\n\nExcuse me.\n\n\n\n               10:24:08\n\nCan you explain what the Vmeline for the \ufb01nal paycheck is and if there will be any severance?\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:24:14\n\nOkay, so\u2026 I'm pulling up my account. Sorry. Fulling up my calendar now.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:24:19\n\nThere is no severance with this. Because of the years of service and it's a probaVonary trial period\nterminaVon. So there is no service package with this.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:24:28\n\nYou're going to get your last paycheck on Vme. So that would be for most people next Friday. And then\ntwo pay periods from that.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:24:36\n\nYou will get your annual leave lump sum payment. So if you have credit hours.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:24:40\n\nComp Vme. Annual leave, you will get another check with that lump sum payment in it and you will get\nan LES that has that payment amount on there as well.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:24:50\n\nAnd again, we're going to mail everything out so that you can communicate with us.\n\n\n\n                                                    20\n\f     Case 3:25-cv-01780-WHA              Document 18-9         Filed 02/23/25        Page 30 of 39\n     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB              Document 78-6         Filed 03/20/25        Page 31 of 40\n\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:24:53\n\nA_er you're gone. I just heard that.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:25:00\n\nThey wanted to close this session soon. I asked management to please answer the quesVons of my\ncolleagues, I think they deserve that their service and their sacri\ufb01ce. And I would also ask my colleagues\nthat as uh as bad as you feel, ask any quesVon you have to ask, but please\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:25:22\n\nBe polite. I don't \ufb01nd another word to say it.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:25:28\n\nIf you have a quesVon, you can go to the mic.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:25:35\n\nGood here? So I just want to make sure that i understand The leWer that we'll be receiving in a couple\nminutes is does it are we all gedng the same cause for terminaVon is that individual for each person? I\njust want to beWer understand\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:25:56\n\nI understand, obviously. Broader thing is that it's being directed by OPM, but the technicality in the\nleWer, what's the reason? Just as we contemplate resignaVon versus resignaVon versus the leWer.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:26:10\n\nThe cause comes from boilerplate we received from OPM. The cause says that the agency \ufb01nds based on\nyour performance that you have not demonstrated that your further employment at the agency would\nbe in the public interest.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:26:22\n\nThat is the only thing it says. The opVons were performance or conduct. If we made it for conduct, you\nwould not be able to apply for unemployment.\n\n\n\n                                                    21\n\f     Case 3:25-cv-01780-WHA              Document 18-9           Filed 02/23/25        Page 31 of 39\n     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB              Document 78-6           Filed 03/20/25        Page 32 of 40\n\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:26:33\n\nNo. Quickly, can you clarify the BSE situaVon? Bse rotators. They're not included in this.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:26:44\n\nOkay. Unless you were in a trial period or you would have goWen an email. So VSEEs in general are not\nincluded. Yeah, so if many of us are handling stu\ufb00 literally tens of millions of dollars that are in the next\nweek or two we have to hand o\ufb00 to and need to know\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:27:02\n\nAs we hand that o\ufb00, if part of our teams are sVll going to be here as we hand o\ufb00. I mean, literally a panel\nnext week on the point of contact.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:27:11\n\nOutside agreements, MOUs with the Paul G. Allen FoundaVon, the Kavli FoundaVon, tens of millions of\ndollars. I am the person who is the person The rest of the team are rotators.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:27:21\n\nThere's a lot of money at stake. So please, please work with your division leadership in idenVfying who,\nbut as of right now, I understand that situaVon and I think we're going to \ufb01nd that in other places as well.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:27:36\n\nSo please make sure that you're looping in your divisional leadership.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:27:41\n\nAnd I have 80 panelists who are signed up on the inside. In person, in the next three weeks. I know.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:27:50\n\nI know, I understand. And my email is going to go dead at one o'clock and they're going to say, where's\nthat guy?\n\n\n\n\n                                                     22\n\f      Case 3:25-cv-01780-WHA              Document 18-9           Filed 02/23/25          Page 32 of 39\n      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB              Document 78-6           Filed 03/20/25          Page 33 of 40\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:27:55\n\nAnd also they need some help on how to communicate with these people about this, right? Because I\nwon't, I won't go in, won't go and do anything crazy, but do I say to them Hey, things have changed. I\nknow in this that the division leadership should do that, but I have two hours to handle all this stu\ufb00.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:28:14\n\nI appreciate your dedicaVon, the mission. I genuinely do. Please coordinate with your supervisor.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:28:23\n\nHi, could you answer my quesVon about experts? And I'll just repeat it for the bene\ufb01t of folks who are\nonline and apparently the room was muted.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:28:32\n\nSo the quesVon is, you suggested or you said that you were taking this opportunity to terminate experts,\nwhich suggests that it was not a requirement to do so.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:28:44\n\nSo I'd like your explanaVon about the raVonale behind that. Thank you. That is correct.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:28:51\n\nThat the removal of experts was completely at the agency's discreVon.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:28:56\n\nBecause if we're asked to remove probaVoners, then we also need to remove at-will employees.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:29:03\n\nSo it's an issue of fairness in your mind. It's not just an issue of fairness but yes\n\n\n\n                 0:29:15\n\nAll right,        , we have an online quesVon           If you'd like to ask a quesVon.\n\n\n\n\n                                                       23\n\f     Case 3:25-cv-01780-WHA            Document 18-9          Filed 02/23/25      Page 33 of 39\n     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB            Document 78-6          Filed 03/20/25      Page 34 of 40\n\n\n\n\n[             10:29:25\n\nYeah, what is the process? So you said health insurance ends at the end of this pay period on Saturday.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:29:39\n\nI think you went mute on the rest of your quesVon.\n\n\n\n              10:29:44\n\nI don't have any control over the muVng. So I'm going to say for the record that i have received no\nnegaVve feedback about my performance have idenV\ufb01ed no issues with my performance. For that, I'm\nsaving for the record.\n\n\n\n              10:29:59\n\nBut my quesVon is, health insurance you said, ends at the end of the week.\n\n\n\n              10:30:04\n\nYou can extend to 31 days. Is that 31 days from the end of the week? And what is the process for\napplying for the extension?\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:30:12\n\nSo the extension is automaVc and yes, it begins at the end of the week. So from Saturday, you will have a\nfree automaVc 31 day extension of health insurance coverage.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:30:21\n\nYou're welcome.\n\n\n\n              10:30:21\n\nThank you. Also, I do want to say that you'll see a lot of            in this meeVng. That's because I\nshared my link and then it got shared more widely. That's the only way most of the people in this\nmeeVng were able to join in here.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   24\n\f     Case 3:25-cv-01780-WHA              Document 18-9          Filed 02/23/25       Page 34 of 39\n     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB              Document 78-6          Filed 03/20/25       Page 35 of 40\n\n\n\n                10:30:33\n\nI am the real\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:30:39\n\n          online, can you drop the link to the booklet for those that join late and may not have received it\nat \ufb01rst, please?\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:30:48\n\nMay I go? Yes. Can you explain why you haven't negoVated with the administraVon to eliminate the\nmore expensive rotator program so that you could protect those of us that have given up our academic\njobs These people have jobs. You could reduce our force.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:31:06\n\nBy unemploying no one. So have you negoVated that with the administraVon? Have you tried to save\nthose of us that have given up our academic by dismissing those that have not.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:31:19\n\nThere's no negoVaVon, \ufb01rst of all. And second of all, the administraVon has already announced its\nintenVon to signi\ufb01cantly reduce the workforce.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:31:27\n\nIt is only a maWer of Vme. It is not today is not the only workforce reducVon that we will do.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:31:37\n\nBefore you ask your quesVon, we do have someone monitoring Q&As and the Q&A online for you,\n   So if you drop your quesVon in there, she can read that for you out loud. Just wanted to make that\nannouncement for those of you online.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:31:59\n\nAgain, with the sort of more mechanical our Vmesheets, Vme cards.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    25\n\f     Case 3:25-cv-01780-WHA              Document 18-9          Filed 02/23/25       Page 35 of 39\n     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB              Document 78-6          Filed 03/20/25       Page 36 of 40\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:32:04\n\nWe need to get those in by 1. Correct. As long as your supervisor knows your hours for last week.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:32:12\n\nWe will take your Vme cards. Okay.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:32:18\n\nI'm going to ask a mechanical quesVon. I'm going to ask a liWle bit of a personal one. It's not really even a\nquesVon.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:32:25\n\nBut I know no other business that I've ever been associated with where somebody has walked in\nunexpectedly and just been \ufb01red in a maWer of hours.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:32:35\n\nNot in a professional sedng at all. You look around this room, these are people who have dedicated their\nlives either to their profession Similar to ones that you menVoned or you menVoned, excellent.\nSomeone's dedicated 40 years to that Many of the people in this room have done that. They've\ndedicated their lives not only to their academic careers.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:32:56\n\nBut also decided that what they wanted to do was beWer their country. They wanted to work for their\ncountry. And this was the most impacoul way for them to do that.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:33:04\n\nSo they made some sacri\ufb01ces and they le_. And to simply be said.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:33:09\n\nIn a maWer of minutes. Your service no longer maWers regardless of what you may say. It maWers not And\nwe said that you were going to have this opportunity, but we're taking that away from you because of an\nadministraVve\n\n\n\n\n                                                     26\n\f     Case 3:25-cv-01780-WHA             Document 18-9           Filed 02/23/25     Page 36 of 39\n     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB             Document 78-6           Filed 03/20/25     Page 37 of 40\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:33:25\n\nType of mandate.

I have many colleagues at federal agencies across the federal government And\nthere's ways of doing this that gives people at least an understanding to digest this.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:33:49\n\nBefore they go home, and I want you guys all to listen to this, when they go home to their families and\nsay.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:33:54\n\nI've lost my job. My credibility with my peers for no reason.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:34:03\n\nFor a mandate. And I didn't feel like the people that were here to support me In whatever reasons, my\ndirect my divisional director, my associate director, all those people actually supported me i'm here\nBecause I'm looking at waste, fraud, and abuse in some ways, not abuse or anything.\n\n\n\n[E3410 x8539 Conf Room] 10:34:23\n\nBut to help opVmize programs.

I am the former Director of the United States Office of Personnel Management\n\n(OPM). I make this statement based on personal knowledge and if called as a witness could and\n\nwould testify competently thereto.\n\n       2.      I was appointed to the position of OPM Director by the President of the United\n\nStates on November 4, 2013, and I held that position until July of 2015.\n\n       3.      Prior to my appointment as OPM Director, I worked for approximately 20 years\n\nin local and federal government positions. I started my career as an elementary schoolteacher in\n\nDenver, Colorado, and then worked in local Denver government. I later served as the Deputy\n\nChief of Staff and Chief of Staff for the U.S. Department of Transportation, as Senior Advisor at\n\nthe U.S Department of Energy, and as Chief of Staff to the U.S. Secretary of Labor.\n\n       4.      Subsequent to my years of service in the federal government, I have remained\n\nactive in public service and civic affairs, including in my current position as the Co-Founder of\n\nthe Latina Initiative. The mission of the Latina Initiative is to encourage Colorado's Latina\n\nvoters to use their voices and their votes to influence elected leaders and policy makers\n\nthroughout the state. I served as a Trustee of the University of Denver from 2016 to 2021. I\n\n                                                 1\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 78-9         Filed 03/20/25      Page 3 of 6\n\n\n\ncurrently serve as a member of the Board of Trustees of the Rose Community Foundation,\n\nCommissioner of the Denver Urban Renewal Board, and Conservation Colorado. In 2020, I was\n\ninducted into the Colorado Women\u2019s Hall of Fame for my lifelong commitment to public service.\n\n       5.      In my role as OPM Director, I was responsible for overseeing the office that\n\nserves as the Human Resources office for the entire federal government, and as a result, I am\n\nfamiliar with the civil service laws and regulations that govern recruiting, hiring, development\n\nand support for federal workers.\n\n       6.       From my time working at three federal agencies (Transportation, Energy, and\n\nLabor) and as the OPM Director, I am very familiar with the respective roles that federal\n\nexecutive agencies and OPM play with respect to hiring and termination of federal employees,\n\nincluding those employees considered to be probationary under the civil service system.\n\n       7.      Probationary employees are generally those who have worked for the federal\n\ngovernment in their positions for less than two years. These individuals can be quite experienced\n\nin their fields, and they often bring private sector, academic, and other government experience\n\nand talent that the federal government needs. This category of newer hires also includes the\n\nfuture of the federal workforce.\n\n       8.      During my time as OPM Director, the office worked to ensure that federal\n\nagencies were supported in their efforts to recruit and retain talent to serve our country.\n\n       9.      The probationary period plays a critical role in the evaluation and integration of\n\nnew employees. Prior to hiring, probationary employees undergo extensive screening and\n\ninterviews to assess their qualifications for the position. Once hired, the probationary period\n\nitself is designed to allow both the employee and employer to further assess the fit and suitability\n\nfor the role. During this time, evaluations, reviews, and mentoring are integral to the process.\n\nEmployers have a responsibility to conduct periodic assessments of the probationary employee\u2019s\n\nperformance, ensuring a fair evaluation of their capabilities as potential permanent staff. This\n\ncollaborative effort serves to confirm that only the most qualified individuals transition into the\n\npermanent workforce at the conclusion of the probationary period. All of these decisions are\n\n\n                                                  2\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 78-9         Filed 03/20/25     Page 4 of 6\n\n\n\nmade at the agency or office level, where each entity assesses whether the individual\n\nprobationary employee is prepared for transition into a permanent position.\n\n       10.     I have become aware of the incoming Presidential Administration\u2019s actions with\n\nrespect to probationary workers throughout the country from reports in the press regarding mass\n\nterminations throughout the federal agencies. These reports are concerning and disturbing. It is\n\ninconceivable to me that the federal government would endeavor to eliminate the category of\n\nprobationary workers. This is not remotely in the public interest and, in my experience, these\n\nterminations appear to ignore the civil service laws and regulations that I implemented and\n\nenforced.\n\n       11.     In particular, to the extent that OPM was involved in directing federal agencies to\n\nterminate workers, I am not aware of any legal authority for OPM to issue such an order. The\n\nfederal agencies are authorized by Congress to make hiring and firing decisions, within the\n\nconfines of the federal civil service protections. Our role at OPM was to support those agencies\n\nin those decisions, not to make those decisions for them.\n\n       12.     The speed and extent of the terminations by agencies of large numbers of\n\nprobationary workers, in my experience, could only have occurred as a result of a central\n\nmandate. It is simply not possible, in my experience, for so many federal agencies to have\n\nindependently and simultaneously decided to terminate large numbers of their workers. That\n\nwould be unprecedented, and logistically impossible.\n\n       13.     In my experience, and under the laws and regulations that apply to federal\n\nemployment with which I am familiar, any agency that wished to release an individual, including\n\na probationary individual from employment, would conduct an individualized assessment of\n\nperformance. If the news reports are correct about the volume of the terminations, it is not\n\npossible for these agencies to have done proper assessments of all of these employees. Nor is it\n\nplausible that all these employees have performance issues.\n\n\n\n\n                                                3\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 78-9        Filed 03/20/25      Page 5 of 6\n\n\n\n       14.     In my experience, and under the laws and regulations that apply to federal\n\nemployment with which I am familiar, agencies determine whether to propose a reduction in\n\nforce. OPM does not propose reductions in force at agencies. And, any agency that wishes to\n\nconduct such a reduction would need to comply with the regulations governing reductions in\n\nforce, including by providing sufficient advance notice to employees, their representatives, and\n\nstate and local governments that may be affected. This is not an undertaking to be taken lightly\n\nand without planning. Agencies engage in significant advance planning before conducting a\n\nreduction in force, and they must respect the protections given to workers who are permitted to\n\ncompete for other federal jobs rather than lose their seniority, benefits, and compensation.\n\n       15.     I am disheartened to learn that the office that I led with pride, with a mission and\n\ndedication to supporting federal agencies and their employees, has been involved in what appears\n\nto me to be the wholesale mistreatment of federal workers.\n\n       I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the United States that the foregoing is\n\ntrue and correct.\n\n\n\nDate: ______________                                         ___/s/_Katherine Archuleta_____\n                                                             Katherine Archuleta*\n\n                                                             *A copy of the signature page\n                                                             bearing an original signature is\n                                                             attached hereto.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 4\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB   Document 78-9   Filed 03/20/25   Page 6 of 6\n\f",

If you believe this action constitutes a prohibited personnel\npractice, other than discrimination, under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b), including retaliation for protected\nwhistleblowing, you may elect to file either an appeal to MSPB, or request corrective action from OSC, and\nyour election is based on which election you file first. If you are not a supervisor, your election of one of\nthese options precludes the other. If you are a supervisor, the election of remedies does not apply to you,\nand you may pursue all three options. If you believe that this action was taken against you for discriminatory\nreasons, other than marital status or political affiliation, refer to the paragraph immediately below.\n\n        Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC): If you believe this action is based on\ndiscrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, pregnancy, age or disability, you\nmay file a complaint of discrimination. If you elect to file a complaint of discrimination, you may do so by\ncontacting the Office of Resolution Management (ORM) at 1-888-566-3982. Such a complaint will be\nprocessed in accordance with EEOC regulations at 29 C.F.R., Part 1614. Your initial contact with the ORM\noffice must be done within 45 calendar days of the effective date of this action.\n\n       If this action is also appealable to MSPB, such a discrimination complaint may be a \u201cmixed case\ncomplaint,\u201d or if you raise the issue of discrimination in any appeal to MSPB, it may be a \u201cmixed case\nappeal.\u201d You may not initially file both a mixed case complaint and a mixed case appeal on the same matter,\nunless you are a supervisor. If you are not a supervisor, whichever you file first, the MSPB appeal or the\ncomplaint of discrimination, will be considered an election to proceed in that forum and will determine the\nprocedures that will be followed. If you are a supervisor, you may elect both MSPB and EEOC.\n\n         Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB): If you appeal to the MSPB, your appeal may be submitted\nby mail, facsimile, by commercial overnight delivery, by electronic filing the MSPB Appeal Form ( https://e-\nappeal.mspb.gov), or in person at any time after you receive this letter, but not later than 30 calendar days after\nthe separation has been effected, or 30 calendar days after the date of the your receipt of this decision,\nwhichever is later. The address to mail your appeal can be found here: U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board |\nContacts and Locations (https://www.mspb.gov/about/contact.htm). You must submit an original and one copy\nof both your appeal and all attachments. If you do not submit an appeal within the time set by statute,\nregulation, or order of a judge, it will be dismissed as untimely filed unless a good reason for the delay is\nshown. The judge will provide you an opportunity to show why the appeal should not be dismissed as\nuntimely. A copy of the form is available by request if you are unable to access it at the MSPB\nwebsite. Please refer to the MSPB website (www.mspb.gov) for information regarding the appeals process\nand procedures that must be followed. You may be represented by an attorney or other representative of\nyour choice. If you believe this action was taken against you for discriminatory reasons, refer to the\nparagraph on EEOC. If you decide to file an appeal with MSPB, you should notify the Board that the\nagency\u2019s point of contact for this appeal is Ochcofrontoffice@va.gov\n         Office of Special Counsel (OSC): If you elect to request corrective action by the OSC\u2019s Complaints\nExamining Unit (OSC Appeal Form) (https://osc.gov/), your complaint will be limited to a determination as\nto whether the agency took one or more personnel actions against you in violation of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b)\n(prohibited personnel practices). This can include, but is not limited to, claims of reprisal for\nwhistleblowing and/or engaging in protected activity. If you are not a supervisor and you elect to request\ncorrective action with OSC, you will have waived your right to file an appeal with MSPB (if eligible),\nregarding the same matter, except as follows. If you are making a covered claim of retaliation for engaging\nin certain protected activities, or for making protected disclosures and OSC terminates its investigation\nand/or has not timely notified you it will seek corrective action, you may have the right to file an individual\nright of action (IRA) appeal to the MSPB. Such an appeal will be limited to an adjudication of whether you\nproved that your protected activity or disclosure was a contributing factor in the effected action (5 U.S.C. \u00a7\n1214; 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1221). If you are a supervisor, you may pursue remedies from MSPB and OSC\nconcurrently.\n\n                                                     2\n\f             Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document 78-10 Filed 03/20/25 Page 8 of 16\n             If you are not a supervisor, whichever option you may choose to pursue regarding this action (an\n      appeal to the MSPB, a request for corrective action to OSC, or a discrimination complaint), shall be\n      considered an election by you to proceed under that appeal process. However, if you are not a supervisor,\n      you may still concurrently file a corrective action to OSC and a discrimination complaint. If you are a\n      supervisor, you may elect all three remedies concurrently.\n\n             Separating VA employees are required to return their PIV card to their PIV issuing office and their\n      government furnished IT equipment and peripherals to the Office of Information Technology (OIT) for\n      redeployment or disposition.\n\n              GFE Equipment\n              You will immediately take your equipment to the closest VA medical center or 810 Vermont Avenue\n      to turn in your IT equipment. The local OIT staff will collect all assigned government furnished equipment\n      (GFE), including peripherals such as monitors, docking stations, printers, etc.\n\n              Regardless of the original issuing site, all local IT teams will accept returned GFE and will adhere\n      to local procedures for equipment accountability.\n\n              A return receipt for the equipment will be issued to the employee by local IT staff to acknowledge\n      receipt of the employee\u2019s GFE and peripherals.\n              OIT Facility Requirements\n              Return any non-IT equipment, office and/or card keys, and PIV card to local facility.\n              If there is lost equipment a report of survey needs to be completed before you separate.\n\n\n              We appreciate your service to the Agency and wish you the greatest of success in your future\n      endeavors.

Hester //Signed 2/25/2025//\n\nSUBJECT: Direction to Terminate Individuals Serving a Probationary or Trial Period in the Department of\nDefense\n\nACTION: Using the attached Notification of Termination During Probationary Period template, all\nDepartment of Defense (DoD) Components must terminate the employment of all individuals who are\ncurrently serving a probationary or trial period in the DoD, subject to the exceptions listed below, beginning\nFebruary 28, 2025.\n\nREFERENCES:\n\n   1. Acting Director, U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Memorandum, \u201cGuidance on\n      Probationary Periods, Administrative Leave and Details\u201d January 20, 2025\n      https://www.chcoc.gov/content/guidance-probationary-periods-administrative-leave-and-details\n   2. Notification of Termination During Probationary Period Template\n   3. DCPAS Reference Guide for HR Practitioners: Determining Appeal Rights of an Individual Serving\n      a Probationary Period_February 2025\n\nBACKGROUND: Following direction from OPM, reference (1), federal agencies have been thoroughly\nreviewing their rosters to identify individuals serving a probationary or trial period in mission-critical\npositions essential for executing agency functions and fulfilling national priorities. This review aligns with\nthe Administration's directive to streamline the federal workforce and ensure effective resource allocation.\n\nIn accordance with direction from OPM, beginning February 28, 2025, all DoD Components must terminate\nthe employment of all individuals who are currently serving a probationary or trial period. This requirement\nto terminate individuals serving a probationary or trial period does NOT apply to:\n\n           1. individuals whose positions have been designated as mission-critical;\n           2. nonappropriated fund (NAF) employees;\n           3. dual-status technicians;\n           4. political appointees;\n           5. appointments made under the Pathways program, or\n           6. individuals who have opted in to OPM\u2019s Deferred Resignation Program.\n\n\n                                                       1\n\f          Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document 78-10 Filed 03/20/25 Page 13 of 16\n5 U.S.C. 3592(b)(1) prohibits certain involuntary removals of career Senior Executive Service (SES)\nappointees during the 120-day moratorium. Guidance regarding removals of probationary career SES\nmembers is forthcoming.\n\nAs provided by OPM, and for your convenience, a Notification of Termination During Probationary Period\ntemplate is provided in reference (2). Components should insert the appropriate information into this\ntemplate, as noted on the document. Ensure that termination dates comply with all applicable agency\npolicies and Collective Bargaining Agreements (CBAs), prioritizing the expedited process where\nfeasible. Additionally, it is recommended that DoD Components place individuals on administrative leave\nfor a period of three weeks prior to effecting the termination date. This period of time will allow the\nComponents sufficient time to conduct a review of non-exempt probationary and trial period employees to\nensure the termination of affected individuals is conducted based on accurate probationary or trial period\ndata.\n\nPrior to issuing any termination letters, management officials should consult with their local Human\nResources Office to confirm the probationary status of individuals, make appropriate determinations whether\nthe individual meets the definition of employee under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7511 requiring full due process and appeal\nrights, and confirm the individuals respective probationary period end date. To aid Human Resources\nPractitioners in this review, the DCPAS Reference Guide is attached at reference (4)\n\nFor individuals who meet the definition of employee, thus requiring full due process and appeal rights,\ntermination should not be accomplished using reference (2). For these employees, management officials\nshould work with their servicing employee relations practitioner to determine if there is cause for action in\naccordance with procedures established in 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 752.\n\nComponents should elect to deliver termination notices in a manner that allows for delivery in an effective\nand efficient manner, being mindful that notices are not required to be signed or delivered by an individual\u2019s\nimmediate supervisor, nor are they required to be delivered in-person. However, management officials\nshould take action to ensure that the notice is delivered prior to the termination being effected and that the\ndelivery of the notice can be verified. Additionally, management officials should review the letter before\ndelivery to ensure all details are accurate.\n\nIf Components elect to deliver the Notification of Termination During Probationary Period in-person, two\ncopies of the letter should be printed. Both copies of the letter should be date stamped and signed at the time\nof actual delivery. Upon meeting with the individual serving a probationary or trial period, one copy of the\nletter should be provided to the individual and the other copy should be retained for agency files. Consult\nwith the servicing Labor and Employee Relations practitioner to ensure compliance with any procedural\nrequirements of applicable CBAs, such as the requirement to provide the individual multiple copies of the\nletter.\n\nAdditionally, management officials must be cognizant of the anniversary date of the appointment of the\nindividual and the impacts this may have if the anniversary date is imminent (i.e., either the day following\nthe date of termination or prior to the individual\u2019s next scheduled duty day). If the anniversary date is\nimminent, management must ensure that the termination is effected prior to the end of the individual\u2019s\nscheduled tour of duty on the last duty day before the anniversary date of their appointment, specifically\nannotating the time of termination in the letter. In these scenarios, management officials should ensure\ntimecards accurately reflect the hours worked based upon the time of termination.\n\nUpon delivery of the Notification of Termination During Probationary Period to the impacted individual,\nproper follow-on steps should be completed in accordance with organizational out-processing checklists and\nprocedures. Such steps may include, but are not limited to, collecting the individual\u2019s government\n                                                       2\n\f            Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document 78-10 Filed 03/20/25 Page 14 of 16\nequipment, to include the Common Access Card, and terminating their access to government e-mail and\nsystems. If, after termination, any personal effects remain in the workplace that the individual was not able\nto collect prior to their departure, management officials should take appropriate steps to return those items to\nthe individual in accordance with their organizational policies or practices. Additionally, after the\nNotification of Termination During Probationary Period is delivered to each impacted individual, an official\ntermination during probation or trial period personnel action must be processed in the Defense Civilian\nPersonnel Data System (DCPDS).\n\nPOINT OF CONTACT: DCPAS Labor and Employee Relations at: dodhra.mc-alex.dcpas.mbx.hrops-lerd-\ndata-call@mail.mil.\n\n   1.

In addition, OPM has\n      instructed Agencies to consider whether an employee\u2019s performance is in the best interest of\n      the government, in light of the President\u2019s directive to dramatically reduce the size of the\n      federal workforce.\n              Based on the OPM guidance referenced above, the Agency finds, based on your\n      performance, that you have not demonstrated that your further employment at the Agency\n      would be in the public interest.

If you have any questions, please contact\n             labor.relations@nara.gov.\n\n             You may appeal this decision to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) if you allege that this action was based on partisan political reasons or\n             marital status.\n\n             If you elect to appeal to the MSPB, your appeal must be filed no later than 30 days after the effective date of this action, or 30 days after the date you\n             receive this letter, whichever is later. If you do not submit an appeal within the time set by statute, regulation, or order of the judge, your appeal will be\n             dismissed as untimely unless a good reason for the delay is shown. MSPB's regulations may be found at www.mspb.gov. An appeal may be prepared\n             and filed electronically at http://e-appeal.mspb.gov. The MSPB strongly encourages electronic filing to reduce delays caused by their increased\n             telework posture.\n\n             Alternatively, while it is not recommended, you may choose to submit your MSPB appeal using the attached MSPB Form 185. Mail the hard copy to\n             the appropriate MSPB office based on your location, which can be found at the following website:\n\n             Merit Systems Protection Board\n\n             https://www.mspb.gov/about/contact.htm\n\n             If you have prior military service and believe this action was based on discrimination for that service, you may file a complaint with the Department of\n             Labor or file an appeal directly with the MSPB. If you first file an appeal with the Department of Labor, you may not file an appeal with the MSPB until\n             the Department of Labor notifies you that it was unable to resolve the complaint.\n\n             If you allege the action taken against you was based in whole or in part on discrimination because of race, color, religion, sex, age (over 40), national\n             origin, or disability, you may appeal the discrimination allegation with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). To begin this process,\n             you must contact a counselor at (301) 837-0939 in NARA\u2019s Office of Equal Employment Opportunity (NEEO) within 45 calendar days of the effective\n             date of this action. Failure to contact an EEO counselor within the 45-calendar day timeframe may result in the dismissal of your appeal.\n\n             You may seek corrective action by the Office of Special Counsel (OSC) at www.osc.gov. Your appeal will be limited to a determination as to whether\n             the agency took one or more covered personnel actions against you in retaliation for making one or more protected whistleblowing disclosures, which\n             constitutes a prohibited personnel practice in accordance with Title 5 United States Code (USC) 2302(b). If OSC dismisses your claim, you may file\n\nhttps //mail google com/mail/u/0/?ik 02bc0839d1&view pt&search all&permmsgid msg f 1824427290096377491&simpl msg f 1824427290096377491                                             2/3\n\f3/19/25, 3:58 PM                                                  Gmail - Fwd: POTTS, RANDALL ROBERTS - Notification of Termination During Probationary Period\n                                            Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB                   Document 78-14               Filed 03/20/25           Page 8 of 8\n             an individual right of action (IRA) appeal to MSPB, but MSPB will only adjudicate whether you proved that your protected disclosure was a\n             contributing factor in the effected action.\n\n             Whichever is filed first, an appeal to the MSPB, or a discrimination complaint, shall be considered an election by you to proceed under that appeal\n             process.

My name is                  , and I am an adult resident of Bethesda, Maryland.\n\n       2.      I began working for the Department of Defense (Defense) as a                at the\n\n                                                                 which is overseen by the Defense\n\nHealth Agency, on February 10, 2025. My duty station was Bethesda, Maryland.\n\n       3.      From the date of my hire, Defense classified me as a probationary employee. My\n\nprobationary period was one year, or until approximately February 10, 2026.\n\n       4.      On March 5, 2025, I received by email a notice signed by Stephen L. Ferrara that\n\nDefense was terminating my employment effective March 26, 2025. See Exhibit 1.\n\n       5.      The notice cites guidance from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM),\n\nincluding that \u201cOPM has instructed Agencies to consider whether an employee\u2019s performance is\n\nin the best interest of the government, in light of the President\u2019s directive to dramatically reduce\n\nthe size of the federal workforce.\u201d\n\n                                                  1\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB   Document 78-15   Filed 03/20/25   Page 2 of 14\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 78-15         Filed 03/20/25        Page 3 of 14\n\n\n\nAlthough DHA cited that                     did not \u2018demonstrate that [her] further employment with\n\n      would be in the public interest\u2019; my experience as the                   was precisely counter\n\nto DHA\u2019s findings.                  consistently demonstrated initiative, a strong work ethic, and a\n\ncommitment to excellence which would benefit our             ,                and the Department\n\nof Defense. Her achievements are quite remarkable, particularly in light of her short time with\n\nthe     .\u201d\n\n       11.     Also on March 6, 2025,         emailed me a letter of recommendation. See Exhibit\n\n3.     wrote, \u201cMy assessment is that                   demonstrated fully successful performance\n\nin all elements of the job. Neither I nor              initiated the termination of\n\nemployment. The decision to terminate                       employment was not based on any\n\nassessment conducted by myself nor by                  .\u201d\n\n       12.     I am now on administrative leave and will be unemployed effective March 26,\n\n2025. I am actively searching for new employment. If I am unable to find new employment, I\n\nwill consider applying for unemployment insurance benefits with the Maryland government, if I\n\nam eligible.\n\n       13.     I can no longer afford to support the local economy in the same way. I have cut\n\nmy spending to the bare minimum. For example, I can no longer afford to dine at restaurants or\n\nto shop at local businesses.\n\n       14.     I pay income taxes to the government of Maryland. Each pay period, Defense\n\nwithheld and paid income taxes from my paycheck to the Maryland government.\n\n       15.

I am a resident of the State of New Mexico. I am over the age of 18 and have\n\npersonal knowledge of all the facts stated herein, except as to those matters stated upon\n\ninformation and belief; as to those matters, I believe them to be true. If called as a witness, I\n\ncould and would testify competently to the matters set forth below.\n\n       2.      I am currently employed by the New Mexico Department of Workforce Solutions\n\nas the Cabinet Secretary. I have been in this position since August 15, 2022.\n\n       3.      As Cabinet Secretary, I am the chief executive of the Department of Workforce\n\nSolutions, and ultimately oversee all divisions, including federal contracts, federal-state\n\nprograms, and federal funding.\n\n       4.      The Department administers a wide range of federally funded workforce and\n\ntraining programs, including but not limited to those authorized by the Workforce Innovation and\n\n\n\n                                                  1\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 78-18        Filed 03/20/25     Page 3 of 11\n\n\n\nOpportunity Act (WIOA), that are vital to New Mexico\u2019s economic stability and workforce\n\ndevelopment.\n\n       5.      The Department of Workforce Solutions also is responsible for the\n\nUnemployment Insurance program, employment services, and labor market information.\n\n       6.      As Cabinet Secretary, I have access to comprehensive reports and financial\n\nrecords that detail the state of New Mexico\u2019s labor market, including claims for unemployment\n\nbenefits, and the allocation and distribution of federal funding received by the Department of\n\nWorkforce Solutions.\n\n       7.      The ongoing mass layoff of federal workers is irreparably harming New Mexico\n\nin several ways.\n\nEmployment Services Expenditures\n\n       8.      The Department of Workforce Solutions oversees Rapid Response, a coordinated,\n\nmultiple-partner strategy to provide immediate assistance to New Mexicans subject to mass\n\nlayoffs. Rapid Response is the state entity responsible for conducting outreach and providing\n\nunemployment services required by the federal Workforce Investment Act of 1998, as amended\n\nby the federal Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act of 2014. Specifically, a state rapid\n\nresponse program is required by both the federal Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act 29\n\nU.S.C. \u00a7 3174(A)(2)(i).\n\n       9.      The Department of Workforce Solutions also oversees WIOA Title III (Wagner-\n\nPeyser) and the Reemployment Services and Eligibility Assessments (RESEA), both of which\n\nfocus on career counseling and job placement.\n\n       10.     The Department works in close partnership with other stakeholders, such as the\n\n25 America\u2019s Job Centers across New Mexico, which provide localized assistance to both\n\n\n\n                                                2\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 78-18         Filed 03/20/25      Page 4 of 11\n\n\n\nemployers and employees across the state in both employment services and unemployment\n\ninsurance claims.\n\n        11.    The purpose of Rapid Response, Title III, and RESEA is to reduce reliance on\n\npublic benefit systems such as unemployment insurance; to promote economic recovery and\n\nvitality by developing an ongoing, comprehensive approach to identify, plan for, and respond to\n\nlayoffs and dislocations; and to prevent or minimize the impact of mass layoffs on workers,\n\nbusinesses, and communities.\n\n        12.    When notified of a forthcoming mass layoff, the Rapid Response team will\n\nquickly provide informational resources and reemployment services for workers, including but\n\nnot limited to: information and support for filing Unemployment Insurance (UI) claims,\n\ninformation on the impacts of layoffs on health coverage or other benefits, information on and\n\nreferral to career services, reemployment-focused workshops and services, and occupational\n\ntraining.\n\n        13.    In addition, the Rapid Response team will contact affected businesses to collect,\n\nverify, and distribute information regarding Rapid Response activities, it will coordinate with\n\nstate staff and local workforce area staff at the America\u2019s Job Centers in the affected area to\n\nprovide support for the affected workers. The Division of Unemployment Insurance will\n\nmobilize to streamline and expedite the processing of unemployment claims, Title III will initiate\n\njob fairs and rapid hiring protocols, and the RESEA program will identify claimants at risk of\n\nexhausting their unemployment benefits for additional services.\n\n        14.    The Rapid Response, Title III and RESEA teams also facilitate connections to\n\npartner agencies and organizations to ensure their ability to provide assistance to terminated\n\nworkers and their families, such as home heating assistance, food resources, and child care.\n\n\n\n                                                 3\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 78-18         Filed 03/20/25       Page 5 of 11\n\n\n\n        15.     Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d)(3)(A)(i), the federal Government is required to\n\nnotify New Mexico, or \u201cthe State or entity designated by the State to carry out rapid response\n\nactivities under section 134(a)(2)(A) of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998\u201d of a plan for a\n\nreduction-in-force (RIF) of federal employees, generally at least 60 days in advance of any\n\nproposed RIF.\n\n        16.     The notices required by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d)(3)(A) are intended to trigger Rapid\n\nResponse activities since it is explicitly to be given to the state entity required to carry out Rapid\n\nResponse activities.\n\n        17.     Upon information and belief, neither the New Mexico Department of Workforce\n\nSolutions nor any other entity in the New Mexico State Government have received notice of a\n\nfederal reduction in force at any federal agency.\n\n        18.     Yet, as detailed more below, the Department of Workforce Solutions has already\n\nreceived 195 claims by ex-federal employees for unemployment benefits since February 2, 2025.\n\n        19.     Because our Rapid Response team received no notice of federal reductions in\n\nforce, the Department has been required to dedicate more staff, resources, and expenditures to\n\nfulfill our statutory mission.\n\n        20.     Because the Department has not received advance notice of which agencies are\n\nplanning to conduct mass layoffs, we have been forced to rely on public reporting and word-of-\n\nmouth to conduct after-the-fact outreach to potentially affected workers. Reacting after a layoff\n\nis far more resource-intensive than the advance planning and assistance process required by law.\n\n        21.     Moreover, the Department of Workforce Solutions has had to devote significant\n\nadditional staff time from communications and policy staff to conduct broad-based outreach to\n\ntry and identify recently terminated employees, and provide relevant resources and services.\n\n\n\n                                                    4\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 78-18         Filed 03/20/25     Page 6 of 11\n\n\n\n       22.     Under normal circumstances, such personnel are engaged in general media\n\nstrategy around connecting New Mexicans to jobs, providing round-the-clock support for New\n\nMexico\u2019s 60-day legislative session, growing apprenticeship programs, and other affirmative\n\nefforts to help grow and support New Mexico\u2019s job market.\n\n       23.     Such staff have instead been dedicated to reacting to the latest layoff news, trying\n\nto identify affected federal agency and ex-employees, provide information, and otherwise adjust\n\nprocedures and resources to assist confused and unemployed New Mexicans in a complicated\n\nand rapidly evolving environment.\n\n       24.     The New Mexico Department of Workforce Solutions has expended over $23,000\n\nin personnel and operational costs between February 2, 2025, and March 10, 2025, to address\n\nthese extraordinary circumstances. In addition, the New Mexico Department of Tourism\n\nexpended $25,000 to assist in outreach to displaced federal workers.\n\n       25.     In sum, my office and the State are devoting significant time, resources and\n\nexpense, simply to identify workers subject to federal mass layoffs, conduct mass outreach, and\n\notherwise make resources available to potentially affected individuals in new ways, all because\n\nfederal agencies have failed to provide the legally required notice of mass layoffs.\n\nUnemployment Assistance Process\n\n       26.     The Department of Workforce Solutions manages claims for unemployment\n\nbenefits in New Mexico.\n\n       27.     New Mexico Unemployment Compensation benefits, created under the Social\n\nSecurity Act of 1935, provide for unemployment benefits for up to 26 weeks to individuals who\n\nfind themselves unemployed through no fault of their own. \u00a7 51-1-3, NMSA 1978.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 5\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 78-18         Filed 03/20/25     Page 7 of 11\n\n\n\n       28.     As a general matter, the federal Government is required to reimburse New\n\nMexico for unemployment benefits provided to former federal employees. Specifically, New\n\nMexico is party to an agreement with the United States Secretary of Labor, wherein the Secretary\n\nshall pay, as an agent of the United States, Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees\n\n(\u201cUCFE\u201d) pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8502(a).\n\n       29.     Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8502(b), New Mexico is reimbursed for UCFE payments\n\nto federal employees in the same amount, on the same terms, and subject to the same conditions\n\nwhich would be payable to them under New Mexico Unemployment Compensation Law.\n\n       30.     The New Mexico Department of Workforce Solutions administers its federal-state\n\ncooperative unemployment insurance program, financed in large part by grants from the federal\n\ngovernment pursuant to the Social Security Act. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 501-503.\n\n       31.     Pursuant to \u00a7 51-1-8, NMSA 1978, an individual in New Mexico who wishes to\n\ncollect unemployment insurance benefits must file a claim in accordance with regulations\n\nadopted by the New Mexico Department of Workforce Solutions.\n\n       32.     Claimants file initial claims online using the Department\u2019s system, via telephone,\n\nor in person, to provide information to indicate the basis of the claim, the name of the claimant\u2019s\n\nprevious employer, the reason for their separation, and other relevant information. \u00a7 51-1-5,\n\nNMSA 1978; NMAC 11.3.300.301 and 11.3.300.308.\n\n       33.     After an individual has filed an initial claim, DWS sends a fact-finding\n\nquestionnaire to the employer to verify the information provided and allow opportunity for\n\nresponse to the information provided in the claim. Employers have 10 days to respond. If an\n\nemployer does not submit a timely response, DWS makes a determination based on the\n\ninformation available at the time. NMAC 11.3.300.308 NMAC.\n\n\n\n                                                 6\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 78-18        Filed 03/20/25      Page 8 of 11\n\n\n\n       34.     Eligibility for unemployment benefits is determined based on criteria such the\n\ncircumstances of the separation from employment, whether sufficient wages have been earned in\n\nthe base period, and whether the claimant is able to work, available for work and actively\n\nseeking work. \u00a7\u00a7 51-1-4 through 51-1-8, NMSA 1978.\n\n       35.      After a claim is filed, DWS reviews the information provided by the claimant\n\nand the employer through the fact-finding process and issues an eligibility determination. A\n\nnon-monetary determination is made as to whether a claimant is qualified to receive benefits\n\nbased on their separation from employment. If the claimant is eligible for benefits, a monetary\n\ndetermination is made, based on the wages earned in the base period, to ascertain the weekly\n\nbenefit amount the claimant will be eligible to receive. \u00a7 51-1-8, NMSA 1978.\n\n       36.     An interested party may file an appeal of any determination issued by the\n\nDepartment by submitting a written request via mail, email, or their online unemployment\n\naccount. Unless an appeal is filed within 15 days of the determination, the original decision is\n\ndeemed to be the final decision of the department. If an appeal is timely filed, a telephonic\n\nappeal hearing is scheduled before an Administrative Law Judge, at which the parties can present\n\nevidence, witnesses, and testimony for a review. \u00a7 51-1-8, NMSA 1978, and NMAC 11.3.500.\n\nUnemployment Benefits Recent Experience and Investigatory Process\n\n       37.     The Department\u2019s latest data indicates that 195 former federal employees have\n\napplied for unemployment benefits since February 2, 2025.\n\n       38.     The primary geographic locations of unemployment claims from federal\n\nemployees are Albuquerque, Rio Rancho, Carlsbad, Santa Fe, and Las Cruces.\n\n       39.     The federal agencies that claimants have reported most frequently as their\n\nemployer are the US Department of Agriculture, the US Department of Interior \u2013 National Park\n\n\n\n                                                 7\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 78-18          Filed 03/20/25     Page 9 of 11\n\n\n\nService, and the US Department of Interior \u2013 Bureau of Indian Affairs. In total, claimants have\n\nfiled claims naming 17 federal agencies as their employer.\n\n       40.     As stated above, when an employer provides the initial report of separation to the\n\nDepartment, the employer must indicate the reason for the separation.\n\n       41.     Upon information and belief, federal workers\u2019 termination notices have included\n\nstatements suggesting that they were fired for poor performance.\n\n       42.     The Department of Workforce Solution\u2019s procedures require that the claims\n\nadjudicator must investigate the reason for discharge.\n\n       43.     Under \u00a7 51-1-7(A)(2), NMSA 1978, the standard for disqualification of a\n\nclaimant is not whether they were fired \u201cfor cause\u201d or for poor performance, but rather, whether\n\n\u201cthe individual has been discharged for misconduct connected with the individual's\n\nemployment.\u201d \u201cTo be disqualifying, misconduct must evince a willful or wanton disregard for\n\nthe employer's interests and must significantly infringe upon legitimate employer expectations.\u201d\n\nOtero v. New Mexico Emp't Sec. Div., 1990-NMSC-007, 109 N.M. 412, 785 P.2d 1031.\n\nEmployees must receive adequate warnings prior to discharge. Chavez v. Employment Sec.\n\nComm'n, 1982-NMSC-077, 98 N.M. 462, 649 P.2d 1375.\n\n       44.     On February 11, 2025, President Trump issued Executive Order 14222, stating,\n\n\u201cAgency Heads shall promptly undertake preparations to initiate large-scale reductions in force\n\n(RIFs).\u201d In addition, numerous other statements of the President and other federal officials\n\nsuggest that the majority of recent federal terminations were not due to employee misconduct,\n\nbut instead constitute a government-wide effort to shrink the size of the federal workforce.\n\n       45.     Upon information and belief, the Department of Workforce Solutions anticipates\n\nthat given the consistency of the termination letters across agencies, at least some federal\n\n\n\n                                                 8\n\f    Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 78-18         Filed 03/20/25      Page 10 of 11\n\n\n\nagencies will assert that the terminated probationary employees were fired for cause and are\n\naccordingly ineligible for unemployment benefits.\n\n       46.     To the extent that the Department determines that recently terminated federal\n\nemployees were not terminated for misconduct, they will be eligible for state unemployment\n\nbenefits. In any appeal of unemployment benefits, pursuant to the New Mexico Unemployment\n\nInsurance Employer Handbook, the employer carries the burden of proof in establishing the\n\nseparation was for reasons other than a layoff due to lack of work and in establishing the\n\nseparation was for misconduct.\n\n       47.     To the extent the federal government files timely appeals of federal workers\u2019\n\nclaims, the Department of Workforce Solutions is required to and will follow an intensive\n\ninvestigative process. Because they are designed to ensure fairness, the procedures impose a\n\nsignificant strain on the Department\u2019s financial and temporal resources. Each case demanding a\n\nfact-finding proceeding necessitates extensive staff hours for scheduling, conducting interviews,\n\nreviewing evidence, and drafting detailed decisions. The need to send notices, accommodate\n\nwitness testimony, and facilitate cross-examination further escalates the time commitment.\n\nMoreover, the potential for subsequent appeals triggers a cascade of additional hearings and\n\nreviews, diverting resources from other essential departmental functions.\n\n       48.     Upon information and belief, the federal Government\u2019s pretextual claim that such\n\nterminations are not reductions in force is likely to necessitate extensive and irreparable costs\n\nand resource expenditures by the Department of Workforce Solutions.\n\nIncreased Unemployment Benefits\n\n       49.     Finally, New Mexico will also bear increased costs in the form of unemployment\n\nbenefits of displaced federal employees.

The TRO required, inter alia, that Restrained Defendants reinstate\n\nall Affected Probationary Employees, as those terms are defined in the TRO, by 1:00 p.m. EDT\n\non Monday, March 17, 2025. (Id.) Pursuant to the terms of the TRO, the Government has filed a\n\nStatus Report apprising the Court of its efforts toward compliance with the TRO\u2019s substantive\n\nrequirements. (ECF No. 52.)\n\n       The Court has carefully reviewed the Status Report.       Upon that review, it is now\n\nORDERED that:\n\n            1. The Status Report reflects that the Restrained Defendants have made meaningful\n\n               progress toward compliance with the TRO.\n\n            2. On or before Monday, March 24, 2025, at 1:00 p.m. EDT, the Restrained\n\n               Defendants SHALL FILE an updated Status Report, apprising the Court of the\n\n               Restrained Defendants\u2019 additional steps towards compliance. The Court expects\n\n               that this updated Status Report will show that the Restrained Defendants have\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB         Document 72        Filed 03/18/25      Page 2 of 2\n\n\n\n             achieved substantial compliance with the terms of the TRO. The updated Status\n\n             Report shall contain updated declarations, from appropriate personnel at each of\n\n             the Restrained Defendant agencies, addressing the reinstatement of Affected\n\n             Probationary Employees.\n\n         3. The format of the Status Report is acceptable to the Court. The Restrained\n\n             Defendants shall continue using that format for future status reports.\n\n         4. Plaintiffs are reminded of their obligation to post a bond FORTHWITH.\n\n         5.

See ECF No. 44 at 3. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel have\n\ninformed undersigned counsel that Plaintiffs do not oppose this relief. Defendants respectfully\n\nsubmit that there is good cause to grant such a nunc pro tunc extension:\n\n       1.       After the Court issued its TRO at approximately 8:30 p.m. on Thursday, March 13,\n\nundersigned counsel immediately began coordinating with the eighteen (18) restrained agencies\n\n(the \u201cRestrained Defendants\u201d) to ensure compliance with the TRO by the 1:00 p.m. deadline set\n\nby the Court.\n\n       2.       Undersigned counsel have worked diligently to communicate the TRO\u2019s\n\nrequirements to Restrained Defendants. Restrained Defendants, for their part, have worked\n\ndiligently, with assistance and coordination from undersigned counsel, to comply with those\n\nrequirements on the deadline established by this Court. Those compliance efforts have continued\n\n\n\n\n                                                1\n\f        Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 53        Filed 03/17/25      Page 2 of 4\n\n\n\nunabated through Saturday and Sunday, March 15 and 16, and continue through Monday, March\n\n17, up to and including the 1 p.m. compliance deadline.\n\n       3.      As detailed in the report and declarations submitted by Defendants at 7:43 p.m. on\n\nMarch 17, 2025, due to the diligent efforts of numerous personnel, all the Restrained Defendants\n\nsubstantially complied with the TRO, with some limited delays to due to unanticipated\n\ntechnological and logistical complications.\n\n       4.      While working with the Restrained Defendants to ensure compliance with the 1:00\n\np.m. deadline, undersigned counsel were simultaneously coordinating the preparation of 18\n\ndeclarations and a report documenting that compliance. Undersigned counsel enlisted several\n\nadditional Department of Justice attorneys, not assigned to handle this case, to assist with this task\n\nin order to meet the compliance report deadline, which was originally likewise set at 1:00 pm on\n\nMarch 17.\n\n       5.      Despite these efforts, counsel determined that preparation and submission of the\n\ncompliance report and declarations by 1:00 pm\u2014the compliance deadline\u2014was infeasible.\n\nAccordingly, Defendants sought and the Court granted an extension of time to 7:00 pm for this\n\nsubmission.\n\n       6.      The efforts by Defendants\u2019 counsel to meet this 7:00 pm deadline continued without\n\npause through the day on Monday, March 17. Coordinating 18 separate agency compliance\n\ndeclarations proved an extremely complex task, further complicated by last-minute technical\n\ndifficulties in formatting electronically signed declarations appropriately for ECF-filing.\n\nRegrettably, despite undersigned counsel\u2019s best efforts, these tasks ultimately took 43 minutes\n\nlonger than counsel had previously estimated was necessary.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  2\n\f        Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 53         Filed 03/17/25     Page 3 of 4\n\n\n\n       7.      Accordingly, Defendants respectfully request a 43-minute extension of time, nunc\n\npro tunc, to file the Restrained Defendants\u2019 compliance report and declarations.\n\n       8.      Defendants\u2019 counsel have sought Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel\u2019s position on this motion, and\n\nPlaintiffs\u2019 counsel have stated that Plaintiffs consent to the relief sought.\n\n\n\n                                               Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                               YAAKOV ROTH\n                                               Acting Assistant Attorney General\n                                               Civil Division\n\n                                               ERIC J.

WELLS\n\n           Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I, Krysti J. Wells declare as follows:\n\n\n           1.      I am the Director of the Office of Human Capital Operations, Office of Mission\n\nSupport, at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) headquartered in Washington,\n\nD.C. I make this Declaration based on my own personal knowledge, on information contained in\n\nthe records of the EPA, or on information provided to me by EPA employees.\n\n           2.      I have served in this position since October 22, 2023. In my role at the EPA, I am\n\nresponsible for operational personnel management. I have the responsibility for overseeing the\n\nrecording of personnel actions, including terminations. I assist in ensuring that all personnel\n\nactions comply with federal law, including those related to probationary employees.\n\n           3.      Probationary employees in the competitive service are employees who have been\n\nemployed for less than one year. In the excepted service, the trial period may be up to two years.\n\n           4.      The probationary period is part of the hiring process, and probationary employees\n\nhave limited protections against termination. The probationary period is essentially an extended\n\ftryout to determine the fitness of the employee and, according to regulation, an agency \u201cshall\n\nterminate his or her services during this period if the employee fails to demonstrate fully his or her\n\nqualifications for continued employment.\u201d\n\n       5.      On January 20, 2025, EPA received a guidance memorandum from the Office of\n\nPersonnel Management (\u201cOPM\u201d), which stated that \u201cagencies should identify all employees on\n\nprobationary periods\u201d and \u201cshould promptly determine whether those employees should be\n\nretained at the agency.\u201d\n\n       6.      EPA terminated approximately 419 probationary employees between February 14,\n\n2025 and February 21, 2025.\n\n       7.      I have been provided and have reviewed the temporary restraining order (TRO)\n\nissued in this case on March 13, 2025, requiring EPA to reinstate all Affected Probationary\n\nEmployees, as defined in paragraph 10(c) of the TRO, who were terminated on or after January\n\n20, 2025.\n\n       8.      Whether required by operation of the TRO here or another court or administrative\n\norder, reinstatement of removed employees to full duty status would impose substantial burdens\n\non EPA, cause significant confusion, and cause turmoil for the terminated employees.\n\nSpecifically, all employees offered reinstatement into full duty status would have to be onboarded\n\nagain, including going through any applicable training, filling out human resources paperwork,\n\nobtaining new security badges, re-enrolling in benefits programs and payroll, reinstituting\n\napplicable security clearance actions, receiving government furnished equipment, and other\n\nrequisite administrative actions, such as auditing personnel requests to ensure any actions that\n\nwould have otherwise been taken during their period of separation are completed.\n\n\n\n\n                                                      2\n\f       9.      Additionally, an appellate ruling could reverse the district court\u2019s order shortly after\n\nterminated employees have been reinstated (via administrative leave, leave without pay, or\n\notherwise) or have returned to full duty status. In short, employees could be subjected to multiple\n\nchanges in their employment status in a matter of weeks.\n\n       10.     Nonetheless, EPA has immediately begun reinstating Affected Probationary\n\nEmployees on a leave status, as permitted by the TRO. On March 16, 2025 between 5-6 P.M. ET,\n\nEPA sent emails to the personal email addresses of all the Affected Probationary Employees\n\nnotifying them that their terminations were rescinded, as required by the TRO.\n\n       11.     Most of these employees were returned in a paid administrative leave status. Some,\n\nwho were in an unpaid leave status prior to their termination (including students on leave for the\n\nschool year), were returned to a leave without pay status.\n\n       12.     EPA uses the Department of Interior\u2019s HR processing system, Federal Personnel\n\nand Payroll System (\u201cFPPS\u201d). FPPS was offline starting at 5 P.M. ET on March 15, 2025. It\n\nremained unexpectedly offline until approximately 12 P.M. ET on March 17, 2025. As a result,\n\nEPA has not yet processed all of the cancellations for the relevant termination actions in FPPS.\n\nHowever, all of the timecards were updated to change the Affected Probationary Employees\u2019\n\nstatuses and, as noted above, Affected Probationary Employees all received a notice that their\n\ntermination was rescinded on March 16, 2025.\n\n\n\n       Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true\nand correct.\n                                                               Dated: March 17, 2025\n                                                                                       Digitally signed by KRYSTI\n\n                                                               /s/ KRYSTI WELLS WELLS\n                                                                                Date: 2025.03.17 17:31:01\n                                                                                       -04'00'\n\n                                                               Krysti J.

I am the Acting Chief Human Capital Officer at the United States Department of\n\nEnergy (\u201cDOE\u201d) headquartered in Washington, D.C. I make this Declaration based on my own\n\npersonal knowledge, on information contained in the records of DOE, or on information provided\n\nto me by DOE employees.\n\n           2.      I have served in this position since February 28, 2025. In my Acting role at DOE,\n\nI oversee those responsible for personnel management. I oversee those responsible for personnel\n\nenterprise and tracking and recording of personnel actions, including terminations. I assist in\n\nensuring that all personnel actions comply with federal law, including those related to probationary\n\nemployees.\n\n           3.      Probationary employees in the competitive service are generally employees who\n\nhave been employed for less than one year. In the excepted service, the trial period may be up to\n\ntwo years.\n\f       4.      The probationary period is part of the hiring process, and probationary employees\n\nhave limited protections against termination. The probationary period is an extended tryout to\n\ndetermine the fitness of the employee and, according to regulation, an agency \u201cshall terminate his\n\nor her services during this period if the employee fails to demonstrate fully his or her qualifications\n\nfor continued employment.\u201d An employee\u2019s appointment is not final until they have completed\n\ntheir probationary period.\n\n       5.      On January 20, 2025, although I was not serving in this position at that time, it is\n\nmy understanding that DOE received a guidance memorandum from the Office of Personnel\n\nManagement (\u201cOPM\u201d), which stated that \u201cagencies should identify all employees on probationary\n\nperiods\u201d and \u201cshould promptly determine whether those employees should be retained at the\n\nagency.\u201d\n\n       6.      On or around February 13 and February 14, 2025, DOE terminated approximately\n\n555 probationary employees.\n\n       7.      I have been provided and have reviewed the temporary restraining order (TRO)\n\nissued in this case on March 13, 2025, requiring various Defendants including DOE to reinstate\n\nall Affected Probationary Employees, as defined in paragraph 10(c) of the TRO, who were\n\nterminated on or after January 20, 2025.\n\n       8.      Whether required by operation of the TRO here or another court or administrative\n\norder, reinstatement of removed employees to full duty status could impose burdens on DOE and\n\ncause significant confusion and turmoil for the terminated employees. Specifically, all employees\n\noffered reinstatement into full duty status are being onboarded again, including going through any\n\napplicable training, filling out human resources paperwork, obtaining new security badges, re-\n\nenrolling in benefits programs and payroll, reinstituting applicable security clearance actions,\n\n\n\n                                                      2\n\freceiving government furnished equipment, and other requisite administrative actions, such as\n\nauditing personnel requests to ensure any actions that would have otherwise been taken during\n\ntheir period of separation are completed.\n\n       9.      Additionally, an appellate ruling could reverse the district court\u2019s order shortly after\n\nterminated employees have been reinstated (via administrative leave or otherwise) or have returned\n\nto full duty status. In short, employees could be subjected to multiple changes in their employment\n\nstatus in a matter of weeks.\n\n       10.     Nonetheless, DOE has immediately begun cancelling the termination actions for all\n\nof its 555 Affected Probationary Employees. By 1:00 p.m. on March 17, 2025, DOE had cancelled\n\nthe termination notices for approximately 319 of its 555 Affected Probationary Employees and\n\nplaced them in a retroactive Administrative Leave status from the date of removal. DOE completed\n\nthis process for the remaining Affected Probationary Employees by 1:35 p.m. on March 17, 2025.\n\nIf any of these 555 employees ultimately choose not to return to employment with the Department,\n\nbut instead choose to resign, their official records (eOPF) will reflect the date of resignation\n\nspecific to the date it was communicated to leadership.\n\n       11.     All Affected Probationary Employees have been placed in a retroactive\n\nAdministrative Leave status that will continue until their badging and IT access are restored, at\n\nwhich time they will be converted to an Active Duty status.\n\n       12.     DOE continues working to reinstate employees by working with Agency leadership\n\nto arrange for an orderly return to the office (onboarding) while the employees are in an\n\nadministrative leave status. Additionally, DOE is working to restore benefit entitlements for all\n\nthe employees and ensure all personnel records are corrected and accurate.\n\n\n\n\n                                                      3\n\f       Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true\nand correct.\n\n\n                                            Dated: March 17, 2025\n\n                                            /s/ Reesha Trznadel\n\n                                            REESHA TRZNADEL\n                                            ACTING CHIEF HUMAN CAPITAL OFFICER\n                                            US DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY\n\n\n\n\n                                                   4\n\f                           IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n                              FOR THE DISTRICT OF MARYLAND\n\n\n Maryland, et al.,\n\n                                                        Case No. 1:25-cv-00748-JKB\n            Plaintiffs,\n\n            v.\n\n United States Department of Agriculture,\n\n et al.,\n\n            Defendants.\n\n\n                            DECLARATION OF JESSICA S. PALATKA\n\n           Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I, Jessica S. Palatka declare as follows:\n\n\n           1.      I am the Chief Human Capital Officer for the U.S. Department of Commerce\n\n(Commerce) headquartered in Washington, D.C. I make this Declaration based on my own\n\npersonal knowledge, on information contained in the records of the Department of Commerce, or\n\non information provided to me by Commerce employees.\n\n           2.      I have served in this position since September 2021. In my role at Commerce, I am\n\nresponsible for personnel management. I have the responsibility for overseeing the personnel\n\nenterprise and tracking and recording of personnel actions, including terminations. I assist in\n\nensuring that all personnel actions comply with federal law, including those related to probationary\n\nemployees.\n\n           3.      Probationary employees in the competitive service are employees who have been\n\nemployed for less than one year. In the excepted service, the trial period may be up to two years.\n\f       4.      The probationary period is part of the hiring process, and probationary employees\n\nhave limited protections against termination. The probationary period is essentially an extended\n\ntryout to determine the fitness of the employee and, according to regulation, an agency \u201cshall\n\nterminate his or her services during this period if the employee fails to demonstrate fully his or her\n\nqualifications for continued employment.\u201d\n\n       5.      On January 20, 2025, Commerce received a guidance memorandum from the Office\n\nof Personnel Management (\u201cOPM\u201d), which stated that \u201cagencies should identify all employees on\n\nprobationary periods\u201d and \u201cshould promptly determine whether those employees should be\n\nretained at the agency.\u201d\n\n       6.      I have been provided and have reviewed the temporary restraining order (TRO)\n\nissued in this case on March 13, 2025, requiring Commerce to reinstate all Affected Probationary\n\nEmployees, as defined in paragraph 10(c) of the TRO, who were terminated on or after January\n\n20, 2025.\n\n       7.      Between January 20, 2025, and March 3, 2025, Commerce terminated 791\n\nprobationary employees out of approximately 9,000 total probationary and trial period employees.\n\n       8.      Whether required by operation of the TRO here or another court or administrative\n\norder, reinstatement of removed employees to full duty status would impose substantial burdens\n\non Commerce, cause significant confusion, and cause turmoil for the terminated employees.\n\nSpecifically, all employees offered reinstatement into full duty status would have to be onboarded\n\nagain, including going through any applicable training, filling out human resources paperwork,\n\nobtaining new security badges, re-enrolling in benefits programs and payroll, reinstituting\n\napplicable security clearance actions, receiving government furnished equipment, and other\n\n\n\n\n                                                      2\n\frequisite administrative actions, such as auditing personnel requests to ensure any actions that\n\nwould have otherwise been taken during their period of separation are completed.\n\n       9.      Additionally, an appellate ruling could reverse the district court\u2019s order shortly after\n\nterminated employees have been reinstated (via administrative leave or otherwise) or have returned\n\nto full duty status. In short, employees could be subjected to multiple changes in their employment\n\nstatus in a matter of weeks.\n\n       10.     Nonetheless, Commerce immediately began reinstating Affected Probationary\n\nEmployees. Twenty-seven of the 791 employees had been reinstated within days of their\n\nterminations for various operational reasons. As to the remaining 764 Affected Probationary\n\nEmployees, Commerce has issued notification of their reinstatement pursuant to the TRO. By 1:00\n\npm EDT today, March 17, 2025, Commerce had notified 736 of the Affected Probationary\n\nEmployees of their reinstatement. For the remaining 28 Affected Probationary Employees, as of\n\n1:00 pm EDT today, March 17, 2025, Commerce had not yet been able to locate personal contact\n\ninformation for those Affected Probationary Employees; however, as of 4:15pm on March 17,\n\nCommerce had notified all 764 Affected Probationary Employees of their reinstatement.\n\n       11.     Commerce will maintain all Affected Probationary Employees reinstated pursuant\n\nto the TRO in administrative leave status, retroactive to the date of termination.\n\n       12.     While it was not feasible for Commerce to process all administrative actions to\n\ncomplete the reinstatements by the time of filing, Commerce is working diligently to finalize them\n\nwithin seven days; all reinstatements will nonetheless be retroactive to the date of termination.\n\n\n\n\n                                                      3\n\f       Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true\nand correct.\n                                                            Dated: March 17, 2025\n                                                                                    Digitally signed by\n                                                                JESSICA             JESSICA PALATKA\n                                                            /s/ PALATKA             Date: 2025.03.17\n                                                                                    18:40:04 -04'00'\n                                                            Jessica S.

I am the Chief Human Capital Officer of the Department of Homeland Security\n\n(DHS) headquartered in Washington, D.C. I oversee the human capital functions of the DHS and\n\nits Components, including the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the\n\nCybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and United States Customs and\n\nImmigration Services (USCIS). I make this Declaration based on my own personal knowledge,\n\non information contained in the records of the DHS, or on information provided to me by DHS\n\nemployees.\n\n           2.      I have served in this position since March 13, 2022. In my role at the DHS, I am\n\nresponsible for personnel management. I have the responsibility for overseeing the personnel\n\nenterprise and the tracking and recording of personnel actions, including terminations. I assist in\n\fensuring that all personnel actions comply with federal law, including those related to probationary\n\nemployees.\n\n       3.      Probationary employees in the competitive service are employees who have less\n\nthan one year of current continuous service under other than a temporary appointment. In the\n\nexcepted service, the trial period may require up to two years of current continuous service in the\n\nsame or similar positions.\n\n       4.      The probationary period is part of the hiring process, and probationary employees\n\nhave limited protections against termination. The probationary period is essentially an extended\n\ntryout to determine the fitness of the employee and, according to regulation, an agency \u201cshall\n\nterminate his or her services during this period if the employee fails to demonstrate fully his or her\n\nqualifications for continued employment.\u201d\n\n       5.      On January 20, 2025, the DHS received a guidance memorandum from the Office\n\nof Personnel Management (\u201cOPM\u201d), which stated that \u201cagencies should identify all employees on\n\nprobationary periods\u201d and \u201cshould promptly determine whether those employees should be\n\nretained at the agency.\u201d\n\n       6.      The DHS terminated approximately 313 probationary employees between January\n\n20, 2025 and March 14, 2025.         This number excludes probationary employees who were\n\nterminated in individualized actions based on their performance or conduct, and therefore excludes\n\nindividuals who do not meet the definition of \u201cAffected Probationary Employees\u201d in paragraph\n\n10(c) of the Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) entered in this case on March 13, 2025.\n\n       7.      I have been provided and have reviewed the TRO issued in this case on March 13,\n\n2025, requiring the DHS to reinstate all Affected Probationary Employees, as defined in paragraph\n\n10(c) of the TRO, who were terminated on or after January 20, 2025.\n\n\n\n                                                      2\n\f       8.      Whether required by operation of the TRO here or another court or administrative\n\norder, reinstatement of removed employees to full duty status would impose substantial burdens\n\non the DHS, cause significant confusion, and cause turmoil for the terminated employees.\n\nSpecifically, to the extent that employees are offered reinstatement into full duty status (as opposed\n\nto administrative leave), they would have to be onboarded again, including going through any\n\napplicable training, filling out human resources paperwork, obtaining new security badges,\n\nreinstituting applicable security clearance actions, receiving government furnished equipment, and\n\nother requisite administrative actions.\n\n       9.      Additionally, an appellate ruling could reverse the district court\u2019s order shortly after\n\nterminated employees have been reinstated (via administrative leave or otherwise) or have returned\n\nto full duty status. In short, employees could be subjected to multiple changes in their employment\n\nstatus in a matter of weeks.\n\n       10.     Nonetheless, the DHS has immediately begun reinstating Affected Probationary\n\nEmployees. The DHS personnel system is linked to its payroll system, and personnel actions are\n\nprocessed with each payroll cycle. Thus, complete reinstatement is a multi-stage process that\n\nrequires preparing personnel actions for processing with the next payroll cycle. By 1:00 PM on\n\nMarch 17, 2025, the DHS took steps to place Affected Probationary Employees into administrative\n\nleave and, has prepared more than 310 personnel actions for processing. Of the 313 Affected\n\nProbationary Employees, the DHS identified 1 employee who declined reinstatement, 1 employee\n\nwho is currently employed by the DHS in another Component, and another employee who was\n\nalready returning to service in order to participate in the Deferred Resignation Program. In\n\naddition to preparing personnel actions for processing, the DHS has sent notice of reinstatement\n\nto affected probationary employees. The DHS is working diligently to take all other necessary\n\n\n\n                                                      3\n\factions to reinstate medical benefits and assess premiums, process within-grade increases and other\n\nsecondary personnel actions, correct leave balances, and carry out other administrative tasks. For\n\nAffected Probationary Employees who do not want to be reinstated (e.g., probationary employees\n\nwho obtained alternative employment and do not want to come back), DHS is offering the option\n\nof voluntary resignation.\n\n       11.     Employees reinstated pursuant to the TRO have been placed into administrative\n\nleave with full pay and benefits.\n\n       12.     DHS continues working to ensure that all Affected Employees are reinstated as\n\nquickly as possible.\n\n\n\n       Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true\nand correct.\n                                                            Dated: March 17, 2025\n\n                                                             BENJAMIN Digitally signed by\n                                                                       BENJAMIN R EDWARDS\n\n                                                             R EDWARDS Date: 2025.03.17\n                                                                       18:48:48 -04'00'\n\n\n                                                            Roland Edwards\n\n\n\n\n                                                    4\n\f                           IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n                              FOR THE DISTRICT OF MARYLAND\n\n\n Maryland, et al.,\n\n                                                       Case No. 1:25-cv-00748-JKB\n            Plaintiffs,\n\n            V.\n\n United States Department of Agriculture,\n\n et al.,\n\n\n            Defendants.\n\n\n                                 DECLARATION OF ANNE BYRD\n\n           Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I, Anne Byrd, declare as follows:\n\n\n           1.      I am the Assistant Secretary for Administration for the United States Department\n\nof Transportation, which is headquartered in Washington, D.C. I make this Declaration based on\n\nmy own personal knowledge, on information contained in the records of the United States\n\nDepartment of Transportation, or on information provided to me by United States Department of\n\nTransportation employees.\n\n           2.     I have served in this position since February 25, 2025. In my role at the United\n\nStates Department of Transportation, I serve as the Department's Chief Human Capital Officer\n\npursuant to Secretarial delegation. 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.38. I am responsible for personnel management.\n\nI have the responsibility for overseeing the personnel enterprise and tracking and recording of\n\npersonnel actions, including terminations. I assist in ensuring that all personnel actions comply\n\nwith federal law, including those related to probationary employees. Prior to my appointment, I\n\nserved as a Senior Advisor to the Secretary of Transportation since February 3, 2025.\n\f         3.       Probationary employees in the competitive service are employees who have been\n\nemployed for less than one year. In the excepted service, the trial period may be up to two years.\n\n         4.       The probationary period is part of the hiring process, and probationary employees\n\nhave limited protections against termination. The probationary period is essentially an extended\n\ntryout to determine the fitness of the employee and, according to regulation, an agency \"shall\n\nterminate his or her services during this period if the employee fails to demonstrate fully his or her\n\nqualifications for continued employment.''\n\n         5.       On January 20, 2025, the United States Department of Transportation received a\n\nguidance memorandum from the Office of Personnel Management (\"OPM\"), which stated that\n\n\"agencies should identify all employees on probationary periods\" and \"should promptly determine\n\nwhether those employees should be retained at the agency.\"\n\n         6.      I have been provided and have reviewed the temporary restraining order (TRO)\n\nissued in this case on March 13, 2025, requiring the United States Department of Transportation\n\nto reinstate all Affected Probationary Employees, as defined in paragraph l0(c) of the TRO, who\n\nwere terminated on or after January 20, 2025.\n\n         7.      The United States Department of Transportation terminated approximately 788\n\nprobationary employees between February 14 and 24, 2025. Of these employees, 775 are Affected\n\nProbationary Employees. 1\n\n         8.      Whether required by operation of the TRO or another court or administrative order,\n\nreinstatement of removed employees to full duty status would impose substantial burdens on the\n\nUnited States Department of Transportation, cause significant confusion, and cause turmoil for the\n\n\n\n1\n  Of the remaining 13 terminated employees, two were terminated based on individualized performance-based\ndeterminations, eight had their terminations rescinded before issuance of the TRO, two resigned, and one accepted\nthe Deferred Resignation Program.\n\n                                                             2\n\fterminated employees. Specifically, all employees offered reinstatement into full duty status\n\nwould have to be onboarded again, including filling out human resources paperwork, obtaining\n\nnew security badges, re-enrolling in benefits programs and payroll, reinstituting applicable security\n\nclearance actions, receiving government furnished equipment, and other requisite administrative\n\nactions, such as auditing personnel requests to ensure any actions that would have otherwise been\n\ntaken during their period of separation are completed.\n\n       9.      Additionally, an appellate ruling could reverse the district court's order shortly after\n\nterminated employees have been reinstated (via administrative leave or otherwise) or have returned\n\nto duty status. In short, employees could be subjected to multiple changes in their employment\n\nstatus in a matter of weeks.\n\n       10.     Nonetheless, the United States Department of Transportation has immediately\n\nbegun reinstating Affected Probationary Employees. On Monday, March 17, 2025, the United\n\nStates Department of Transportation informed 775 Affected Probationary Employees that it is\n\nrescinding the termination of their probationary/trial period termination and that they are being\n\nreinstated. Approximately 757 of these employees were informed of their reinstatement by 1:00\n\np.m. EDT. The remaining employees were informed no later than 1:10 p.m. EDT. The Department\n\nhas notified all Affected Probationary Employees that they have been reinstated, and it is working\n\ndiligently to complete additional administrative processes related to the reinstatement of these\n\nemployees.\n\n       11.     All terminated probationary employees will be reinstated with pay and benefits to\n\ntheir previous position with the Department of Transportation and the federal service. They will\n\nreceive their regular compensation for the period from February 15, 2025, to their return to duty.\n\nThe record of the termination will be removed from their Official Personnel Folder.\n\n\n\n                                                      3\n\f        12.    In order to effectuate an orderly return to the Department of Transportation, the\n\nterminated probationary employees will be placed on paid administrative leave through\n\nWednesday, March 19, 2025. The Department of Transportation will coordinate the specifics of\n\ntheir return, including the restoration of their government equipment and Personal Identity\n\nVerification (PIV) card. Employees who decline to return will be directed to submit a formal\n\nwritten resignation from their position of record no later than Wednesday, March 19, 2025.

I make this Declaration based on my own personal knowledge,\n\non information contained in the records of the Department of Education, or on information\n\nprovided to me by the Department of Education employees.\n\n           2.      I have served in this position since June 19, 2022. In my role at the Department of\n\nEducation, I am responsible for personnel management. I have the responsibility for overseeing\n\nthe personnel enterprise and tracking and recording of personnel actions, including terminations.\n\nI assist in ensuring that all personnel actions comply with federal law, including those related to\n\nprobationary employees.\n\n           3.      Probationary employees in the competitive service are employees who have been\n\nemployed for less than one year. In the excepted service, the trial period may be up to two years.\n\f       4.      The probationary period is part of the hiring process, and probationary employees\n\nhave limited protections against termination. The probationary period is essentially an extended\n\ntryout to determine the fitness of the employee and, according to regulation, an agency \u201cshall\n\nterminate his or her services during this period if the employee fails to demonstrate fully his or her\n\nqualifications for continued employment.\u201d\n\n       5.      On January 20, 2025, the Department of Education received a guidance\n\nmemorandum from the Office of Personnel Management (\u201cOPM\u201d), which stated that \u201cagencies\n\nshould identify all employees on probationary periods\u201d and \u201cshould promptly determine whether\n\nthose employees should be retained at the agency.\u201d\n\n       6.      The Department of Education terminated 65 probationary employees out of\n\napproximately 108 probationary employees between February and March, 2025.\n\n       7.      I have been provided and have reviewed the temporary restraining order (TRO)\n\nissued in this case on March 13, 2025, requiring the Department of Education to reinstate all\n\nAffected Probationary Employees, as defined in paragraph 10(c) of the TRO, who were terminated\n\non or after January 20, 2025.\n\n       8.      Whether required by operation of the TRO here or another court or administrative\n\norder, reinstatement of removed employees to full duty status would impose substantial burdens\n\non the Department of Education, cause significant confusion, and cause turmoil for the terminated\n\nemployees. Specifically, all employees offered reinstatement into full duty status would have to\n\nbe onboarded again, including going through any applicable training, filling out human resources\n\npaperwork, obtaining new security badges, re-enrolling in benefits programs and payroll,\n\nreinstituting applicable security clearance actions, receiving government furnished equipment, and\n\n\n\n\n                                                      2\n\fother requisite administrative actions, such as auditing personnel requests to ensure any actions\n\nthat would have otherwise been taken during their period of separation are completed.\n\n       9.      Additionally, an appellate ruling could reverse the district court\u2019s order shortly after\n\nterminated employees have been reinstated or have returned to full duty status. In short, employees\n\ncould be subjected to multiple changes in their employment status in a matter of weeks.\n\n       10.     Nonetheless, the Department of Education processed reinstatements for the 65\n\nAffected Probationary Employees prior to 1:00pm Monday, March 17, 2025. To the extent that\n\nthe Department must complete additional administrative processes related to the reinstatement of\n\nthese employees, the Department is acting diligently to complete such processes.\n\n       11.     All Affected Probationary Employees will be placed on paid administrative leave.\n\n\n\n       Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true\nand correct.\n                                                               Dated: March 17, 2025\n\n                                                                   JACQUEL Digitally signed by\n                                                                            JACQUELINE CLAY\n                                                               /s/ INE CLAY Date: 2025.03.17\n                                                                            18:11:57 -04'00'\n\n                                                               Jacqueline Clay\n\n\n\n\n                                                      3\n\f                           IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n                              FOR THE DISTRICT OF MARYLAND\n\n\n Maryland, et al.,\n\n                                                        Case No. 1:25-cv-00748-JKB\n            Plaintiffs,\n\n            v.\n\n United States Department of Agriculture,\n\n et al.,\n\n            Defendants.\n\n\n                                DECLARATION OF LORI A.

I am the Chief Human Capital Officer, Department of Housing and Urban\n\nDevelopment, headquartered in Washington, D.C. I make this Declaration based on my own\n\npersonal knowledge, on information contained in the records of the U.S. Department of Housing\n\nand Urban Development (HUD), or on information provided to me by HUD employees.\n\n           2.      I have served in this position since February 2021. In my role at the Department of\n\nHousing and Urban Development, I am responsible for personnel management. I have the\n\nresponsibility for overseeing the personnel enterprise and the tracking and recording of personnel\n\nactions, including terminations.

HUD terminated approximately 312 probationary employees out of approximately\n\n549 probationary employees on February 14, 2025.\n\n       7.      I have been provided with and have reviewed the temporary restraining order\n\n(TRO) issued in this case on March 13, 2025, requiring HUD to reinstate all Affected Probationary\n\nEmployees, as defined in paragraph 10(c) of the TRO, who were terminated on or after January\n\n20, 2025.\n\n       8.

Additionally, an appellate ruling could reverse the district court\u2019s order shortly after\n\nterminated employees have been reinstated (via administrative leave or otherwise) or before or\n\nafter they have returned to full duty status. In short, employees could be subjected to multiple\n\nchanges in their employment status in a matter of weeks.\n\n       10.     Nonetheless, HUD has immediately begun reinstating Affected Probationary\n\nEmployees. As of this time, HUD has fully reinstated 13 employees, and by 1 pm on March 17,\n\n2025 initiated reinstatement actions for 299 probationary employees.\n\n       11.     Eleven employees were reinstated effective March 10, 2025, and two were\n\nreinstated effective March 12, 2025. Two hundred ninety-nine Affected Probationary Employees\n\nare being placed on administrative leave temporarily effective March 17, 2025.\n\n       12.     HUD has initiated the action to reinstate the 299 Affected Probationary Employees\n\nby the 1:00 p.m. deadline given by the TRO. Email notifications are being sent to the affected\n\nemployees beginning March 17, 2025, with information regarding their reinstatement.\n\n       Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true\nand correct.\n                                                              Dated: March 17, 2025\n                                                                               Digitally signed by: LORI\n                                                                    LORI       MICHALSKI\n                                                                               DN: CN = LORI MICHALSKI C\n\n                                                                    MICHALSK   = US O = U.S. Government OU\n\n\n                                                              /s/\n                                                                               = Department of Housing and\n                                                                               Urban Development\n\n                                                                    I          Date: 2025.03.17 18:25:58 -\n                                                                               04'00'\n\n\n\n\n                                                              Lori A.

GREEN\n\n           Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I, Mark D. Green, declare as follows:\n\n\n           1.      I am the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Human Capital, Learning, and Safety at the\n\nU.S. Department of the Interior (\u201cDepartment\u201d), headquartered in Washington, D.C. I have served\n\nin this position since September 2022. I make this Declaration based on my own personal\n\nknowledge, on information contained in the records of the Department, or on information provided\n\nto me by Department employees.\n\n           2.      In my role at the Department, I am responsible for personnel management. I have\n\nthe responsibility for overseeing the personnel enterprise and tracking and recording of personnel\n\nactions, including terminations. I assist in ensuring that all personnel actions comply with federal\n\nlaw, including those related to probationary and trial period appointees.\n\n           3.      Probationary appointees in the competitive service are individuals who have been\n\nworking in their respective positions for less than one year. In the excepted service, the trial period\n\nis generally two years.\n\f       4.      Probationary and trial periods are part of the hiring process, and probationary and\n\ntrial period appointees have extremely limited protections against termination compared to\n\nindividuals who satisfy the definition of \u201cemployee,\u201d and accordingly enjoy greater due process\n\nprotections. Probationary and trial periods are essentially extended tryouts for finalized\n\nappointments. Supervisors evaluate probationary and trial period appointees to determine whether\n\nthe individuals would be a good fit for long-term employment. While working throughout\n\nprobationary or trial periods, individuals receive no assurance of final appointments or of\n\nbecoming permanent employees.\n\n       5.      On or about January 20, 2025, I reviewed a guidance memorandum issued by the\n\nOffice of Personnel Management (\u201cOPM\u201d), which requested that the Department and other\n\nagencies review all probationary and trial period appointees and identify which individuals should\n\nbe retained and which should be terminated. Consistent with the OPM guidance, the Department\n\nreviewed all probationary and trial period appointees\u2019 performances to determine which\n\nindividuals to keep and which to terminate. The Department continued this review process even\n\nafter OPM clarified its earlier guidance on February 14 and 24, 2025.\n\n       6.      On or after February 14, 2025, the Department retained, and did not terminate, the\n\ncompetitive service appointments of 1968 individuals during their respective probationary periods\n\nand did not terminate the excepted service appointments of 422 individuals during their respective\n\ntrial periods. However, on or after February 14, 2025, the Department did terminate the\n\ncompetitive service appointments of 1303 individuals during their respective probationary periods\n\nand did terminate the excepted service appointments of 409 individuals during their respective trial\n\nperiods, for a total of 1712 termination actions taken by the Department. Although OPM offered\n\nlanguage for potential use in developing termination notices, the Department did not adopt OPM\u2019s\n\n\n\n                                                     2\n\fsuggestions, and instead, independently developed language used in the termination notices that\n\ninformed affected individuals of these personnel decisions.\n\n       7.      I have been provided and have reviewed the temporary restraining order (TRO)\n\nissued in this litigation on March 13, 2025, requiring the Department to reinstate all Affected\n\nProbationary [and Trial Period Appointees], as such individuals are defined in paragraph 10(c) of\n\nthe TRO, who were terminated on or after January 20, 2025.\n\n       8.      Whether required by operation of the TRO here or another court or administrative\n\norder, the reinstatement of all probationary and trial period appointees whom the Department\n\nterminated on or after February 14, 2025, imposes substantial burdens on the Department, causes\n\nsignificant confusion, and will potentially subject terminated individuals to the receipt of\n\nconflicting or contradictory information. Specifically, reinstating terminated appointees imposes\n\nsignificant administrative burdens on the Department. Among other things, all reinstated\n\nindividuals must be onboarded again, which includes the labor-intensive processes of coordinating\n\nhuman resources efforts and paperwork, issuing new security badges and government-furnished\n\nequipment, reinstituting applicable security clearance actions, arranging for any necessary and\n\napplicable training, re-enrolling affected individuals in benefits programs, assessing the\n\nappropriateness of granting reinstated appointees administrative leave, and calculating and\n\nprocessing the amount of any financial obligation that the Department may owe as a result of the\n\nreinstatements and the amounts, if any, that reinstated individuals request to have withheld for\n\nvarious work-related benefits. The Department must also take other requisite administrative\n\nactions, such as evaluating the off-duty actions of reinstated appointees during the period of\n\nseparation, and auditing personnel requests to ensure any actions that would have otherwise been\n\ntaken during their period of separation are completed.\n\n\n\n                                                    3\n\f        9.      Additionally, reinstating terminated appointees causes confusion for the\n\nDepartment and reinstated individuals, more than four hundred forty (440) of whom have appeals\n\ncurrently pending before Administrative Judges assigned to U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board\n\n(MSPB) Regional and Field Offices. Persons who were terminated just weeks ago have now been\n\nreinstated, and the effect of these reinstatements will impact pending or potential MSPB appeals\n\nand will compel preservation, at least temporarily, of the now-rescinded termination actions. Yet,\n\nan appellate ruling could reverse the district court\u2019s order shortly after terminated individuals have\n\nbeen reinstated through extended grants of administrative leave, complete restoration to full-duty\n\nstatus, or otherwise. The Department could reverse reinstatements in that circumstance and\n\ncorrespondingly impact pending or potential or dismissed MSPB appeals. And even though the\n\nterminated individuals have now been reinstated prior to any reversal of the district court\u2019s order,\n\nthe reinstated individuals remain probationary or trial period appointees and can again be subject\n\nto termination actions, which would again inform affected individuals of their rights associated\n\nwith filing MSPB appeals, filing complaints pursuant to processes established by the U.S. Equal\n\nEmployment Opportunity Commission, and filing complaints pursuant to processes established by\n\nthe U.S. Office of Special Counsel. In short, reinstated individuals will be subjected to multiple\n\nchanges in their employment status in a matter of weeks and will be forced to untangle the maze\n\nof their potential appeal rights.\n\n        10.     The tremendous uncertainty associated with this confusion and these administrative\n\nburdens impede supervisors from appropriately managing their workforce. Work schedules and\n\nassignments are effectively being tied to hearing and briefing schedules set by the courts. It will\n\nbe extremely difficult to assign new work to reinstated individuals in light of the uncertainty over\n\ntheir future status.\n\n\n\n                                                      4\n\f       11.     Finally, reinstating terminated appointees interferes with the effective functioning\n\nof the Department. On and after February 14, 2025, the Department has made meaningful changes\n\nto address the challenged terminations, including reassigning the duties performed by the\n\nterminated individuals, many of whom will have no duties to perform upon reinstatement.\n\n       12.     Nonetheless, the Department has complied with the TRO by reinstating affected\n\nprobationary period and trial period appointees. As of 1 p.m. EDT on this date, the Department\n\nhad (a) reinstated, by cancelling termination actions (a very time and labor intensive process) for,\n\napproximately forty-five percent (45%) of the 1301 individuals whose competitive service\n\nappointments the Department had terminated during their respective probationary periods and had\n\n(b) reinstated, by cancelling termination actions for, approximately twenty-five percent (25%) of\n\nthe 409 individuals whose excepted service appointments the Department had terminated during\n\ntheir respective trial periods. As of the time and date of this declaration, the Department had (c)\n\nreinstated, by cancelling termination actions for, approximately ninety-five percent (95%) of the\n\n1301 individuals whose competitive service appointments the Department had terminated during\n\ntheir respective probationary periods and had (d) reinstated, by cancelling termination actions for,\n\napproximately seventy-five percent (75%) of the 409 individuals whose excepted service\n\nappointments the Department had terminated during their respective trial periods. Accordingly, as\n\nof the time and date of this declaration, the Department had reinstated, by cancelling termination\n\nactions for, approximately ninety percent (90%) of the 1710 individuals whom the Department had\n\nterminated during their respective probationary or trial periods on or after February 14, 2025.\n\nThroughout the remainder of this date, the Department will continue the reinstatement process, by\n\ncancelling termination actions, for the remaining ten percent (10%) of the 1710 individuals whom\n\nthe Department terminated during their respective probationary or trial periods on or after February\n\n\n\n                                                     5\n\f14, 2025. The Department does not intend to reinstate two (2) individuals, both of whom qualify\n\nfor exclusions from the TRO in accordance with 10(c).\n\n       13.     The Department has notified or attempted to notify, telephonically and\n\nelectronically (via personal email addresses where and when known to the Department), all\n\naffected individuals of these reinstatement actions and the cancellations of the termination\n\ndecisions, but to the extent that the Department needs to complete additional administrative\n\nprocesses related to these reinstatement/cancellation efforts, the Department continues to work\n\ndiligently to complete such processes.\n\n       14.     The Department will continue to analyze all data and information relevant to\n\ntermination actions, taken on or after February 14, 2025, that have affected or will affect\n\nindividuals during their respective probationary or trial periods.\n\n      Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true\nand correct.\n                                                              Dated: March 17, 2025\n                                                                             Digitally signed by\n                                                                             MARK GREEN\n                                                                             Date: 2025.03.17\n                                                              _____________________________/\n                                                                             18:27:03 -04'00'\n\n                                                              MARK D.

I am the Acting Chief Human Capital Officer of the Consumer Financial Protection\n\nBureau (\u201cBureau\u201d) headquartered in Washington, D.C. I make this Declaration based on my own\n\npersonal knowledge, on information contained in the records of the CFPB, or on information\n\nprovided to me by CFPB employees.\n\n           2.      I have served in this position since approximately, Monday, October 21, 2024. In\n\nmy role at the CFPB, I am responsible for personnel management. I have the responsibility for\n\noverseeing the personnel enterprise and tracking and recording of personnel actions, including\n\nterminations. I assist in ensuring that all personnel actions comply with federal law, including those\n\nrelated to probationary employees.\n\n           3.      Probationary employees in the competitive service are employees who have been\n\nemployed for less than one year. In the excepted service, the trial period may be up to two years.\n\f       4.      The probationary period is part of the hiring process, and probationary employees\n\nhave limited protections against termination. The probationary period is essentially an extended\n\ntryout to determine the fitness of the employee and, according to regulation, an agency \u201cshall\n\nterminate his or her services during this period if the employee fails to demonstrate fully his or her\n\nqualifications for continued employment.\u201d\n\n       5.      On January 20, 2025, the CFPB received a guidance memorandum from the Office\n\nof Personnel Management (\u201cOPM\u201d), which stated that \u201cagencies should identify all employees on\n\nprobationary periods\u201d and \u201cshould promptly determine whether those employees should be\n\nretained at the agency.\u201d\n\n       6.      The CFPB terminated 117 probationary employees between February 11, 2025, and\n\nFebruary 13, 2025.\n\n       7.      I have been provided and have reviewed the temporary restraining order (TRO)\n\nissued in this case on March 13, 2025, requiring the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to\n\nreinstate all Affected Probationary Employees, as defined in paragraph 10(c) of the TRO, who\n\nwere terminated on or after January 20, 2025,\n\n       8.      Whether required by operation of the TRO here or another court or administrative\n\norder, reinstatement of removed employees to full duty status will impose substantial burdens on\n\nthe CFPB, cause significant confusion, and cause turmoil for the terminated employees.\n\nSpecifically, all employees offered reinstatement into full duty status will have to be onboarded\n\nagain, including the possibility of completing any applicable training, filling out human resources\n\npaperwork, obtaining new security badges, reinstituting applicable security clearance actions,\n\nreceiving government furnished equipment, and other requisite administrative actions, such as\n\n\n\n\n                                                      2\n\fauditing personnel requests to ensure any actions that would have otherwise been taken during\n\ntheir period of separation are completed.\n\n       9.      Additionally, an appellate ruling could reverse the district court\u2019s order shortly after\n\nterminated employees have been reinstated (via administrative leave or otherwise) or have returned\n\nto full duty status. In short, employees could be subjected to multiple changes in their employment\n\nstatus in a matter of weeks.\n\n       10.     Nonetheless, the CFPB has immediately begun reinstating Affected Probationary\n\nEmployees. By 3:30 pm on March 16, 2025, the CFPB reinstated 117 Affected Probationary\n\nEmployees. While CFPB has notified all Affected Probationary Employees that they have been\n\nreinstated, to the extent CFPB needs to complete additional administrative processes related to the\n\nreinstatement of these employees, CFPB is acting diligently to complete such processes.\n\n       11.     All reinstated employees will be immediately placed on administrative leave status\n\nwhile the CFPB continues to act to comply with the TRO and/or employees are to be assigned\n\nwork by management/supervisors.\n\n\n\n       Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true\nand correct.\n                                                               Dated: March 17, 2025\n                                                                              Digitally signed by\n                                                                ADAM          ADAM MARTINEZ\n\n                                                                MARTINEZ Date:      2025.03.17\n                                                               ____________________________\n                                                                              17:17:22 -04'00'\n\n\n                                                               Adam Martinez\n\n\n\n\n                                                      3\n\f                           IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n                              FOR THE DISTRICT OF MARYLAND\n\n\n Maryland, et al.,\n\n                                                         Case No. 1:25-cv-00748-JKB\n            Plaintiffs,\n\n            v.\n\n United States Department of Agriculture,\n\n et al.,\n\n            Defendants.\n\n\n                          DECLARATION OF BEATRICE (JULIE) BRILL\n\n           Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I, Beatrice Julie Brill declare as follows:\n\n\n           1.      I am the Acting Chief Human Capital Officer of the Small Business Administration\n\n(SBA), Office of Human Resources Solutions, (OHRS) headquartered in Washington, D.C. I\n\nmake this Declaration based on my own personal knowledge, on information contained in the\n\nrecords of the SBA, or on information provided to me by SBA employees.\n\n           2.      I have served in this position since February 12, 2025. In my role at the SBA, I am\n\nresponsible for personnel management. I have the responsibility for overseeing the personnel\n\nenterprise and tracking and recording of personnel actions, including terminations. I assist in\n\nensuring that all personnel actions comply with federal law, including those related to probationary\n\nemployees.\n\n           3.      Probationary employees in the competitive service are employees who have been\n\nemployed for less than one year. In the excepted service, the trial period may be up to two years.\n\f         4.

On January 20, 2025, SBA received a guidance memorandum from the Office of\n\nPersonnel Management (\u201cOPM\u201d), which stated that \u201cagencies should identify all employees on\n\nprobationary periods\u201d and \u201cshould promptly determine whether those employees should be\n\nretained at the agency.\u201d\n\n         6.    The Agency terminated 304 probationary employees out of approximately 700\n\nprobationary employees between February 11, 2025, and February 25, 2025. On February 18,\n\n2025, SBA rehired 6 of those probationary employees. As of March 17, 2025, five remain\n\nemployed with SBA and one voluntarily resigned, and thus were unaffected by the Court\u2019s recent\n\norder.\n\n         7.    I have been provided and have reviewed the temporary restraining order (TRO)\n\nissued in this case on March 13, 2025, requiring SBA to reinstate all Affected Probationary\n\nEmployees, as defined in paragraph 10(c) of the TRO, who were terminated on or after January\n\n20, 2025,\n\n         8.    Whether required by operation of the TRO here or another court or administrative\n\norder, reinstatement of removed employees to full duty status would impose substantial burdens\n\non Interior, cause significant confusion, and cause turmoil for the terminated employees.\n\nSpecifically, all employees offered reinstatement into full duty status would have to be onboarded\n\nagain, including going through any applicable training, filling out human resources paperwork,\n\n\n\n                                                      2\n\fobtaining new security badges, re-enrolling in benefits programs and payroll, reinstituting\n\napplicable security clearance actions, receiving government furnished equipment, and other\n\nrequisite administrative actions, such as auditing personnel requests to ensure any actions that\n\nwould have otherwise been taken during their period of separation are completed.\n\n       9.      Additionally, an appellate ruling could reverse the district court\u2019s order shortly after\n\nterminated employees have been reinstated (via administrative leave or otherwise) or have returned\n\nto full duty status. In short, employees could be subject to multiple changes in their employment\n\nstatus in a matter of weeks.\n\n       10.     Nonetheless, SBA has immediately begun reinstating Affected Probationary\n\nEmployees. By 12:40 pm on March 17, 2025, SBA had sent notification to all 298 Affected\n\nProbationary Employees that they are reinstated. Seven notifications of the 298 were\n\nundeliverable, and the OHRS Office will conduct additional outreach to obtain updated employee\n\ncontact information.\n\n       11.     127 of these employees were reinstated into administrative leave and will be\n\nprovided backpay since the date of their release. 164 employees were previously on intermittent\n\nwork schedules (non-pay status) at the time of their release and are being reinstated and returned\n\ninto intermittent non-pay status (not on administrative leave). Because these employees were on\n\nan intermittent work schedule, the Agency does not owe them any backpay.\n\n       12.     SBA continues working to reinstate all Affected Probationary Employees. Further,\n\nwhile SBA has notified Affected Probationary Employees that they have been reinstated, to the\n\nextent SBA needs to complete additional administrative processes related to the reinstatement of\n\nthese employees, SBA is acting diligently to complete such processes.\n\n\n\n\n                                                      3\n\f        13.

I am the Deputy to the Acting Chairman and Chief Operating Officer of the Federal\n\nDeposit Insurance Corporation (\u201cFDIC\u201d) headquartered in Washington, D.C. I make this\n\nDeclaration based on my own personal knowledge, on information contained in the records of the\n\nFDIC, or on information provided to me by FDIC employees.\n\n           2.      I have served in this position since February 2022. In my role at the FDIC, I am\n\nresponsible for personnel management. I have the responsibility for overseeing the personnel\n\nenterprise and the tracking and recording of personnel actions, including terminations. I assist in\n\nensuring that all personnel actions comply with federal law, including those related to probationary\n\nemployees.\n\n           3.      Probationary employees in the competitive service are employees who have been\n\nemployed for less than one year. In the excepted service, the trial period may be up to two years.\n\f       4.

The FDIC terminated approximately 156 probationary employees out of\n\napproximately 261 eligible probationary employees between February 18 and 19, 2025. There\n\nwere five probationary employees terminated as a part of the group that would have otherwise\n\nbeen terminated for individualized reasons based on performance/conduct.\n\n       7.      I have been provided and have reviewed the temporary restraining order (TRO)\n\nissued in this case on March 13, 2025, requiring the FDIC to reinstate all Affected Probationary\n\nEmployees, as defined in paragraph 10(c) of the TRO, who were terminated on or after January\n\n20, 2025.\n\n       8.      Whether required by operation of the TRO here or another court or administrative\n\norder, reinstatement of removed employees would impose substantial burdens on the FDIC, cause\n\nsignificant confusion, and cause turmoil for the terminated employees. Specifically, employees\u2019\n\nmissed contributions to health benefits, flexible spending accounts, and thrift savings plan\n\ncontributions will have to be calculated and recovered; employees\u2019 time cards must be individually\n\nrestored, to include certifying the time lost during the termination; each employee would have to\n\n\n\n                                                      2\n\fpay back the lump sum payment already received for unused annual leave or set up a debt process\n\nto remit the payment back; and the FDIC security office would need to reinstate initial or bridge\n\ninvestigations for each employee.\n\n       9.      Additionally, an appellate ruling could reverse the district court\u2019s order shortly after\n\nterminated employees have been reinstated via administrative leave or have returned to full duty\n\nstatus. In short, employees could be subjected to multiple changes in their employment status in a\n\nmatter of weeks.\n\n       10.     Nonetheless, the FDIC reinstated all Affected Probationary Employees as of 11:59\n\nam today. As of this time, the FDIC has rescinded the terminations of 151 Affected Probationary\n\nEmployees.\n\n       11.     As of today, the reinstated Affected Probationary Employees have been placed into\n\npaid administrative leave status at the FDIC.\n\n\n\n\n       Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true\nand correct.\n                                                              Dated: March 17, 2025\n                                                                                     Digitally signed by\n                                                                  DANIEL             DANIEL BENDLER\n                                                                                     Date: 2025.03.17\n                                                                  BENDLER\n                                                              /s/_____________       18:07:21 -04'00'\n\n                                                              Daniel H.

I have served in this position since approximately April 2024. In my role at\n\nUSAID, I am responsible for personnel management. I have the responsibility for overseeing the\n\npersonnel enterprise and tracking and recording of personnel actions, including terminations. I\n\nassist in ensuring that all personnel actions comply with federal law, including those related to\n\nprobationary employees.\n\n           3.     Probationary employees in the competitive service are employees who have been\n\nemployed for less than one year. In the excepted service, the trial period may be up to two years.\n\f       4.      The probationary period is part of the hiring process, and probationary employees\n\nhave limited protections against termination. The probationary period is essentially an extended\n\ntryout to determine the fitness of the employee and, according to regulation, an agency \u201cshall\n\nterminate his or her services during this period if the employee fails to demonstrate fully his or\n\nher qualifications for continued employment.\u201d\n\n       5.      On January 20, 2025, USAID received a guidance memorandum from the Office\n\nof Personnel Management (\u201cOPM\u201d), which stated that \u201cagencies should identify all employees\n\non probationary periods\u201d and \u201cshould promptly determine whether those employees should be\n\nretained at the agency.\u201d\n\n       6.      USAID terminated, at the direction of USAID leadership, 270 probationary\n\nemployees out of 295, effective March 7, 2025.\n\n       7.      I have been provided and have reviewed the temporary restraining order (TRO)\n\nissued in this case on March 13, 2025, requiring USAID to reinstate all Affected Probationary\n\nEmployees, as defined in paragraph 10(c) of the TRO, who were terminated on or after January\n\n20, 2025,\n\n       8.      Upon receiving notice of the TRO, USAID immediately began reinstating\n\nAffected Probationary Employees through the following process. A cancellation of the\n\ntermination action will be processed during Pay Period 5 with an effective date of March 7,\n\n2025. The SF-50 documenting this cancellation will be available in eOPF on or about March\n\n31, 2025. HCTM will email the SF-50 to all personal email addresses it has on file during the\n\nweek of March 31, 2025.\n\n       9.      Additionally, by 1:00 pm EDT today, March 17, 2025, USAID sent a letter via\n\nemail to all Affected Probationary Employees informing them of the above actions.\n\n\n\n                                                    2\n\f       10.     Upon reinstatement, all reinstated probationary employees will be placed on paid\n\nadministrative leave until further notice.\n\n       Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true\n\nand correct.\n\n                                                            Dated: March 17, 2025\n\n\n\n                                                            /s/\n\n                                                            Sepideh Keyvanshad\n\n\n\n\n                                                    3\n\f\u000f\u0019\u0013\u001c\u001b\u0016\u0015\u0018\u0001\u0010\u0018\u001d\u0014\u0017\u0019\u001a\u0014\u0001\u0012\u000f \u0001\b\b\u0007 \u0004\b\u0006\u000f\u0002\u0011\u000e \u0004\u0002\u0006\b \u0007\u0002 \u0010\u0003\u0003\u0002 \b\u0007\u0006 \u0005\u0003\u000f   \u0006\u000f\n\n\n\n\n                                        IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n                                           FOR THE DISTRICT OF MARYLAND\n\n\n              Maryland, et al.,\n\n                         Plaintiffs,                                 Case No. 1:25-cv-00748-JKB\n\n\n                         v.\n\n              United States Department of Agriculture,\n\n              et al.,\n\n                         Defendants.\n\n\n\n                                           DECLARATION OF JEREMY TAYLOR\n\n                        Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I, Jeremy Taylor declare as follows:\n\n\n\n                        1.      I am the Deputy Chief Human Capital Officer, Office of Human Resources\n\n             Management, at the General Services Administration headquartered in Washington, D.C. I make\n\n             this Declaration based on my own personal knowledge, on information contained in the records of\n\n             the General Services Administration, or on information provided to me by General Services\n\n             Administration, Office of Human Resources employees.\n\n                        2.      I have served in this position since July 2024. In my role at the General Services\n\n             Administration, I am responsible for personnel management. I have the responsibility for\n\n             overseeing the personnel enterprise and the tracking and recording of personnel actions, including\n\n             terminations. I assist in ensuring that all personnel actions comply with federal law, including those\n\n             related to probationary employees.\n\f\u000f\u0019\u0013\u001c\u001b\u0016\u0015\u0018\u0001\u0010\u0018\u001d\u0014\u0017\u0019\u001a\u0014\u0001\u0012\u000f \u0001\b\b\u0007 \u0004\b\u0006\u000f\u0002\u0011\u000e \u0004\u0002\u0006\b \u0007\u0002 \u0010\u0003\u0003\u0002 \b\u0007\u0006 \u0005\u0003\u000f   \u0006\u000f\n\n\n\n\n                     3.       Probationary employees in the competitive service are employees who have been\n\n             employed for less than one year. In the excepted service, the trial period may be up to two years.\n\n                     4.       The probationary period is part of the hiring process, and probationary employees\n\n             have limited protections against termination. The probationary period is essentially an extended\n\n             tryout to determine the fitness of the employee and, according to regulation, an agency \u201cshall\n\n             terminate his or her services during this period if the employee fails to demonstrate fully his or her\n\n             qualifications for continued employment.\u201d\n\n                     5.       On January 20, 2025, General Services Administration received a guidance\n\n             memorandum from the Office of Personnel Management (\u201cOPM\u201d), which stated that \u201cagencies\n\n             should identify all employees on probationary periods\u201d and \u201cshould promptly determine whether\n\n             those employees should be retained at the agency.\u201d\n\n                     6.       The General Services Administration terminated approximately 366 probationary\n\n             employees out of approximately 812 probationary and trial period employees between February\n\n             13, 2025 and March 7, 2025.\n\n                     7.       I have been provided and have reviewed the temporary restraining order (TRO)\n\n             issued in this case on March 13, 2025, requiring the General Services Administration to reinstate\n\n             all Affected Probationary Employees, as defined in paragraph 10(c) of the TRO, who were\n\n             terminated on or after January 20, 2025.\n\n                     8.       Whether required by operation of the TRO here or another court or administrative\n\n             order, reinstatement of removed employees to full duty status would impose substantial burdens\n\n             on the General Services Administration, cause significant confusion, and cause turmoil for the\n\n             terminated employees. Specifically, all employees offered reinstatement into full duty status\n\n             would have to be onboarded again, including going through any applicable training, filling out\n\n\n\n                                                                   2\n\f\u000f\u0019\u0013\u001c\u001b\u0016\u0015\u0018\u0001\u0010\u0018\u001d\u0014\u0017\u0019\u001a\u0014\u0001\u0012\u000f \u0001\b\b\u0007 \u0004\b\u0006\u000f\u0002\u0011\u000e \u0004\u0002\u0006\b \u0007\u0002 \u0010\u0003\u0003\u0002 \b\u0007\u0006 \u0005\u0003\u000f   \u0006\u000f\n\n\n\n\n             human resources paperwork, obtaining new security badges, re-enrolling in benefits programs and\n\n             payroll, reinstituting applicable security clearance actions, receiving government furnished\n\n             equipment, and other requisite administrative actions, such as auditing personnel requests to ensure\n\n             any actions that would have otherwise been taken during their period of separation are completed.\n\n                     9.       Additionally, an appellate ruling could reverse the district court\u2019s order shortly after\n\n             terminated employees have been reinstated via administrative leave or have returned to full duty\n\n             status. In short, employees could be subjected to multiple changes in their employment status in a\n\n             matter of weeks.\n\n                     10.      Nonetheless, the General Services Administration has immediately begun\n\n             reinstating Affected Probationary Employees. By 9:00am on March 17, 2025, The General\n\n             Services Administration reinstated all its 366 Affected Probationary Employees. Subsequently, 2\n\n             of these employees declined to be reinstated. There are 0 decisions pending.\n\n                     11.      While General Services Administration has notified all Affected Probationary\n\n             Employees that they have been reinstated, to the extent General Services Administration needs to\n\n             complete additional administrative processes related to the reinstatement of these employees, the\n\n             General Services Administration is acting diligently to complete such processes.\n\n                     12.      As of 1:00pm today, the General Services Administration has placed the 364\n\n             reinstated probationary employees on paid administrative leave.\n\n                     Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true\n\n             and correct.\n\n                                                                              Dated: March 17, 2025\n\n\n\n                                                                              Jeremy Taylor\n\n\n\n                                                                     3\n\f\f\f\f\f                          IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n                             FOR THE DISTRICT OF MARYLAND\n\n\n Maryland, et al.,\n\n                                                       Case No. 1:25-cv-00748-JKB\n            Plaintiffs,\n\n            v.\n\n United States Department of Agriculture,\n\n et al.,\n\n            Defendants.\n\n\n                          DECLARATION OF MARY PLETCHER RICE\n\n           Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I, Mary Pletcher Rice declare as follows:\n\n\n           1.      I am the Acting Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Administration within\n\nDepartmental Administration at the United States Department of Agriculture (\u201cUSDA\u201d or\n\n\u201cDepartment\u201d) headquartered in Washington, D.C. I make this Declaration based on my own\n\npersonal knowledge, on information contained in the records of USDA, or on information provided\n\nto me by USDA employees. I have served in this position since January 31, 2025, and I have been\n\nemployed at USDA since 2018.\n\n           2.      In my role at USDA, I currently oversee the Department\u2019s Office of Human\n\nResources Management and I have purview over USDA subagencies\u2019 Chief Operating Officers\n\nand Human Resources Offices.\n\n           3.      Approximately 5,714 probationary employees were terminated from USDA\n\nbeginning February 13, 2025, and concluding on or around February 17, 2025. I have been\n\nprovided, and have reviewed, the temporary restraining order (\u201cTRO\u201d) issued in the above-\n\fcaptioned case on March 13, 2025, requiring USDA to reinstate all Affected Probationary\n\nEmployees, as defined in paragraph 10(c) of the TRO, who were terminated on or after January\n\n20, 2025.\n\n          4.   USDA is already reinstating the terminated probationary employees, pursuant to a\n\n45-day March 5, 2025, Stay Order issued by the Merit Systems Protection Board (\u201cMSPB\u201d), which\n\nwas requested by the Office of Special Counsel.\n\n          5.   On March 12, 2025, USDA reinstated all 5,714 Affected Probationary Employees\n\nby restoring them to the status they were in prior to their terminations and provided each with back\n\npay from the date of their respective termination. As part of a phased plan for return-to-duty, upon\n\nreturning to pay status, the Affected Probationary Employee will initially be placed on paid\n\nadministrative leave. USDA began the notification process on Friday March 14th to all Affected\n\nProbationary Employees confirming their reinstatement. USDA is diligently working on providing\n\nthis notice to all Affected Probationary Employees.\n\n          6.   A group of 1,070 seasonal Forest Service Affected Probationary Employees who\n\nwere not in pay status at the time of their terminations (due to the off-season) have been reinstated\n\nto their prior unpaid status. Additionally, there are six Affected Probationary Employees in the\n\nForeign Agricultural Service who were administratively furloughed prior to their terminations, and\n\nwho have been reinstated to their prior administrative furlough status.\n\n          7.   USDA is acting diligently to complete the administrative steps related to notifying\n\nthe Affected Probationary Employees of their reinstatement, processing the reinstatements for\n\npurposes of all relevant USDA record systems, and returning the reinstated employees to duty\n\nstatus.\n\n\n\n\n                                                      2\n\f       8.      Whether required by operation of the March 5, 2025, MSPB Stay Order and/or this\n\nCourt\u2019s March 13, 2025, Temporary Restraining Order, reinstating the terminated probationary\n\nemployees is complex and places the following logistical burdens on USDA and its approximately\n\n29 subordinate Mission Areas, Agencies, and Staff Offices, including USDA\u2019s multiple human\n\nresources offices: (1) initiating the process of placing all removed probationary employees, who\n\nreceived February 2025 termination letters, into pay status, and providing backpay, from the date\n\nof the termination notice through the present, which involves several systems and applies across\n\nmultiple pay periods; (2) ascertaining whether some of the probationary employees choose to\n\nresign, due to having secured other employment or not wanting to return to duty at USDA; (3)\n\nreinstituting and ensuring operational status of secured LincPasses, office space, and equipment\n\n(including laptops in most instances) for those individuals whose mission criticality requires on-\n\nsite work; and (4) addressing, as appropriate, any identified or substantiated threats to the physical\n\nsafety of USDA\u2019s existing 111,000 person workforce and security of USDA\u2019s physical plants and\n\nassets across the nation.\n\n       Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true\nand correct.\n                                                              Dated: March 17, 2025\n\n                                                                  MARY          Digitally signed\n                                                                                by MARY RICE\n                                                                                Date: 2025.03.17\n                                                              /s/ RICE          18:20:46 -04'00'\n\n                                                              MARY PLETCHER RICE\n\n\n\n\n                                                      3\n\f                           IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n                              FOR THE DISTRICT OF MARYLAND\n\n\n Maryland, et al.,\n\n                                                        Case No. 1:25-cv-00748-JKB\n            Plaintiffs,\n\n            v.\n\n United States Department of Agriculture,\n\n et al.,\n\n            Defendants.\n\n\n                            DECLARATION OF MARK ENGELBAUM\n\n           Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I, Mark Engelbaum declare as follows:\n\n\n           1.      I am the Assistant Secretary for Human Resources and Administration/Operations,\n\nSecurity, and Preparedness at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), headquartered in\n\nWashington, D.C. I make this Declaration based on my own personal knowledge, on information\n\ncontained in the records of the VA, or on information provided to me by VA employees.\n\n           2.      I have served in this position since February 13, 2025. In my role at the VA, I am\n\nresponsible for personnel management. I have the responsibility for overseeing the personnel\n\nenterprise and tracking and recording of personnel actions, including terminations. I assist in\n\nensuring that all personnel actions comply with federal law, including those related to probationary\n\nemployees.\n\n           3.      Probationary employees in the competitive service are employees who have been\n\nemployed for less than one year. In the excepted service, the trial period may be up to two years.\n\f       4.      The probationary period is part of the hiring process, and probationary employees\n\nhave limited protections against termination. The probationary period is essentially an extended\n\ntryout to determine the fitness of the employee and, according to regulation, an agency \u201cshall\n\nterminate his or her services during this period if the employee fails to demonstrate fully his or her\n\nqualifications for continued employment.\u201d\n\n       5.      On January 20, 2025, the VA received a guidance memorandum from the Office of\n\nPersonnel Management (\u201cOPM\u201d), which stated that \u201cagencies should identify all employees on\n\nprobationary periods\u201d and \u201cshould promptly determine whether those employees should be\n\nretained at the agency.\u201d\n\n       6.      VA initially terminated approximately 1,900 probationary employees between\n\nFebruary 13, 2025, and February 24, 2025, out of approximately 46,000 probationary employees\n\non board at VA at that time. Following administrative review, 1,683 remained terminated as of\n\nMarch 17, 2025.\n\n       7.      I have been provided and have reviewed the temporary restraining order (TRO)\n\nissued in this case on March 13, 2025, requiring VA to reinstate all Affected Probationary\n\nEmployees, as defined in paragraph 10(c) of the TRO, who were terminated on or after January\n\n20, 2025.\n\n       8.      Whether required by operation of the TRO here or another court or administrative\n\norder, reinstatement of removed employees to full duty status would impose substantial burdens\n\non VA, cause significant confusion, and cause turmoil for the terminated employees. Specifically,\n\nall employees offered reinstatement into full duty status would have to be onboarded again,\n\nincluding going through any applicable training, filling out human resources paperwork, obtaining\n\nnew security badges, re-enrolling in benefits programs and payroll, reinstituting applicable security\n\n\n\n                                                      2\n\fclearance actions, receiving government furnished equipment, and other requisite administrative\n\nactions, such as auditing personnel requests to ensure any actions that would have otherwise been\n\ntaken during their period of separation are completed.\n\n       9.      Additionally, an appellate ruling could reverse the district court\u2019s order shortly after\n\nterminated employees have been reinstated (via administrative leave or otherwise) or have returned\n\nto full duty status. In short, employees could be subjected to multiple changes in their employment\n\nstatus in a matter of weeks.\n\n       10.     Nonetheless, VA has immediately begun rescinding the notice of termination and\n\nreinstating the employment of the Affected Probationary Employees. While notification efforts are\n\nstill underway, the VA, by 1:00 pm EDT today, Monday, March 17, 2025, has for all intents and\n\npurposes, reinstated all Affected Probationary Employees, placing them in an initial administrative\n\nleave status with full pay and benefits, effective March 17, 2025. Affected Probationary\n\nEmployees will also receive back pay from the date of termination to the date of reinstatement.\n\n       11.     Individual personal contact information is not immediately available for every\n\nindividual employee at the Agency level. Accordingly, as of the signing of this declaration, the\n\nVA has begun sending rescission notices to those employees for whom contact information is\n\navailable as well as to the servicing Human Resources offices of all 1,683 affected Probationary\n\nEmployees. The Human Resources offices are notifying the supervisors of these employees, who\n\nhave been instructed to expeditiously notify the Affected Probationary Employees that they are\n\nreinstated and in a pay status. The Agency will follow up on a daily basis, starting on close of\n\nbusiness Monday, March 17, 2025 until it has received verification that all impacted employees\n\nhave been notified. VA has started the process to cancel the Standard Form (SF) 50s that\n\n\n\n\n                                                      3\n\fterminated the employment of the Affected Probationary Employees and expects this process to\n\nbe completed no later than Tuesday, March 18, 2025.\n\n       12.     VA continues working to reinstate to all Affected Probationary Employees. VA is\n\nengaging the Affected Probationary Employees\u2019 supervisor to ensure employees receive the\n\nnotice, are aware of their employment status, and are advised to maintain contact with their\n\nsupervisor while on administrative leave. The VA is acting diligently to complete additional\n\nadministrative processes related to the reinstatement of these employees.\n\n       Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true\nand correct.\n                                                            Dated: March 17, 2025\n\n\n                                                            /s/Mark Engelbaum 7:05 p.m.\n                                                            Mark Engelbaum\n\n\n\n\n                                                    4\n\f",

GARDNER\n\n           Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I, Johnathan J. Gardner declare as follows:\n\n\n           1.      I am the Acting Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary for Human Capital,\n\nDepartment of Health and Human Services headquartered in Washington, D.C. I make this\n\nDeclaration based on my own personal knowledge, on information contained in the records of the\n\nUnited States Department of Health and Human Services (\u201cHHS\u201d), or on information provided to\n\nme by the Department\u2019s Human Resources Directors.\n\n           2.      I have served in this position since August 12, 2024. In my role at HHS, I am\n\nresponsible for personnel management. I have the responsibility for overseeing the personnel\n\nenterprise and tracking and recording of personnel actions, including terminations. I assist in\n\nensuring that all personnel actions comply with federal law, including those related to probationary\n\nemployees.\n\n           3.      Probationary employees in the competitive service are employees who have been\n\nemployed for less than one year. In the excepted service, the trial period may be up to two years.\n\f        4.       The probationary period is part of the hiring process, and probationary employees\n\nhave limited protections against termination. The probationary period is essentially an extended\n\ntryout to determine the fitness of the employee and, according to regulation, an agency \u201cshall\n\nterminate his or her services during this period if the employee fails to demonstrate fully his or her\n\nqualifications for continued employment.\u201d\n\n        5.       On January 20, 2025, HHS received a guidance memorandum from the Office of\n\nPersonnel Management (\u201cOPM\u201d), which stated that \u201cagencies should identify all employees on\n\nprobationary periods\u201d and \u201cshould promptly determine whether those employees should be\n\nretained at the agency.\u201d\n\n        6.       Between February 14 and March 13, 2025, HHS issued termination notices to 3,248\n\nprobationary and trial period employees out of approximately 8,466 employees serving a\n\nprobationary or trial period under HHS policy.1 HHS placed 2,537 probationary and trial period\n\nemployees on administrative leave through March 14, 2025; HHS also placed 711 remaining\n\nprobationary and trial period employees within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n\n(CDC) on administrative leave with no set end date. However, between February 15 and March\n\n13, 2025, 88 of these 3,248 probationary and trial period employees were subsequently taken off\n\nadministrative leave and terminated before the end of their probationary period.\n\n        7.       I have been provided and have reviewed the temporary restraining order (TRO)\n\nissued in this case on March 13, 2025, requiring HHS to reinstate all Affected Probationary\n\nEmployees, as defined in paragraph 10(c) of the TRO, who were terminated on or after January\n\n20, 2025,\n\n\n1\n  HHS Policy requires all employees to serve a probationary or trial period. However, some of these employees\nmay be entitled to due process if they meet the definition of an employee under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7511(a)(1).\n\n\n\n                                                            2\n\f       8.      Whether required by operation of the TRO here or another court or administrative\n\norder, reinstatement of removed employees to full duty status would impose substantial burdens\n\non HHS, cause significant confusion, and cause turmoil for the terminated employees.\n\nSpecifically, all employees offered reinstatement into full duty status would have to be onboarded\n\nagain, including going through any applicable training, filling out human resources paperwork,\n\nobtaining new security badges, restoring to benefits programs and payroll, receiving government\n\nfurnished equipment, and other requisite administrative actions, such as auditing personnel\n\nrequests to ensure any actions that would have otherwise been taken during their period of\n\nseparation are completed.\n\n       9.      Additionally, an appellate ruling could reverse the district court\u2019s order shortly after\n\nterminated employees have been reinstated or have returned to full duty status. In short, employees\n\ncould be subjected to multiple changes in their employment status in a matter of weeks.\n\n       10.     Nonetheless, HHS has reinstated the Affected Probationary Employees. As of this\n\ntime, HHS has reinstated the 88 Affected Probationary Employees who were terminated before\n\nthe end of their probationary period, between February 15 and March 13, 2025, as described in\n\nparagraph 6, supra. HHS sent notification to all Affected Probationary Employees of their\n\nreinstatement by email or letter on March 17, 2025.\n\n       11.     Further, HHS has placed all reinstated probationary and trial period employees on\n\nadministrative leave. In this regard, HHS has extended the administrative leave status of the 2,855\n\nprobationary and trial period employees who were scheduled to be terminated after March 14,\n\n2025 following the completion of the previously scheduled administrative leave period, as\n\ndescribed in paragraph 6, supra. HHS notes that there is a difference between the number of\n\nAffected Probationary Employees issued termination notices and the number of Affected\n\n\n\n                                                      3\n\fProbationary Employees who were reinstated or had their administrative leave status extended.\n\nSome of this difference reflects the fact that, prior to March 13, 2025, HHS granted exceptions to\n\nallow some Affected Probationary Employees to return to duty. The remainder of this difference\n\nreflects the fact that, prior to March 13, 2025, HHS made a determination that some Affected\n\nProbationary Employees met the definition of an employee under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7511(a)(1) and thus\n\nwere not probationary employees under \u00a7 7511(a)(1), and accordingly, HHS reinstated those\n\nAffected Probationary Employees prior to March 13, 2025. HHS sent notification to all Affected\n\nProbationary Employees of the extension of their administrative leave period, if applicable, by\n\nemail or letter on March 17, 2025.\n\n       12.     By 1:00 pm EDT today, Monday, March 17, 2025, HHS reinstated, or extended the\n\nadministrative leave period for all of the Affected Probationary Employees within HHS, with two\n\nsmall sets of exceptions.\n\n               a.      The first set of Affected Probationary Employees are those who were\n\n       employed at NIH. HHS reinstated or extended the administration leave period for 90% of\n\n       the NIH Affected Probationary Employees by 1:00 pm EDT today. However, during the\n\n       course of this process, NIH experienced technical issues with the relevant personnel\n\n       systems, which resulted in delays completing the reinstatement or extension process. NIH\n\n       completed reinstating or extending the administrative leave period for the remaining 10%\n\n       of Affected Probationary Employees by 1:30 p.m. EDT today.\n\n               b.      The second set of Affected Probationary Employees are those CDC\n\n       employees who were already on administrative leave as of March 13, 2025. Consistent\n\n       with paragraph 6, supra, HHS is maintaining these Affected Probationary Employees on\n\n       administrative leave, with no set end date, in compliance with the TRO.\n\n\n\n                                                    4\n\f       13.     While HHS has notified all Affected Probationary Employees that they have been\n\nreinstated or that their administrative leave status has been extended as applicable, to the extent\n\nHHS needs to complete additional administrative processes related to the reinstatement of these\n\nemployees, HHS is acting diligently to complete such processes.\n\n\n\n       Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true\nand correct.\n                                                            Dated: March 17, 2025\n                                                             JOHNATHAN J.

EDT TO 7 P.M. EDT, MONDAY, MARCH 17, 2025\n\n        Defendants respectfully ask the Court to extend the deadline to file their required Status\n\nReport documenting the actions they have taken to comply with the Court\u2019s Temporary Restraining\n\nOrder (\u201cTRO\u201d) of March 13, 2025 (ECF No. 43) by six (6) hours, from 1 p.m. EDT to 7 p.m. EDT\n\non Monday, March 17, 2025. The Court\u2019s order applies to 18 federal agencies (ECF 44 at 2-3)\n\n(hereinafter \u201cRestrained Defendants\u201d). Defendants do not request to extend the compliance\n\ndeadline set by the TRO, which would remain set for 1 p.m. EDT on Monday, March 17, and ask\n\nonly for modest scheduling relief to permit staggered compliance and Status Report deadlines.\n\nGood cause supports this scheduling relief, which would further the interests of judicial economy\n\nand permit a more orderly, accurate, and comprehensive filing process.\n\n        Since issuance of the TRO at approximately 8:30 p.m. Thursday, March 13, undersigned\n\ncounsel have worked diligently to communicate the TRO\u2019s requirements to Restrained Defendants.\n\nRestrained Defendants, for their part, have worked diligently, with assistance and coordination\n\nfrom undersigned counsel, to comply with those requirements on the deadline established by this\n\nCourt. Those compliance efforts have continued unabated through Saturday and Sunday, March\n\f        Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 49          Filed 03/16/25   Page 2 of 4\n\n\n\n15 and 16, and will continue unabated through working and non-working hours on Monday, March\n\n17, up to and including the 1 p.m. compliance deadline.\n\n       At the same time, it has become apparent to undersigned counsel that modest scheduling\n\nrelief shifting the Status Report deadline back by six hours, to 7 p.m. EDT, would permit a more\n\norderly status report finalization and filing process. It would permit undersigned counsel, with\n\nassistance as necessary from other Department of Justice colleagues, to focus all reasonable efforts\n\non continuing to assist and coordinate with Restrained Defendants in executing and documenting\n\ntheir compliance efforts by 1 p.m., then shift focus to preparing a Status Report that is accurate,\n\ncomprehensive, and up to date with required compliance information. Thus, staggering the two\n\ndeadlines by six hours, while maintaining the 1 p.m. TRO compliance deadline, would serve the\n\ninterests of judicial economy.\n\n       Undersigned counsel conferred with counsel for the State of Maryland regarding this\n\nrequest; counsel provided their consent to this extension so long as Defendants filed the\n\ncompliance Status Report on time under any extended schedule, without regard to any possible\n\nFourth Circuit filings, to which Defendants have agreed. An order granting this modest scheduling\n\nrelief would not prejudice Plaintiffs, as Restrained Defendants would continue all compliance\n\nefforts under the original 1 p.m. EDT compliance deadline, and would simply file the required\n\nStatus Report no later than six hours after that deadline.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  2\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB   Document 49     Filed 03/16/25     Page 3 of 4\n\n\n\n                             Respectfully submitted,\n\n                             YAAKOV ROTH\n                             Acting Assistant Attorney General\n                             Civil Division\n\n                             ERIC J.

Some\nof those rules are intended to help states manage the consequences of sudden, mass layoffs.\nWorkers who unexpectedly lose their jobs often need immediate assistance\u2014in applying for\nunemployment, in searching for new jobs, and in obtaining essential social services\u2014and\nCongress and the government itself recognized as much when they crafted rules meant to give\n\n- States advance notice of big layoffs. Without advance notice and the opportunity to plan, organize,\nand reprogram necessary resources, states are harmed.\n\nIn this case, the government conducted massive layoffs, but it gave no advance notice. It\nclaims it wasn\u2019t required to because, it says, it dismissed each one of these thousands of\nprobationary employees for \u201cperformance\u201d or other individualized reasons. On the record before\nthe Court, this isn\u2019t true. There were no individualized assessments of employees. They were all\njust fired. Collectively. Accordingly, in the language of relevant laws, these big government\nlayoffs were actually \u201cReductions in Force,\u201d or \u201cRIFs.\u201d And, because these were \u201cRIFs,\u201d they\nhad to be preceded by notice to the states that would be impacted.\n\nLacking the notice to which they were entitled, the States weren\u2019t ready for the impact of\nso many unemployed people. They are still scrambling to catch up. They remain impaired in their\ncapacities to meet their legal obligations to their citizens.\n\nBecause the federal government\u2019s recent discharge of thousands of probationary\nemployees was not executed in compliance with rules intended to ensure that states are ready to\n\nbear the load cast upon them when mass layoffs occur, and because the Plaintiff States are not yet\n\fin fact so prepared, and this because of the violations, the recent directives of various federal\nagencies terminating probationary employees must be stayed.\n\nIn the accompanying Temporary Restraining Order, the illegal RIFs are stayed for fourteen\ndays, during which the Court will likely consider an application for a preliminary or longer-term\ninjunction. The Temporary Restraining Order restores the status quo. Employees purportedly\nterminated under the RIFs are returned to the Government\u2019s employ, i.e., they resume the status\n\nthey enjoyed before the Government acted.\n\nIl. INTRODUCTION\n\nPlaintiffs, which include nineteen states and the District of Columbia (\u201cthe States\u201d), have\nfiled suit against forty-one Defendants, which include cabinet agencies and their secretaries, and\nother federal agencies and their heads (\u201cthe Government\u201d). (See generally ECF No. 1.) The States\nchallenge the Government\u2019s termination of probationary federal employees. Plaintiffs have filed\na Motion for Temporary Restraining Order (\u201cTRO\u201d). (ECF No. 4.) The parties have filed briefing\nand evidence in relation to the Motion. (ECF Nos. 4, 5, 19, 20, 33.) The Court held a Hearing on\nthe Motion on March 12, 2025. The Motion will be granted, and a TRO will issue.\nil. BACKGROUND\n\nA. Requirements for Terminating Probationary Employees\n\nIn the federal civil service, most employees are considered to be under probationary status\nin the first year or two of their employment. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3321(a), 7511(a)(1)(A)Gi),\n\n7511(a)(1)(C)(ii); 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.801. A probationary employee may be terminated \u201cbecause his\n\fwork performance or conduct during this period fails to demonstrate his fitness or his qualifications\nfor continued employment,\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.804, or \u201cfor reasons based in whole or in part on\nconditions arising before his appointment,\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.805. If a probationary employee is\nterminated because his performance or conduct fails to demonstrate that he is fit for continued\nemployment, the agency \u201cshall terminate his services by notifying him in writing as to why he is\nbeing separated and the effective date of the action. The information in the notice as to why the\nemployee is being terminated shall, as a minimum, consist of the agency\u2019s conclusions as to the\ninadequacies of his performance or conduct.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.804. Otherwise, a probationary\nemployee may be terminated as part of a reduction in force (\u201cRIF\u201d). The parties have not identified\nany other method by which a probationary employee may be terminated.\n\nWith respect to a RIF, federal statutes and regulations set forth detailed procedures that\nfederal agencies must follow. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502; 5 C.F.R. Part 351. The relevant regulations\nprovide that \u201c[e]ach agency shall follow this part when it releases a competing employee from his\nor her competitive level by . . . separation . . . , when the release is required because of lack of\nwork; shortage of funds; insufficient personnel ceiling; reorganization; the exercise of\nreemployment rights or restoration rights; or reclassification of an employee\u2019s position die [sic] to\nerosion of duties when such action will take effect after an agency has formally announced a\nreduction in force in the employee\u2019s competitive area and when the reduction in force will take\neffect within 180 days.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.201(a)(2).\n\nWhen conducting a RIF, an agency must follow certain retention preferences, as laid out\nin the statute and regulations. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(a) (directing the Office of Personnel\nManagement (\u201cOPM\u201d) to \u201cprescribe regulations for the release of competing employees in a\n\nreduction in force which give due effect to (1) tenure of employment; (2) military preference .. . ;\n\f(3) length of service; and (4) efficiency or performance ratings.\u201d); 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.501 (providing\nthat \u201c[c]ompeting employees shall be classified on a retention register on the basis of their tenure\nof employment, veteran preference, length of service, and performance\u201d based upon group\ndesignations). Probationary employees are included in \u201cgroup II\u201d and may only be released after\nthe release of \u201cgroup III\u201d employees, which includes certain temporary and term employees. 5\nC.F.R. \u00a7 351.501 (a), (b).\n\nIn addition, when conducting a RIF, a federal agency must:\n\nestablish \u201ccompetitive areas! in which employees compete for retention\u201d; designate\nthe \u201ccompetitive areas\u201d of which employees are to compete for retention at least 90\ndays before the effective date of the RIF; designate any \u201ccompetitive levels\u201d of\npositions included in the RIFs that would permit the agency to reassign retained\nemployees without causing undue interruption; and rank employees for retention\nbased on factors including their tenure group, time in service (including military\nservice), veteran preference, length of service, and performance.\n\n(ECF No. 1 \u00a7 92 (citing 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(a); 5 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 351.402-351.404, 351.504).)\n\nFurther, federal agencies are required to provide at least 60 days written notice before they\nmay release a federal employee. Ifthe RIF is caused by unforeseeable circumstances, \u201cthe Director\nof OPM, at the request of an agency head or designee, may approve a notice period of less than 60\ndays.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.801(b). \u201cThe shortened notice period must cover at least 30 full days before\nthe effective date of release.\u201d Jd.\n\nThat notice must be provided to (1) the employee; (2) the employee\u2019s collective bargaining\nrepresentative; and\u2014if the RIF involves at least 50 employees within a \u201ccompetitive area\u201d\u2014(3)\n\nthe state in which the employee\u2019s duty station was located. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d); 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.803.\n\n'\u201cA competitive area must be defined solely in terms of the agency\u2019s organizational unit(s) and geographical location\nand . . . it must include all employees within the competitive area so defined. A competitive area may consist of all\nor part of an agency. The minimum competitive area is a subdivision of the agency under separate administration\nwithin the local commuting area.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.402(b).\n\fThe notice must be provided to \u201c[t]he State or the entity designated by the State to carry\nout rapid response activities under Title I of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7\n351.803. That notice must include: \u201c(1) The number of employees to be separated from the agency\nby reduction in force (broken down by geographic area or other basis specified by OPM); (2) The\neffective date of the separations; and (3) Any other information specified by OPM, including\ninformation needs identified from consultation between OPM and the Department of Labor to\nfacilitate delivery of placement and related services.\u201d /d.\n\nWhen an agency fails to provide the requisite notice to the State, the \u201cemployee may not\nbe released, due to a reduction in force[.|\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d)(1).\n\nThe States, in turn, are required to carry out \u201crapid response activities\u201d pursuant to the\nWorkforce Innovation and Opportunity Act of 2014.7 See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 682.302 (\u201cRapid response\nmust be delivered when\u201d there is, inter alia, \u201c[a|nnouncement or notification of a mass layoff as\ndefined in \u00a7 682.305.\u201d); see also 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 682.305 (defining \u201cmass layoff\u201d as one that \u201cmeets\nthe State\u2019s definition of mass layoff, as long as the definition does not exceed a minimum threshold\nof 50 affected workers\u201d or, \u201c[w]here a State has not defined a minimum threshold for mass layoff\nmeeting the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, layoffs affecting 50 or more workers\u201d).\n\n\u201cRapid response activity\u201d is defined as the activities provided by the state in response to a\nmass layoff \u201cin order to assist dislocated workers in obtaining reemployment as soon as possible,\nwith services including\u201d \u201cthe establishment of onsite contact with employers and employee\nrepresentatives\u201d; \u201cthe provision of information on and access to available employment and training\n\n99, 66.\n\nactivities\u201d; \u201cthe provision of emergency assistance\u201d; and \u201cassistance to the local community in\n\n2 The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act of 2014 succeeded the Workforce Investment Act of 1998. See 29\nU.S.C. \u00a7 3361(a) (\u201cExcept as otherwise specified, a reference in a Federal law to a provision of the Workforce\nInvestment Act of 1998 (29 U.S.C. 2801 et seq.) shall be deemed to refer to the corresponding provision of [the\nWorkforce Innovation and Opportunity Act of 2014].\u201d).\n\fdeveloping a coordinated response and in obtaining access to State economic development.\u201d 29\nU.S.C. \u00a7 3102(51). These rapid-response services are designed to cushion the blow of sudden\nmass unemployment. See, e.g.,20C.F.R. \u00a7 682.100 (providing that the Workplace Innovation and\nOpportunity Act (\u201cWIOA\u201d) designates \u201cboth required and allowable activities\u201d); id \u00a7 682.200\n(identifying \u201c[rJequired statewide... activities,\u201d including \u201crapid response activities\u201d); id.\n\u00a7 682.300(a) (defining \u201crapid response\u201d as \u201cencompass|ing] the strategies and activities necessary\nto,\u201d among other things, \u201c[d]eliver services to enable dislocated workers to transition to new\nemployment as quickly as possible\u201d). These federal duties stand alongside the States\u2019 own,\njurisdiction-specific requirements related to mass unemployment events. See, e.g., Md. Code\nAnn., Lab. & Empl. \u00a7\u00a7 11-303 to \u201404 (setting out Maryland\u2019s \u201cquick response program,\u201d whose\nduties include \u201cmonitor[ing] layoff and employment patterns and payments of unemployment\ncompensation contributions to identify employers that are likely to experience large losses in\nemployment or a reduction in operations\u201d); N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 34:21-5 (setting out New Jersey\u2019s\n\u201cresponse team,\u201d whose duties include, among others, \u201c[s]eek[ing] to facilitate cooperation\nbetween [management and employees] to most effectively utilize available public programs which\nmay make it possible to delay or prevent the transfer or termination of operations\u201d); (see generally\nECF No. 4-1 at 16-17). Finally, the States also hold background obligations to provide\nunemployment and similar benefits. See generally, e.g., Md. Code Ann., Lab. & Empl. \u00a7\u00a7 8-101\nto -1608; N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 43:21\u20141 to -71.\n\nB. The Government\u2019s Alleged Actions\n\nOn February 11, 2025, President Trump issued Executive Order 14210, \u201cImplementing the\nPresident\u2019s \u2018Department of Government Efficiency\u2019 Workforce Optimization Initiative.\u201d It set out\n\nas its purpose, \u201c[b]y eliminating waste, bloat, and insularity, my Administration will empower\n\fAmerican families, workers, taxpayers, and our system of Government itself.\u201d It provides, inter\nalia, that \u201cAgency Heads shall promptly undertake preparations to initiate large-scale reductions\nin force (RIFs), consistent with applicable law, and to separate from Federal service temporary\nemployees and reemployed annuitants working in areas that will likely be subject to the RIFs.\u201d\n\nOn February 11 and 12, various agencies terminated large numbers of probationary\nemployees. (ECF No. 1 4 107-109.)\n\nThe States allege that, on February 13, \u201cOPM officials met with agency officials\nthroughout the federal government and ordered agencies to lay off nearly all of the federal\ngovernment\u2019s approximately 220,000 probationary employees.\u201d (Jd. 4110.) And, in a February\n14 email, Plaintiffs allege that OPM explained to agencies that \u201c[w]e have asked that you separate\nprobationary employees that you have not identified as mission critical no later than the end of the\nday Monday, 2/27. We have attached a template letter. The separation date should be as soon as\npossible that is consistent with applicable agency policies (including those in CBAs).\u201d (/d. 112.)\n\nThis was followed by several more agencies terminating large numbers of probationary\nemployees on February 13 through March 3. (/d. \u00a7{\u00a7 115-137.)\n\nAll told, the States allege that the Government has terminated at least 24,000 probationary\nemployees. (/d. \u00a7 139.) The States were not provided any notice of such terminations from the\nrelevant agencies. (/d. 4 148.)\n\nCc, The States\u2019 Alleged Harms\n\nThe States allege several injuries resulting from the Government\u2019s failure to follow the RIF\nprocedures. They situate these injuries within five distinct categories of harm: (1) harms to the\nStates\u2019 rapid-response protocols, which both federal and state law require the States to develop,\n\n(see ECF No. 4-1 at 21-22, 33-34; ECF No. 19 at 2-3); (2) harms to the States\u2019 administration of\n\funemployment benefits, (see ECF No. 4-1 at 21-22, 34-35; ECF No. 19 at 2\u20143); (3) harms to State\nprograms that rely on embedded federal workers, (see ECF No. 4-1 at 36-37; ECF No. 19 at 3);\n(4) harms to the States\u2019 finances, namely, the States\u2019 tax bases and various social-services\nprograms, including public health insurance, (see ECF No. 4-1 at 23, 37-38; ECF No. 19 at 4\u20145);\nand (5) an informational harm that attends the fact of not having received the statutorily required\nnotice, (see ECF No. 4-1 at 23, 24; ECF No. 19 at 5-6).\n\nFirst, the States allege harms to their rapid-response efforts by virtue of having to \u201cdivert[]\nor... prepar[e] to divert staff from critical state-funded matters.\u201d (ECF No. 19 at 2.) They also\nallege harms in the form of \u201cadministrative burdens [flowing from] the need to affirmatively\ncontact federal agencies, monitor public reporting, and conduct mass outreach to identify impacted\nworkers,\u201d (id. at 2\u20143 (citations omitted)), as well as to \u201cdetermine if additional firings will occur\u201d\nand \u201cattempt to provide services to those employees,\u201d (ECF No. 4-1 at 22 (collecting affidavits\nfrom State labor officials)). For example, the State of Maryland \u201ccreated a new website, requiring\nsignificant time and expense,\u201d in order to provide resources to recently terminated federal\nemployees. (ECF No. 4-5 \u00a7 29.) In the States\u2019 telling, these recent costs exceed those they would\nhave incurred with proper notice under the RIF statute. (See, e.g, ECF No. 4-5 \u00a7 21-22\n(Maryland Secretary of Labor asserting that \u201c[rJeacting after a layoff is far more resource-intensive\nthan the advance planning and assistance process required by law,\u201d and that \u201c[b]ecause the [State]\nhas received no notice of federal RIFs, despite extensive outreach, [it is] dedicating significantly\nmore staff, resources, and expenditures to fulfill [its] statutory obligation\u201d).)\n\nSecond, the States allege harms to their unemployment-benefits systems as a direct result\nof a surge in the number of claims brought by former federal employees. (See ECF No. 4-1 at 21\u2014\n\n22; 32-38.) The States offer the following numbers, among others:\n\fe Between January 21 and March 3, 2025, Maryland received claims from 813 former\nfederal employees, up 330 percent from the 189 such claims it received during the same\nperiod the prior year. (See ECF No. 4-5 {\u00a7 50, 52.) In \u201cthe last few weeks,\u201d the State\nhas received 30 to 60 new claims per day. (/d. \u00a7 18.)\n\ne Between February | and March 4, 2025, California received claims from 1,621 former\nfederal employees, up 149 percent from the 650 such claims it received during the same\nperiod the prior year. (See ECF No. 4-7 4 30.)\n\ne Between January 19 and March 1, 2025, Illinois received claims from 446 former\nfederal employees, just seven fewer than the 453 such claims it received during the\nentire 2024 calendar year. (See ECF 4-8 \u00a7\u00a7 15-16.)\n\ne Between January 21 and February 26, 2025, New Jersey received claims from 388\nformer federal employees, up 273 percent from the 104 such claims it received during\nthe same period the prior year. (See ECF No. 4-11 4 14-15.)\n\ne Between January 21 and February 27, 2025, New York received claims from 550\nformer federal employees, a \u201csignificant increase\u201d from prior numbers. (See ECF No.\n4-13 4 4.)\n\ne In February 2025, Massachusetts received claims from 251 former federal employees,\nwith a \u201csignificant uptick\u201d in the latter weeks of that period, including 32 claims on\nFebruary 24 alone. (ECF No. 4-9 4 16-17.)\n\nBecause of these increases in claims, the States say they \u201care experiencing administrative burdens\nand costs,\u201d including costs related to the processing of numerous additional claims. (ECF No. 19\nat 3 (citing ECF No. 4-5 4] 37-38, 73-74 (describing how, in Maryland, state money makes up\nfor any federal shortfalls in unemployment-related funding)); see also ECF No. 4-5 4 59, 70\n(identifying Maryland\u2019s added costs not only in processing claims, but in verifying them, especially\ngiven scant information about the firings).) And the States fear \u201c[t]his surge is only beginning,\u201d\ngiven that \u201cthe effective dates for some terminations have not yet passed\u201d and \u201cthere will [also] be\na delay between when individuals are fired and when they likely apply for benefits.\u201d (See ECF\nNo. 4-1 at 21.)\n\nBeyond the increased burdens on unemployment-benefits services and the ability to fulfill\ntheir rapid-response duties, the States separately \u201canticipate increased costs to the agencies that\nenroll new participants in Medicaid and other health-benefits programs.\u201d (ECF No. 4-1 at 36.) In\n\nthat context, the expected harms stem from circumstances substantially similar to those described\n\fabove: a bevy of new and otherwise avoidable administrative tasks, including \u201c[flielding questions\nfrom terminated employees, processing an unexpected influx of applications, and providing other\nhealth-benefits services.\u201d (See id.)\n\nThird, \u201c[s]ome Plaintiff States have also lost the benefit of services provided by federal\nemployees embedded within state agencies, without any time to prepare.\u201d (ECF No. | \u00a7 6.) In\nNew Jersey and Rhode Island, for example, federal employees working in the Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention (\u201cCDC\u201d)\u2019s Public Health Associate Program (\u201cPHAP\u201d) are embedded in\nstate health agencies. (See ECF No. 4-12 45; ECF No. 4-15 4 7.) In New Jersey, three PHAP\nassociates, all of whom working on infectious disease tracing, were terminated. (ECF No. 4-12\n4,11.) CDC later reinstated the associates, but one of the three elected not to return. (/d.) New\nJersey was \u201cunable to prepare for the sudden loss of labor it was relying on to perform crucial\npublic health services,\u201d and, because the associates\u2019 caseloads had to be transferred without any\nnotice to staffers who already had full caseloads, there were \u201cadministrative inefficiencies,\nduplicative work, and most importantly, delayed notifications to persons exposed to syphilis, HIV,\nand TB, which in turn increased the risk of spreading disease in New Jersey.\u201d (/d. \u00a7 13.) Plaintiffs\nprovide similar evidence for Rhode Island, where two PHAP associates were terminated but then\nreinstated. (See generally ECF No. 4-15.)\n\nFourth, the States allege that the Government\u2019s actions \u201cwill continue to cause irreparable\nharm to Plaintiff States\u2019 tax base.\u201d (ECF No. 4-1 at 37.) According to the Comptroller of\nMaryland, for example, \u201c[a]lthough unemployed individuals receiving unemployment benefits\ngenerally pay income tax on their benefits, the benefits paid are less than the amount the\nindividuals earned when they were fully employed, and therefore the taxes paid are generally less\n\nthan the taxes paid during their employment.\u201d (ECF No. 4-38 \u00a7 5.) She further attests that\n\n10\n\f\u201chundreds\u201d of Maryland federal employees have been recently terminated and applied for\nunemployment benefits, which will ultimately result in \u201csignificant decreases in Maryland\u2019s\nincome tax revenues.\u201d (Jd. {| 7-8.) Plaintiffs also rely on the analysis of Terry Clower, a public\npolicy professor at George Mason University. (ECF No. 4-35.) Dr. Clower estimates that \u201cthe\ntermination of 1,000 federal workers in the District [of Columbia] would, over a period of 60 days,\nreduce the District\u2019s income tax revenues by $320,914 and sales tax revenues by $57,942.\u201d (/d. \u00a7\n9.) If the number of terminated employees was 50,000, then the reductions in income and sales\ntax revenues would be approximately $16 million and just under $3 million,\nrespectively. (/d.) Moreover, Dr. Clower estimates that, if fired workers are given the opportunity\nto find alternative employment, the tax losses to the District would be significantly lower, (id. {\n12); the States contend that this analysis shows that \u201c[h]ad the District received the notice required\nby law, these losses would likely have been mitigated, including because some employees would\nhave been able to obtain alternative employment prior to their termination.\u201d (ECF No. 4-1 at 37\u2014\n38.)\n\nFifth, the States allege a \u201ctextbook informational injury\u201d because of the Government\u2019s\nfailure to provide information about RIFs as required by law. (ECF No. 19 at 5.) The States\nassert\u2014and the Government does not deny\u2014that the Government did not provide any advance\nnotice that it was conducting RIFs, nor did it provide \u201cinformation as to the location and\ncircumstances of future RIFs\u201d as required under federal law. (/d (citing 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\n\n3502(d)(3)(A)(i); 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.803(b)(1).)\n\n11\n\fIV. REVIEWABILITY\n\nThe Court first examines whether it may review the actions at issue. It concludes that the\nStates\u2014or at least some subset of them\u2014have standing, that there were reviewable final agency\nactions, and that Thunder Basin does not preclude review.\n\nA. Justiciability\n\nArticle III of the Constitution limits the judicial power of the federal courts to the resolution\nof \u201cCases\u201d and \u201cControversies.\u201d U.S. Const., art. III, \u00a7 2, cl. 1. The law has long understood this\nlanguage to limit the judiciary to settling \u201cgenuine, live dispute[s] between adverse parties, thereby\npreventing the federal courts from issuing advisory opinions.\u201d Laufer v. Naranda Hotels, LLC, 60\nF.4th 156, 161 (4th Cir. 2023) (quoting Carney v. Adams, 592 U.S. 53, 58 (2020)). When a dispute\ndoes not fit that description, it is considered nonjusticiable, see Babbitt v. United Farm Workers\nNat'l Union, 442 U.S. 289, 297 (1979), and the federal courts lack subject-matter jurisdiction to\ndecide it. See Hamilton v. Pallozzi, 848 F.3d 614, 620-21 (4th Cir. 2017) (citation omitted).\n\nAn \u201cessential and unchanging part\u201d of the case-or-controversy limitation is the requirement\nof standing. Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992). The standing inquiry is often\ncast as asking \u201cwhether the plaintiff is the proper party to bring th[e] suit.\u201d Raines v. Byrd, 521\nU.S. 811, 818 (1997). By ensuring, among other things, that plaintiffs seek relief from only those\nacts that affect them in a definite and distinct way, the standing doctrine \u201censures that federal\ncourts decide only \u2018the rights of individuals,\u2019\u201d TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 594 U.S. 413, 424\n(2021) (quoting Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. 137, 170 (1803)), and therefore exercise only \u201ctheir\nproper function in a limited and separated government,\u201d id. (citation omitted). \u201cSuch scrutiny is\nnecessary to filter the truly afflicted from the abstractly distressed.\u201d Friends of the Earth, Inc. v.\n\nGaston Copper Recycling Corp., 204 F.3d 149, 154 (4th Cir. 2000).\n\n12\n\fTo establish standing, a plaintiff must show (1) a \u201cconcrete, particularized, and actual or\nimminent\u201d injury in fact; (2) that the injury \u201cwas likely caused by the defendant\u201d; and (3) that the\ninjury \u201cwould likely be redressed by judicial relief.\u201d TransUnion, 594 U.S. at 423 (citing Lujan,\n504 U.S. at 560-61). \u201cIf the plaintiff does not claim to have suffered an injury that the defendant\ncaused and the court can remedy, there is no case or controversy for the federal court to resolve.\u201d\nid, (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Casillas v. Madison Ave. Assocs., Inc., 926 F.3d\n329, 333 (7th Cir. 2019) (Barrett, J.)).\n\nHere, the States have demonstrated each of the fundamental elements of standing, such that\nthey are entitled to invoke federal jurisdiction over their claims. The Court addresses each element\nin turn.\n\nI. Injury in Fact\n\nThe States assert five categories of injury: (1) increased administrative costs associated\nwith the hasty rollout of rapid-response protocols, (2) increased administrative costs related to the\nburden the dismissals have placed on their unemployment-benefits programs, (3) the loss of the\nservices of embedded federal employees, (4) financial harms by way of decreased tax revenue and\nincreased public health insurance payouts, and (5) informational harms in the form of not receiving\nnotice they had a strong interest in receiving (an argument supported by the foregoing, allegedly\navoidable harms). See supra Section I.C.\n\nAs an initial matter, for analytical purposes, the Court views these injuries differently than\nthe States do. As the States themselves observed at the TRO hearing, the \u201ccentral injury\u201d in this\ncase is fundamentally informational: the States were not given statutorily required notice of the\nGovernment\u2019s RIFs. For that reason, the other four categories of harm are most naturally\n\nunderstood not as standalone injuries, but as harms flowing from the lack of notice. After all, had\n\n13\n\fnotice been provided, those other injuries\u2014at least as the States describe them\u2014would not have\nmaterialized. Accordingly, the Court considers the States to assert just one injury, not five.\n\nThat does not mean, however, that the other categories of injury are irrelevant\u2014far from\nit. This is because of what is required to establish an informational injury under Article III.\n\nInformational injury has long been recognized as a valid injury in fact. See, e.g., Laufer,\nLLC, 60 F.4th at 163 (collecting cases). And while courts have, from time to time, enforced limits\non the justiciability of claims arising from informational harms\u2014often in the context of whether\nsuch harms were sufficiently \u201cconcrete,\u201d see, e.g., TransUnion, 594 U.S. at 441-42; Fernandez v.\nRentGrow, Inc., 116 F.4th 288, 300 (4th Cir. 2024)\u2014they have always been open to plaintiffs who\n(1) did not receive information they were legally entitled to receive and, as a result, (2) experienced\n\u201ca \u2018real\u2019 harm with an adverse effect.\u201d See Dreher v. Experian Info. Sols., Inc., 856 F.3d 337, 345\n(4th Cir. 2017) (quoting Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 578 U.S. 330, 340 (2016)); see also TransUnion,\n594 U.S. at 442 (observing that there must be \u201c\u2018downstream consequences\u2019 from failing to\nreceive .. . required information\u201d (citation omitted)).\n\nThe States\u2019 asserted informational injury satisfies these requirements. First, the plain text\nof the relevant statutes and regulations makes clear that the States were legally entitled to notice\nof an imminent RIF. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d)(3)(A); 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.803(b). Not only that, but the\nnotice had to contain certain information. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d)(3)(B); 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.803(c).\nNowhere does the Government dispute the States\u2019 interest on this score\u2014not in its briefing, nor\nduring the TRO hearing.\n\nSecond, the States have incurred substantial follow-on harms as a result of the\nGovernment\u2019s failure to provide the required RIF notice. Chief among these are the increased\n\nburdens associated with the States\u2019 flat-footed rollout of rapid-response and unemployment-\n\n14\n\fbenefits programs. (See, e.g., ECF No. 4-5 \u00a7\u00a7 27, 58 (describing costs and delays associated with\ndiverting Maryland personnel); ECF No. 4-8 \u00a7 24 (similar, but for Illinois).) To fulfill their legal\nobligation to provide these services, the States have had to divert money and human resources\nfrom existing purposes to new ones\u2014and, because of the lack of notice, have done so less\nefficiently than they would otherwise have. That is enough for standing. After all, even on their\nown, monetary losses are \u201cobvious\u201d concrete harms, see, e.g., TransUnion, 594 U.S. 413 at 425,\nsuch that they are also undeniably \u201creal\u201d for purposes of informational injury. The same must be\ntrue of the diversion and/or loss of various employees\u2019 services, whether this stems from internal\nemployees being reassigned or embedded ones disappearing; the Court presumes employees are\nhired for and placed according to the value they provide\u2014and, accordingly, that departure or\nplacement into another role, even temporarily, constitutes (at least) a financial loss.\n\nThe Court reaches the same conclusion, albeit on somewhat shakier ground, with respect\nto the increased costs associated with a surge in payouts of unemployment claims and other various\npublic benefits. The question for these harms is not, of course, whether they are \u201cconcrete\u201d; they\nare, for the same reasons as the financial and labor harms inflicted upon the States\u2019 capacity to run\ntheir rapid-response and unemployment-benefits programs. The question, rather, is whether they\nare sufficiently \u201cactual or imminent.\u201d\n\nOn balance, the Court believes they are. Future harm is enough for standing when \u201cthe\nthreatened injury is certainly impending, or there is a substantial risk that the harm will occur.\u201d\nDep't of Com. v. New York, 588 U.S. 752, 767 (2019) (quoting Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus,\n573 U.S. 149, 158 (2014)). And here, the analysis is straightforward: mass layoffs lead to large\nnumbers of unemployed people, and large numbers of unemployed people lead to an increase in\n\nthe number of unemployment claims. At this early stage, that is enough, even in view of the fact\n\n15\n\fthat not every terminated employee will file for unemployment, and that not every employee who\ndoes so will be successful. After all, the States have already shown an increase in the number of\nbenefits claims coming from former federal employees. And the courts have repeatedly endorsed\nsimilar theories of future injury. See, e.g., Dep't of Com., 588 U.S. at 766-67 (approving standing\ntheory based on \u201cdiminishment of political representation, loss of federal funds, degradation of\ncensus data, and diversion of resources\u201d due to expected nonresponses to modified census); Texas\nv. United States, 809 F.3d 134, 155 (5th Cir. 2015) (holding a State to have standing to challenge\na federal immigration law based on the costs of issuing a greater number of driver\u2019s licenses), aff'd\nby an equally divided court, 579 U.S. 547 (2016); State v. Biden, 10 F.4th 538, 547 (5th Cir. 2021)\n(holding a State to have standing because it \u201cincurs a cost every time it inquires into whether\n[someone] satisfies the requirements for a license\u201d (emphasis in original)). Even so, the Court\nnotes the infirmity inherent in all theories of future injury, particularly those that rely on the\nanticipated behavior of third parties. See, e.g., Clapper v. Amnesty Int'l USA, 568 U.S. 398, 414\n(2013) (expressing \u201creluctance to endorse standing theories that rest on speculation about the\ndecisions of independent actors\u201d).\n\nThe only injury the States assert that does nof readily present an \u201cactual or imminent\u201d\ndownstream harm is the loss of tax revenue. The question of when a state or municipality has\nstanding to sue on the grounds that a challenged federal action will reduce its tax revenue is a\nsomewhat unsettled one. On the one hand, it has long been held that a State cannot establish\nstanding by positing a chain of events flowing from the Government\u2019s actions that could eventually\nlead to decreased tax revenue flowing into the general treasury. See Florida v. Mellon, 273 U.S.\n12, 17-18 (1927) (rejecting as \u201cpurely speculative, and, at most, only remote and indirect\u201d the\n\nclaim that a challenged act \u201cwill have the result of inducing potential taxpayers to withdraw\n\n16\n\fproperty from the state, thereby diminishing the subjects upon which the state power of taxation\nmay operate\u201d). On the other, a State may be able to establish standing when a challenged action\nwill cause a \u201cdirect injury in the form of a loss of specific tax revenues.\u201d Wyoming v. Oklahoma,\n502 U.S. 437, 448 (1992). The Courts of Appeals are split as to how broadly Wyoming should be\nread, compare Sierra Club v. Trump, 977 F.3d 853, 870-71 (9th Cir. 2020), judgment vacated on\nother grounds sub nom. Biden v. Sierra Club, 142 S. Ct. 56 (2021), with El Paso County v. Trump,\n982 F.3d 332, 339-41 (Sth Cir. 2020), and it does not appear that the Fourth Circuit has opined on\nthe matter.\n\nHere, reasonable minds could differ as to whether the States\u2019 position places it closer to\nthe plaintiff in Florida or in Wyoming. The States\u2019 fears of a general \u201csignificant decline in tax\nreceipts\u201d as a result of economic pressures engendered by the terminations is likely too diffuse of\nan injury to be cognizable. (ECF No. 19 at 4-5.) The States come closer to the mark, however, in\npresenting evidence that the State of Maryland will likely suffer significant lost income tax revenue\nas a result of the Government\u2019s terminations, because individuals receiving unemployment\nbenefits pay lower income taxes than those who are fully employed. (ECF No. 4-38 (Declaration\nof the Comptroller of Maryland).) But whether this loss is sufficiently directly tied to the RIFs is\nunclear.\n\nWeaknesses in certain theories aside, the Court is satisfied that the States have shown an\ninjury in fact based on informational harm. The States have already incurred appreciable financial\nand labor costs as a direct result of not receiving notice they were owed, and they will certainly\nincur additional costs in the future related to the increased payout of public benefits. And the Court\nis unpersuaded by the Government\u2019s argument, reiterated throughout the TRO hearing, that each\n\nof these costs is \u201cdownstream\u201d and therefore not cognizable under Article III. As the Supreme\n\n17\n\fCourt has made clear, a \u201creal,\u201d downstream harm is a critical component of an informational\ninjury\u2014hardly a circumstance that destroys one. See, e.g., TransUnion, 594 U.S. at 442; see also\nDreher, 856 F.3d at 345 (citing Spokeo, 578 U.S. at 340). For that reason, particularly in this\nexpedited posture, the Court need not say definitively which theories of injury ought not survive\nfor the duration of the litigation; at least one valid theory is enough.?\n\nThe Court is also unmoved by the Government\u2019s appeal to what it calls \u201cthe extraordinary\nbreadth of the States\u2019 suit,\u201d an argument the Government appears to raise in support of its view\nthat the States have not identified a particularized injury. (See ECF No. 20 at 13-14.)\n\nTo buttress this argument, the Government likens this action to Murthy v. Missouri, in\nwhich several plaintiff states\u2014all of which had sought a preliminary injunction barring federal\nofficials from pressuring social media platforms to suppress free speech\u2014were held to lack\nstanding. 603 U.S. 43 (2024). True, this case, like Murthy, is a \u201csprawling\u201d suit in which \u201cdozens\nof Executive Branch officials and agencies\u201d have been sued. /d. at 49,61. But while massive and\nunusual suits may legitimately invite closer judicial scrutiny than more run-of-the-mill ones, there\nis of course no per se rule that such actions are impermissible.\n\nAnd besides, the scale of the two suits is where the similarities between this case and\nMurthy end. In Murthy, the crux of the standing problem was twofold: First, the plaintiffs could\nnot establish that any harm\u2014suppression of free speech protected by the First Amendment\u2014was\nfairly traceable to the governmental defendants, rather than to the (nonparty) social media\n\nplatforms who actually made the decision to restrict their speech. 603 U.S. at 62-68. Second, in\n\n> For similar reasons, and in light of the fact that the Court would order nationwide relief even if just a single State\nhad standing to press these claims, see infra Section IV.B, the Court need not determine which States, if any, do not\nhave standing to go the distance in this action. For the limited purposes of this TRO, it is enough for one State to be\nable to invoke the jurisdiction of this Court. The Court is satisfied that at least some subset of the States\u2014namely,\nMaryland\u2014has done so.\n\n18\n\fMurthy the plaintiffs sought prospective relief against future alleged suppression campaigns, but\nthere was no evidence that the government was continuing its alleged pressure campaign or was\nlikely to do so in the future. /d. at 68-72. This case is completely different. First, unlike in\nMurthy, where only prospective relief was sought and it was doubtful that plaintiffs would suffer\nany future injuries, here the harm is happening right now, and can only be remedied by immediate\ninjunctive relief. More fundamentally, unlike in Murthy, the alleged chain of causation does not\ndepend upon the actions of third parties not before the Court. Instead, the allegations are simply\nthat the Government failed to provide the States information to which they are statutorily entitled,\nand that because of this failure States have been forced to expend resources that they would not\notherwise have had to expend. This distinction also goes to redressability. In Murthy, it was not\nclear how a favorable court order would redress the injuries claimed, as nothing in the order would\nprevent the nonparty social media platforms from continuing to suppress the plaintiffs\u2019 speech. /d.\nat 73-74 (\u201c[T]he platforms remain free to enforce, or not to enforce, those policies\u2014even those\ntainted by initial governmental coercion. The platforms are not parties to the suit, and there is no\nreason they should be obliged to honor an incidental legal determination the suit produced.\u201d\n(cleaned up)). Such concerns are simply not at issue here.\n2. Causation\n\nTo start, it is plain that at least some of the harms the States have experienced\u2014namely,\nthe increase in the cost of administering certain state programs, irrespective of what those programs\nwill be required to pay out\u2014are direct and foreseeable results of the agencies\u2019 failures to provide\nRIF notices. The Government does not argue otherwise. (See ECF No. 20 at 12-17.) Accordingly,\non that basis alone, the Court is confident there is no causation defect that would wholly defeat the\n\nStates\u2019 standing.\n\n19\n\fAs for the harms based on the expected increase in public benefits awards and future lost\ntax revenues, the Government argued during the TRO hearing that these harms were self-inflicted.\nThe Court disagrees. Costs that States incur in the satisfaction of a mandatory legal duty, even\none arising under state law, are not self-inflicted. See, e.g., Texas, 809 F.3d at 155. And here,\nlegal duties arise under both federal and state law. See, e.g.,20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 682.100\u2014.300 (providing\ncertain duties under the Workplace Innovation and Opportunity Act); Md. Code Ann., Lab. &\nEmpl. \u00a7\u00a7 11-303 to \u201404 (setting out Maryland\u2019s \u201cquick response program\u201d with respect to mass\nunemployment events); N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 34:21-5 (similar, but for New Jersey).\n\nCausation is also not defeated by certain theories\u2019 reliance on the anticipated behavior of\nthird parties. This element is satisfied when \u201cthird parties will likely react in predictable ways to\nthe\u201d conduct at issue. See Dep't of Com., 588 U.S. at 768. For much the same reason the States\u201d\nappeal to future increased benefits payouts was \u201cactual or imminent\u201d for purposes of injury in fact,\nthat harm is traceable to the Government\u2019s terminations: mass layoffs mean more unemployed\npeople, more unemployed people means more unemployment claims. That is textbook\npredictability.\n\n3; Redressability\n\nFinally, the States have shown their harms to be redressable by the relief sought. To satisfy\nthis element, \u201cit must be \u2018likely,\u2019 as opposed to merely \u2018speculative,\u2019 that the injury will be\n\u2018redressed by a favorable decision.\u201d Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561 (quoting Simon v. Eastern Ky. Welfare\nRights Org., 426 U.S. 26, 38, 43 (1976)).\n\nAs established above, the States\u2019 injuries were caused by the lack of RIF notice. That\ncircumstance, standing alone, might lead one to conclude that the appropriate remedy\u2014and, for\n\nthat matter, the only one the States would have standing to seek\u2014is notice, albeit overdue.\n\n20\n\fBut this ignores the nature of the States injuries. While the initial harm was caused by a\nlack of notice, the States\u2019 informational harm includes at least some of the serious downstream\nharms the States assert. Thus, those downstream injuries must be considered in the redressability\nanalysis.\n\nThe remedy the States seek is to set aside the Government\u2019s allegedly unlawful RIFs\u2014a\nremedy which, in effect, would require the reinstatement of the terminated employees. (See ECF\nNo. 1 | 242-43.) The Government appears to agree. (See, e.g., ECF No. 20 at 14 (\u201c[T]he States\u2019\nasserted injuries could only be conceivably redressed by their reinstatement.\u201d (emphasis in\noriginal).) So, too, does the Court. After all, the States\u2019 injuries are the result of the increasing\npressure on States\u2019 rapid-response, unemployment, and other public programs. Were the\nterminated employees to be reinstated, that pressure would abate. That is enough for redressability.\n\nB. Jurisdiction\n\n1. Final Agency Action\n\nThe Court begins by clarifying the conduct at issue in this case, at least for purposes of the\npending TRO request. The States challenge two distinct federal actions: first, the OPM directives\nthat allegedly directed other federal agencies to dismiss probationary employees en masse; and\nsecond, the actual, agency-level dismissals of those employees without notice. (ECF No. 4-1 at\n24-25.) But the nub of this lawsuit is the lack of notice the States received with respect to the RIF\nprovisions. (See, e.g., ECF No. 19 at 3 (\u201cThe strain on Plaintiffs\u2019 rapid response systems is directly\ntraceable to Defendants\u2019 unlawful RIFs, conducted without the required advanced notice.\u201d)). And\nthe agency actions that are most proximate to that harm are the dismissals without notice, not the\nOPM directives, for one simple reason: under the RIF regulations, notice must come from the\n\ndismissing agencies, not from OPM, except as it concerns OPM\u2019s dismissals of its own\n\n21\n\femployees. See 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.803(b). For that reason, this Memorandum focuses on the\nunnoticed dismissals, though the Court makes no final determination at present as to which actions\nare appropriately reviewed in this litigation.\n\n\u201cJudicial review under the [Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d)] is limited to review of\n\u2018final agency action.\u201d\u201d NAACP v. Bureau of the Census, 945 F.3d 183, 189 (4th Cir. 2019)\n(quoting 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 704). But, as explained below, the unnoticed dismissals fall squarely within\nthat category. Accordingly, the APA poses no jurisdictional obstacle to this Court\u2019s review of the\nStates\u2019 claims.\u2019\n\nTo start, \u201cagency action\u201d is a capacious term, \u201ccover[ing] comprehensively every manner\nin which an agency may exercise its power.\u201d Whitman v. Am. Trucking Ass\u2019ns, 531 US. 457,478\n(2001) (citation omitted). And while the Government refers to the acts at issue as \u201calleged final\nagency actions,\u201d (ECF No. 20 at 14, 23), it does not otherwise dispute that the dismissals are\n\u201cagency actions\u201d within the meaning of the APA\u2019s review provision. Nor could it. See, e.g.,\nBurdue v. FAA, 774 F.3d 1076, 1080 (6th Cir. 2014) (\u201c[An agency employee\u2019s] termination is. . .\nagency action for purposes of the [APA].\u201d).\n\nAs for \u201cfinality,\u201d an action is \u201cfinal\u201d whenever two conditions are satisfied: (1) the action\nis the \u201cconsummation of the agency\u2019s decisionmaking process,\u201d and (2) the action is one \u201cby which\nrights or obligations have been determined or from which legal consequences will flow.\u201d NAACP,\n945 F.3d at 189 (ultimately quoting Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 177-78 (1997)). The firings\n\nwithout notice undeniably meet this standard, as any agency\u2019s decision to dismiss an employee\n\n* Notably, the requirement of \u201cfinal agency action\u201d applies only to the States\u2019s two APA claims, not their ultra vires\nclaim. This is because the right of action for an u/tra vires claim flows from the federal courts\u2019 equity jurisdiction,\nnot from the APA. See, e.g., PFLAG, Inc. v. Trump, Civ. No. BAH-25-337, 2025 WL 685124, at *9 & n.26 (D. Md.\nMar. 4, 2025) (citing Trudeau v. FTC, 456 F.3d 178, 187 (D.C. Cir. 2006)). That said, for purposes of the pending\nTRO request, the Court addresses the merits only of the States\u2019 APA claims, not their more unusual w/tra vires claim,\ndespite jurisdiction to consider each. See infra Section IILA.\n\n22\n\feffects self-evident legal consequences for both parties and plainly marks the end of the agency\u2019s\ndecisionmaking with respect to the employee involved. See, e.g., Burdue, 774 F.3d at 1080; cf\nAm. Fed\u2019n of Gov't Emps., AFL-CIO v. OPM, Civ. No. WHA-25-1780, 2025 WL 660053, at *5\n(N.D. Cal. Feb. 28, 2025) (\u201cOPM\u2019s direction to the other agencies [to dismiss probationary\nemployees] constituted a final agency action for the purposes of the APA.\u201d).\n\nThe Court therefore has jurisdiction to review each of the States\u2019 claims, at least insofar as\nthey concern dismissals without notice.\n\n2. Claim Channeling\n\nThe Government argues that the Court has no jurisdiction to hear the States\u2019 claims because\nof an alternative administrative review structure set up by Congress.\n\nIn Thunder Basin Coal Co. v. Reich, 510 U.S. 200 (1994), the Supreme Court articulated\na two-step analytical framework to assess whether Congress impliedly divested the district courts\nof jurisdiction to hear challenges to an agency action.\n\nFirst, a reviewing court asks whether some statute, either explicitly or implicitly, channels\ncertain claims about agency action away from the courts and into an administrative agency. See\nAxon Enter., Inc. v. FTC, 598 U.S. 175, 185 (2023); Bennett v. SEC, 844 F.3d 174, 181 (4th Cir.\n2016). This inquiry \u201cinvolves examining the statute\u2019s text, structure, and purpose.\u201d Bennett, 844\nF.3d at 181 (citing Elgin v. Dep\u2019t of Treasury, 567 U.S. 1, 10 (2012)).\n\nSecond, if the reviewing court determines that a statute does channel certain claims away\nfrom the courts, it then considers whether the specific claims at issue fall within that category. See\nAxon, 598 U.S. at 185-86; see also id. at 186 (\u201cThe ultimate question is how best to understand\nwhat Congress has done\u2014whether the statutory review scheme, though exclusive where it applies,\n\nreaches the claim in question.\u201d). In essence, the court\u2019s task is \u201cto decide if a claim is \u2018of the type\u2019\n\n23\n\fCongress thought belonged within a statutory scheme.\u201d J/d. at 188-89 (quoting Thunder Basin,\n510 U.S. at 212). Only in \u201climited circumstances\u201d is a claim not \u201cof th[at] type,\u201d Arch Coal, Inc.\nv. Acosta, 888 F.3d 493, 500 (D.C. Cir. 2018), given that procedures \u201cdesigned to permit agency\nexpertise to be brought to bear on particular problems\u201d ought ordinarily to be understood as\nexclusive. See Free Enter. Fund yv. Pub. Co. Acct. Oversight Bd., 561 U.S. 477, 489 (2010)\n(quoting Whitney Nat\u2019l Bank v. Bank of New Orleans & Trust Co., 379 U.S. 411, 420 (1965)).\n\nTo assess whether such \u201climited circumstances\u201d are present in an individual case, courts\napply the three so-called Thunder Basin factors: (1) whether precluding district court jurisdiction\nwould \u201cforeclose all meaningful judicial review\u201d of the claims, (2) whether the claims are \u201cwholly\ncollateral to [the] statute\u2019s review provisions,\u201d and (3) whether the claims are \u201coutside the agency\u2019s\nexpertise.\u201d Axon, 598 U.S. at 186 (alteration in original) (quoting Thunder Basin, 510 U.S. at 212\u2014\n13). \u201cWhen the answer to all three questions is yes, \u2018[the court] presume[s] that Congress does\nnot intend to limit jurisdiction,\u2019\u201d id. (quoting Free Enter. Fund, 561 U.S. at 489), though a claim\nmay be judicially reviewable even if the factors \u201cpoint in different directions,\u201d id.\n\nAs both the States and the Government observe, Congress has provided for the exclusive\nadministrative review of most employment claims brought by federal employees, thus satisfying\nthe first step of the two-step framework. Two statutory review schemes are relevant here. The\nfirst is set out in the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (\u201cFSMLRS\u201d), itself set\nout in Title VII of the Civil Service Reform Act (\u201cCSRA\u201d), Pub. L. No. 95-454, \u00a7 701, 92 Stat.\n1111, 1191-216 (1978) (codified at 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7101-35). As the District of D.C. recently\nexplained in a similar context, the FSMLRS\n\ngoverns labor relations between the executive branch and its employees. It \u201cgrants\n\nfederal employees the right to organize and bargain collectively, and it requires that\n\nunions and federal agencies negotiate in good faith over certain matters.\u201d Am.\nFed'nof Gov't Emps., AFL-CIO v. Trump, 929 F.3d 748, 752 (D.C. Cir. 2019). The\n\n24\n\f[FSMLRS] further \u201cestablishes a scheme of administrative and judicial\nreview.\u201d Jd. Under that scheme, the Federal Labor Relations Authority (\u201cFLRA\u201d),\na three-member agency charged with adjudicating federal labor disputes, reviews\nmatters including \u201cnegotiability\u201d and \u201cunfair labor practice\u201d disputes. See 5 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 7105(a). When reviewing unfair labor practice complaints, \u201cthe FLRA resolves\nwhether an agency must bargain over a subject, violated the duty to bargain in good\nfaith, or otherwise failed to comply with the Statute.\u201d Trump, 929 F.3d at 752\n(citing 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7105(a)(2)(G), 7116(a), 7118).\n\nDirect review of the FLRA\u2019s decisions is available in the courts of appeals. 5\nU.S.C. \u00a7 7123(a). The D.C. Circuit has repeatedly held that this scheme \u201cprovides\nthe exclusive procedures by which federal employees and their bargaining\nrepresentatives may assert federal labor-management relations claims.\u201d Trump,\n929 F.3d at 755 (quoting AFGE v. Sec\u2019y of the Air Force, 716 F.3d 633, 636 (D.C.\nCir. 2013)).\n\nNat'l Treasury Emps. Union vy. Trump, Civ. No. CRC-25-420, 2025 WL 561080, at *4 (D.D.C.\nFeb. 20, 2025).\n\nThe second statutory review scheme is set out elsewhere in the CSRA, which separately\n\u201cestablished a comprehensive system for reviewing personnel action taken against federal\nemployees.\u201d See Elgin, 567 U.S. at 5 (citation omitted). Under those provisions,\n\n[iJf an agency takes a final adverse action against an employee\u2014removal,\n\nsuspension for more than [fourteen] days, reduction in grade or pay, or furlough for\n\n[thirty] days or less, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7512\u2014the employee may appeal to the Merit\n\nSystems Protection Board (\u201cMSPB\u201d). 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513(d). The MSPB may order\n\nrelief to prevailing employees, including reinstatement, backpay, and attorney's\n\nfees. Id. \u00a7\u00a7 1204(a)(2), 7701(g). Probationary employees, however, generally do\n\nnot enjoy a right to appeal to the MSPB. Jd. \u00a7 7511(a)(1). Employees may appeal\n\nfinal MSPB decisions to the Federal Circuit, which has \u201cexclusive jurisdiction\u201d\n\nover such appeals. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(9). This statutory review scheme, too, is\n\n\u201cexclusive, even for employees who bring constitutional challenges to federal\n\nstatutes.\u201d Elgin, 567 U.S. at 13.\n\nNat\u2019l Treasury Emps. Union, 2025 WL 561080, at *5.\nNotwithstanding the existence of two exclusive statutory review schemes, the Court\n\nconcludes that, under the three 7hunder Basin factors, those schemes do not foreclose district-\n\ncourt jurisdiction over the States\u2019 claims in this case.\n\n25\n\fOn the first factor, foreclosure of meaningful judicial review, it is clear the States\nprevail. The Government argues that \u201cany affected party\u201d may challenge the RIF dismissals\n\u201cwithin the administrative scheme\u201d Congress has provided. (ECF No. 20 at 19.) But that\nargument is defeated by the plain text of the statutory scheme the Government cites, which\nforecloses any possibility of the States bringing their claims before an administrative agency. In\nrelevant part, the FLRA has the authority to \u201cconduct hearings and resolve complaints of unfair\nlabor practices,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7105(a)(2)(G), charges of which may be brought \u201cby any person,\u201d id.\n\u00a7 7118(a)(1); see also id. \u00a7 7121(g)(3)-(4) (referring to the ability of \u201ca person\u201d to appeal to the\nMSPB, among other remedies). Yet the labor-management relations chapter of the CSRA defines\na \u201cperson\u201d as \u201can individual, labor organization, or agency\u2019\u2014not a State. 5 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 7103(a)(1). Similarly, the MSPB may hear appeals from \u201c[a]n employee, or applicant for\nemployment,\u201d id. \u00a7 7701; see also id. \u00a7 7513(d) (permitting appeals by \u201cemployee[s]\u201d)}\u2014again,\ncategories that could not plausibly include States. Cf id. \u00a7 7103(a)(2) (defining \u201cemployee,\u201d for\npurposes of the labor-management chapter, as either an individual \u201cemployed in an agency\u201d or an\nindividual whose employment \u201chas ceased because of any unfair labor practice,\u201d as described\nelsewhere in the statute).\n\nBeyond being unable to seek review by any agencies, the States are also foreclosed from\nseeking judicial review of agency decisions. While the Government is correct that the Federal\nCircuit has exclusive jurisdiction over challenges to the final decisions of the MSPB, (see ECF\nNo. 20 at 19 (citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(9))), the MSPB\u2019s own statute shows that judicial review\nis available only for \u201cemployee[s] or applicant(s] for employment affected or aggrieved\u201d by the\n\nMSPB\u2019s decisions, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(a)(1) (emphasis added). Likewise, although the Courts of\n\n26\n\fAppeals have exclusive jurisdiction over review of most final orders of the FLRA, such review is,\nagain, available only for \u201c[a]ny person aggrieved\u201d by such orders. Jd. \u00a7 7123(a).\n\nIn short, the Government supplies no authority for the proposition that a State would be\nable to seek review in any relevant setting\u2014and, indeed, conceded during the TRO hearing that\nnone could.> This shortcoming alone is arguably fatal to the Government\u2019s position, given that\n\u201cmeaningful judicial review is the most important factor in the Thunder Basin analysis.\u201d Bennett,\n844 F.3d at 183 n.7 (collecting cases). If the Government were correct, then Congress would have\ncreated a statutory entitlement for States to be provided notice under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d)(3)(A)(i),\nbut provided no judicial review to vindicate that entitlement, a conclusion contrary to the \u201cstrong\npresumption that Congress intends judicial review of administrative action.\u201d Bowen v. Mich. Acad.\nof Fam. Physicians, 476 U.S. 667, 670 (1986).\n\nThe second factor, claims\u2019 collaterality to the statutory review provisions, likewise favors\nthe States. For its part, the Government argues the States seek to \u201cinterject themselves into the\nemployment relationship between the United States and government workers.\u201d (ECF No. 20 at\n3.) But that ignores that the States have suffered unique harms, peculiar to their status as states,\nirrespective of those harms\u2019 connection with the agency-employee relationship. See 5 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 3502(d); 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.803; see also supra Sections I.A, .C. For that reason, the Government\u2019s\n\nreference to parallel proceedings before the MSPB and Office of Special Counsel (\u201cOSC\u201d), (see\n\n\u00b0 Likewise, the Government supplies no authority for the related (but equally dubious) proposition that the CSRA\nwholly divests the district courts of jurisdiction to offer reinstatement as a remedy, (see, e.g., ECF No. 20 at 14), rather\nthan the more limited view that the CSRA divests the courts of jurisdiction to offer that remedy to specific parties. This\nlatter view is the better interpretation of the CSRA\u2019s preclusive scope. See, e.g., Elgin, 567 U.S. at 13 (explaining that\nthe CSRA\u2019s review is exclusive as it concerns federal employees, without any indication that it is exclusive as to\nreinstatement); (see also ECF No. 20 at 14 n.6 (conceding that the district courts do have jurisdiction over Title VII\nclaims, which may lead to reinstatement)). Perhaps that is why, when making hay of the fact that two other courts\nrecognized a lack of jurisdiction to entertain certain claims for reinstatement, (see ECF No. 20 at 3 (first citing Nat'l\nTreasury Emps. Union, 2025 WL 561080; and then citing Am. Fed\u2019n of Gov't Emps., 2025 WL 660053)), the\nGovernment completely elides the fact that those claims were brought by fundamentally different parties\u2014namely,\nemployees and their unions.\n\n27\n\fECF No. 20 at 10), is unavailing. As the Supreme Court has explained, \u201cdecid[ing] when a\nparticular claim is \u2018of the type\u2019 to fall outside a statutory review scheme . . . requires considering\nthe nature of the claim, not the status (pending or not) of an agency proceeding.\u201d Axon, 598 U.S.\nat 194 (emphasis added) (quoting Thunder Basin, 510 U.S. at 212). Indeed, Thunder Basin\n\u201ccontemplates . . . that even when a proceeding is pending, an occasional claim may get immediate\nreview\u2014in part because it involves something discrete.\u201d Jd. What\u2019s more, Axon permitted\njudicial review of claims directed at ongoing proceedings involving the very parties seeking\njudicial review, see id. at 193-94\u2014in other words, claims much closer (and therefore less\ncollateral) to an administrative proceeding than are the States\u2019 claims in this case, particularly\ngiven that the States have no administrative remedy available to them.\n\nThe third and final factor, the agencies\u2019 expertise, is a closer call, but likely also breaks for\nthe States. Again, there is no mechanism for the States to obtain administrative review before the\nMSPB, the FLRA, or the OSC. There is thus little reason to think those agencies hold special\nexpertise over the States\u2019 claims. On the contrary, the States\u2019 claims \u201craise \u2018standard questions of\nadministrative\u2019 ... law, detached from \u2018considerations of agency policy.\u2019\u201d Axon, 598 at 194\n(quoting Free Enter. Fund, 561 U.S. at 491). And while the MSPB, FLRA, and OSC \u201cknow]] a\ngood deal about\u201d unlawful dismissal of federal employees, they know \u201cnothing special about\u201d the\ncentral problem the States have asserted: a failure to provide proper notice under the RIF\nstatute. Cf id. And as the Court has by now made clear, that the States\u2019 problem connects with\nunlawful dismissals hardly means those dismissals are the subject of this suit.\n\nThe Government argues, unpersuasively, that the fact someone can seek review of similar\nclaims is enough to disclaim jurisdiction over the States\u2019 action. (See ECF No. 20 at 21 (\u201c[T]he\n\nCSRA and FSL-MRS schemes provide for meaningful judicial review over the very claims\n\n28\n\fasserted by the States, even if the States themselves are not the proper parties to assert them.\u201d).)\nThere are multiple problems with this theory. First, as explained above, while certain facts are\ncommon to the States\u2019 action and any administrative actions that might be brought by terminated\nemployees, the States\u2019 interests remain substantially different from the employees\u2019, as evinced by\nthe presence of harms that only states gua states can experience. Second, it is hard to swallow that\nthe States, to redress their harms, must simply hope and wait for scores of terminated federal\nemployees to pursue administrative relief. For one, the States are suffering precisely the sort of\n\u201chere-and-now injury\u201d that favors prompt judicial review. See Axon, 598 U.S. at 191 (quoting\nSeila Law LLC v. CFPB, 591 U.S. 197, 212 (2020)). For another, it is highly doubtful that solo\nemployees or their unions would or could adequately represent the States\u2019 peculiar interests in an\nadministrative setting. For the States\u2019 harms to be fully redressed in that manner, it would seem\nto require every employee who was dismissed without notice to pursue (and win) administrative\nrelief, either individually or collectively, such that the pressure on state unemployment programs\nwould eventually, and in piecemeal fashion, be alleviated. The Court is not prepared to accept that\ntheory as reality.\n\nIn sum, the CSRA does not preclude this Court\u2019s jurisdiction over the States\u2019 claims. Time\nand again, the courts have been firm: \u201cCongress rarely allows claims about agency action to escape\neffective judicial review.\u201d Axon, 598 U.S. at 186 (citing Bowen, 476 U.S. at 670); accord Abbott\nLab\u2019ys v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 140 (1967) (collecting cases, and observing that \u201cjudicial review\nof a final agency action . . . will not be cut off unless there is persuasive reason to believe that such\nwas the purpose of Congress\u201d); see also 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702 (\u201cA person suffering legal wrong because\nof agency action... is entitled to judicial review thereof.\u201d). Here, remarkably, the Government\n\nargues that not only is there no judicial review for the States, there is no review of any kind. That\n\n29\n\fis a startling state of affairs indeed\u2014and one that basic principles of administrative law require\nthis Court to reject.\nV. TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER\n\nHaving determined that the Court has jurisdiction to hear this case, the Court turns to the\nfactors necessary for issuance of a TRO.\n\n\u201cThe standard for a temporary restraining order is the same as a preliminary injunction.\u201d\nMaages Auditorium v. Prince George\u2019s County, 4 F. Supp. 3d 752, 760 n.1 (D. Md. 2014), aff'd,\n681 F. App\u2019x 256 (4th Cir. 2017). The party seeking a temporary restraining order \u201cmust establish\nthat he is likely to succeed on the merits, that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence\nof preliminary relief, that the balance of equities tips in his favor, and that an injunction is in the\npublic interest.\u201d Winter v. Nat. Res. Def: Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008). Although Plaintiffs\n\u201cneed not establish a \u2018certainty of success,\u201d\u201d they must \u201cmake a clear showing that [they are] likely\nto succeed at trial.\u201d Di Biase v. SPX Corp., 872 F.3d 224, 230 (4th Cir. 2017) (quoting Pashby v.\nDelia, 709 F.3d 307, 321 (4th Cir. 2013)). A TRO is \u201can extraordinary remedy that may only be\nawarded upon a clear showing that the plaintiff is entitled to such relief.\u201d Winter, 555 U.S. at 22.\n\nThe Court concludes that the States have established all four factors, and that a TRO is\nwarranted.\n\nA. Likelihood of Success on the Merits\n\nThe States are very likely to succeed on the merits of (at least) their APA contrary-to-law\nclaim. Under the APA, a court shall \u201chold unlawful and set aside agency action... foundtobe...\narbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d 5 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 706(2)(A). For purposes of a contrary-to-law claim, the legal standards against which the federal\n\ngovernment\u2019s conduct is assessed are supplied not by the APA itself, but by a separate statute\u2014in\n\n30\n\fthis case, the RIF statute, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502. The Court concludes that the States are highly likely\nto show that they are within the zone of interests of the RIF statute, that the Government conducted\nRIFs, and that, when doing so, it wholly failed to comply with the statutory and regulatory demand\nthat notice be provided to the States.\n\n1. Zone of Interests\n\nIn general, statutory protections \u201cextend[] only to plaintiffs whose interests \u2018fall within the\nzone of interests protected by the law invoked,\u2019\u201d whether or not a statute is invoked under the\nAPA. Lexmark Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, 129 (2014) (quoting\nAllen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 751 (1984)). Nevertheless, \u201cin the APA context, that . . . test is not\n\u2018especially demanding.\u2019\u201d Jd. at 130 (quoting Match-E\u2014Be\u2014Nash\u2014She\u2014Wish Band of Pottawatomi\nIndians v. Patchak, 567 U.S. 209, 225 (2012)). All it requires is that a plaintiff's interest be\n\u201carguably within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated\u201d by the underlying\nstatute. Match-E\u2014Be\u2014Nash\u2014-She\u2014Wish Band, 567 U.S. at 224 (emphasis added) (quoting Ass \u2019n of\nData Processing Serv. Orgs., Inc. v. Camp, 357 U.S. 150, 153 (1970)). Indeed, \u201c[t]he test\nforecloses suit only when a plaintiffs \u2018interests are so marginally related to or inconsistent with\nthe purposes implicit in the statute that it cannot reasonably be assumed that Congress intended to\npermit the suit.\u2019\u201d Jd. at 225 (quoting Clarke v. Sec. Indus. Ass\u2019n, 497 U.S. 388, 399 (1987)).\n\nFar beyond merely coming within the legal \u201czone of interests,\u201d the States\u2019 interests in this\ncase strike at the very heart of the RIF provisions.\n\nFor one, the statute expressly identifies States and the notice they are due. See 5 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 3502(d)(3)(A)(i) (\u201cNotice .. . shall be given to .. . the State or entity designated by the State to\ncarry out rapid response activities under... the [Workplace Innovation and Opportunity Act\n\n(\u201cWIOA\u201d)].\u201d); see also 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.803(b) (similar). It also describes precisely what must be\n\n31\n\fshared with the States. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d)(3)(B) (requiring notice of \u201cthe number of\nemployees to be separated from service\u201d due to a RIF, \u201cbroken down by geographic area or on\nsuch other basis as may be required by\u201d other regulations; \u201cwhen those separations will occur\u201d;\nand \u201cany other matter which might facilitate the delivery of rapid response assistance or other\nservices under ... the [WIOA]\u201d); see also 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.803(c) (similar). Based on the text of\nthe statute alone, Congress clearly envisioned for the States an important role in the RIF process.\n\nBeyond occupying a place of prominence in the RIF statutory text, the States also hold\nlegal duties under the WIOA and its implementing regulations to offer rapid-response services to\nalleviate the societal stresses brought on by sudden mass unemployment. As the Court has\ndiscussed above, see supra Section I.A, the States are required by federal law to respond to assist\nworkers in finding new employment. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 682.200. The States have their own binding\nrequirements regarding rapid-response activities. See, e.g., Md. Code Ann., Lab. & Empl. \u00a7\u00a7 11\u2014\n303 to -04. And the States provide unemployment and similar benefits to their own citizens. See\ngenerally, e.g., Md. Code Ann., Lab. & Empl. \u00a7\u00a7 8-101 to \u20141608; N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 43:21-1 to \u2014\n71.\n\nAll of this underscores the general proposition that the States have important\u2014indeed,\nmandatory\u2014uses for RIF notice from the Government, and therefore strong interests in such notice\nbeing provided on time and in full. It would defy common sense to say these are not among those\ninterests \u201carguably\u201d protected by the RIF provisions. See Match-E\u2014Be\u2014Nash\u2014She\u2014Wish Band,\n567 U.S. at 224.\n\n2. The Agencies Conducted RIFs\n\nHaving determined that the States may bring this action under the APA, the Court turns to\n\nthe substantive core of this case\u2014whether the States are likely to succeed in showing that the\n\n32\n\fGovernment\u2019s mass terminations, without providing notice to the States, were unlawful. The\nGovernment makes essentially two arguments in support of its contention that it has not acted\ncontrary to law. (See ECF No. 20 at 23-25.) First, it argues that it had the discretion to terminate\nthe probationary employees in the manner that it did. (See id. at 23 (\u201cThe States fundamentally\nmisunderstand Defendants\u2019 discretion to terminate probationers.\u201d).) Second, it argues that it did\nnot conduct a RIF. (See id. at 24-25 (\u201c[T]he States ignore fundamental differences between a RIF\nand the termination of a probationer. The actions they challenge here are the latter, not the\nformer.\u201d).) These arguments are unavailing.\n\nAgencies are, of course, permitted to terminate probationary employees. That is not what\nthis case is about. Indeed, agencies are directed to \u201cutilize the probationary period as fully as\npossible to determine the fitness of the employee and shall terminate his or her services during this\nperiod if the employee fails to demonstrate fully his or her qualifications for continued\nemployment.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.803(a). However, agencies are permitted to terminate probationary\nemployees under only three circumstances: (1) due to conditions arising prior to their employment,\n5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.805; (2) due to unsatisfactory performance or conduct, 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.804(a); and\n(3) pursuant to a RIF. Neither the Court nor the parties has identified any other permissible reason\nto terminate a probationary employee. Indeed, the Government was invited at the TRO hearing to\nidentify any other permissible ways to terminate probationary employees, and it could not do so.\n\nHere, the terminated probationary employees were plainly not terminated for cause. The\nsheer number of employees that were terminated in a matter of days belies any argument that these\n\nterminations were due to the employees\u2019 individual unsatisfactory performance or conduct. As\n\n33\n\fPlaintiffs allege, the Government has terminated at least 24,000 probationary employees.\u00ae\u00b0 (ECF\nNo. | \u00a7 139 (\u201cDefendants have not published official counts and locations of the employees they\nhave terminated, but based on publicly reported numbers and firsthand accounts from affected\nemployees, it appears that Defendants have terminated at least 24,000 probationary employees as\nof the date of this Complaint.\u201d).) It is simply not conceivable that the Government could have\nconducted individualized assessments of the relevant employees in the relevant timeframe. (See,\ne.g., ECF No. 4-37 \u00a7 14 (\u201cPractically speaking, it would take weeks or months to evaluate the job\nperformance of 6,700 probationary employees.\u201d).)\n\nThe States also provided affidavits from individuals who worked at certain Defendant\nAgencies, reflecting that the termination decisions were not based upon individualized assessments\nof the relevant employees. (ECF No. 4-36 \u00a7\u00a7 4, 19 (former \u201cDeputy Director for Operations in the\nCenter for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight (CCIIO) within the Centers for\nMedicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)\u201d explaining that \u201c[t]he mass terminations of probationary\nemployees at CCIIO were not based on any individualized assessment of the probationary\nemployees. The CMS [chief human resources officer] did not review the positions for suitability,\nnever read a single person\u2019s resume, never spoke with any of the terminated probationary\nemployees, and had no personal knowledge of their individual performance.\u201d), ECF No. 4-37 \u00a7 14\n(former \u201cHuman Capital Officer for the Internal Revenue Service (\u2018IRS\u2019)\u201d explaining that\n\u201cTreasury did not review or consider the actual job performance or conduct of any IRS\nprobationary employee when issuing the termination notices. I know this because this fact was\n\ndiscussed openly in meetings.\u201d).)\n\n\u00ae At the TRO hearing, the Government was unable to supply the Court with the number of probationary employees\nwho, to date, have been terminated from the relevant agencies. The Government likewise provided the Court with no\nevidence to suggest that the States\u2019 estimate was inaccurate.\n\n34\n\fThe Government offers no contrary evidence, yet it insists that these were for-cause\nterminations and that the notices provided to individual employees were not defective because \u201c[a]\nstatement that a probationer has been terminated because of his or her performance during the\nprobationary period is sufficient.\u201d (ECF No. 20 at 24.)\n\nThe Court does not render any conclusions regarding what precise language a termination\nfor cause must contain; however, the law is clear that when dismissing an employee due to\nunsatisfactory performance, \u201c[t]he employer . . . must honestly be dissatisfied with the\nprobationer\u2019s conduct or performance after giving him a fair trial on the job.\u201d McGuffin v. Soc.\nSec. Admin., 942 F.3d 1099, 1102 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (emphasis added) (citation and internal\nquotation marks omitted). The affidavits filed by terminated probationary employees reflect that\nthey received boilerplate termination notices explaining that their performance was inadequate,\nbut that they had all received either formal or informal positive feedback from their supervisors.\n(E.g., ECF No. 33-1 (affidavit and termination letter from former U.S. Department of\nTransportation probationary employee); ECF No. 33-2 (affidavit and termination letter from\nformer U.S. Department of Health and Human Services probationary employee); ECF No. 33-5\n(affidavit and termination letter from former U.S. Department of the Interior probationary\nemployee); ECF No. 33-10 (affidavit and termination letter from former Internal Revenue Service\u2019\nprobationary employee); ECF No. 33-11 (affidavit and termination letter from former Federal\nEmergency Management Agency\u00ae probationary employee); ECF No. 33-14 (affidavit and\n\ntermination letter from former Consumer Financial Protection Bureau probationary employee),\n\nECF No. 33-15 (affidavit and termination letter from former National Oceanic and Atmospheric\n\n7 Although the IRS is not named as a Defendant, it sits within the Department of the Treasury, which is named.\n\n8 Although the Federal Emergency Management Agency is not named as a Defendant, it sits within the Department\nof Homeland Security, which is named.\n\n35\n\fAdministration probationary\u2019 employee); ECF No. 33-16 (affidavit and termination letter from\nformer U.S. Department of Agriculture probationary employee); ECF No. 33-17 (affidavit and\ntermination letter from former Environmental Protection Agency probationary employee); ECF\nNo. 33-18 (affidavit and termination letter from former Small Business Administration\nprobationary employee); ECF No. 33-19 (affidavit and termination letter from former U.S.\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs probationary employee).)\n\nFurther underscoring the Court\u2019s conclusion that these terminations were not based upon\nqualifications or performance is that many notices to employees did not even cursorily identify\nany issues with the individual\u2019s performance, but rather explained that their terminations were in\nthe public interest or due to the priorities of the current administration, or else provided no reason\nat all. (E.g., ECF No. 33-3 at 7 (U.S. Agency for International Development termination letter\nindicating that \u201cI am terminating you on the basis that it is in the best interest of the U.S.\nGovernment\u201d); ECF No. 33-4 at 7 (U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development\ntermination letter indicating that \u201cthis notice is to notify you of the decision to terminate your\nemployment . . . in order to promote the efficiency of the federal service in accordance with the\npriorities of the Administration\u201d); ECF No. 33-6 at 7 (U.S. Department of Labor termination letter\nindicating that \u201c[t]he Agency finds your further employment would not be in the public interest\u2019);\nECF No. 33-7 at 8 (General Services Administration termination letter indicating \u201cI do not\nconsider it in the best interest of the government to retain you in the Federal service and have\ndecided to terminate your appointment during your probationary period.\u201d); ECF No. 33-8 at 7\n(U.S. Department of Education termination letter indicating that \u201cI regrettably inform you that I\n\nam removing you from your position of [redacted] with the agency and the federal civil service\n\n* Although the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is not named as a Defendant, it sits within the U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce, which is named.\n\n36\n\feffective today, February 12, 2025.\u201d); ECF No. 33-9 at 7 (U.S. Department of the Treasury\ntermination letter stating that \u201c[b]ased on [OPM] guidance and in light of current mission needs,\nthe Agency finds that your continued employment at the Agency is not in the public interest\u201d);\nECF No. 33-12 at 7 (U.S. Department of Energy termination letter stating \u201c[p]er OPM instructions,\nDOE finds that your further employment would not be in the public interest\u201d); ECF No. 33-13 at\n8 (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation termination letter stating that \u201cthe FDIC finds that you\nhave not demonstrated that your further employment at the FDIC would be in the public interest\u2019\u2019).)\n\nIn short, the record reflects that these probationary employees were not terminated for\ncause. Cf Roe v. Dep't of Defense, 947 F.3d 207, 222 (4th Cir. 2020) (holding that the Air Force\ndid not perform \u201cindividualized determination[s]\u201d when the \u201cthe Air Force discharge memoranda\ncontain identical language briefly stating that each servicemember\u2019s HIV-positive status \u2018renders\n\n309\n\nhim ineligible for deployment\u2019\u201d). The Government\u2019s contention to the contrary borders on the\nfrivolous. Moreover, to the extent that the Government counsel tries to justify these terminations\nas for cause after the fact, such an attempt must fail, as \u201cthe post hoc rationalizations of the agency\nor the parties to this litigation cannot serve as a sufficient predicate for agency action.\u201d Am. Textile\nMfrs. Inst., Inc. v. Donovan, 452 U.S. 490, 539 (1981). And, as the Government conceded at the\nhearing, probationary employees may only be terminated for cause (either due to qualifications\nand performance, or for issues arising prior to employment) or through a RIF.\n\nThe actions of the Government reflect that these terminations were RIFs. The relevant\nregulations provide that \u201c[e]ach agency shall follow this part when it releases a competing\nemployee from his or her competitive level by . . . separation . . . , when the release is required\n\nbecause of lack of work; shortage of funds; insufficient personnel ceiling; reorganization; the\n\nexercise of reemployment rights or restoration rights; or reclassification of an employee\u2019s position\n\n37\n\f[due] to erosion of duties when such action will take effect after an agency has formally announced\na reduction in force in the employee\u2019s competitive area and when the reduction in force will take\neffect within 180 days.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.201(a)(2); see also U.S. Off. of Pers. Mgmt., Workforce\nReshaping Operations Handbook, 25-26 (2017) (explaining that \u201c[a] personnel action must be\neffected under RIF procedures when both the action to be taken and the reason for the action are\ncovered by the RIF regulations\u201d; including, under \u201cactions to be taken,\u201d an employee\u2019s separation;\nand including, under \u201creason for the action,\u201d a \u201clack of work,\u201d \u201cshortage of funds,\u201d \u201cinsufficient\npersonnel ceiling,\u201d and/or \u201creorganization\u201d). The wholesale dismissal of employees due to their\nstatus as probationary employees appears to be some form of reorganization, even if the\nGovernment does not refer to it as such.\n\nThat these terminations were RIFs is evident from the sheer number of employees fired in\nsuch a short timespan. Further, the Secretary of Labor for the Maryland Department of Labor\nreported that, in response to queries from her office, federal agencies have reported, as reasons for\nthe terminations, a \u201cpermanent lack of work due to a change in Presidential administration,\u201d and\nhave also noted that the employees were \u201claid off due to a reduction in force.\u201d (ECF No. 4-5\n{| 61-62.) On this point, the Court again observes that several employee termination notices\nevince that the terminations were plainly not due to any individual employee\u2019s performance, but\nrather reflected a reorganization within the relevant federal agencies. For instance, a termination\nletter issued by the Department of the Treasury states the following: \u201cIn its January 20, 2025,\nmemorandum entitled Guidance on Probationary Periods, Administrative Leave and Details,\nOPM advised that \u2018[p]robationary periods are an essential tool for agencies to assess employee\nperformance and manage staffing levels.\u2019 Based on that guidance and in light of current mission\n\nneeds, the Agency finds that your continued employment at the Agency is not in the public\n\n38\n\finterest.\u201d (ECF No. 33-9 at 7 (alterations in original).) On top of that, the terminations came on\nthe heels of an Executive Order directing agency heads to conduct RIFs.\n\nThe States have not carried their burden, however, of showing a likelihood of success on\nthe merits with respect to three Defendant Agencies\u2014the Department of Defense (\u201cDefense\u201d), the\nNational Archives and Records Administration (\u201cArchives\u201d), and OPM. With respect to these\nthree named agencies only, the States have not provided any affidavits from, for example, former\nemployees attesting to their terminations, or to the presence of widespread terminations of\nprobationary employees. (See generally ECF No. 33 (affidavits attesting to terminations at all\nDefendant Agencies except for Defense, Archives, and OPM).) While the Court does not rely\nsolely on these affidavits and termination letters in reaching its above conclusion, those records\nprovide an important link between the individual Defendant Agencies and the broader allegations\nabout the number of employees terminated and the general statements, discussed above, that these\nactions constituted RIFs. So, although it is a close call, at this early stage, and given that a TRO\nis \u201can extraordinary remedy that may only be awarded upon a clear showing that the plaintiff is\nentitled to such relief,\u201d Winter, 555 U.S. at 22 (citation omitted), there is insufficient basis in the\nrecord for the Court to conclude that RIFs likely occurred at these three agencies. This conclusion\nis without prejudice to the presentation of additional evidence with respect to these three agencies.\n\n3. The Agencies\u2019 Actions Were Contrary to Statutory RIF Requirements\n\nThus, the Court turns to whether the Government followed requisite RIF procedures. If\nemployees are terminated as part of a RIF, there are legal requirements the agencies must follow.\nSee generally 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502; 5 C.F.R. Part 351. And it is undisputed\u2014and indisputable\u2014that\n\nthese requirements apply to probationary employees. See 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.501(a){b). One such\n\naa\n\frequirement is that, whenever a RIF involves at least fifty employees within a competitive area,!\u00b0\n\nthe agency must provide notice to \u201c[t]he State or the entity designated by the State to carry out\nrapid response activities under [the WIOA].\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.803(a). That notice must include (1)\n\u201cIt]he number of employees to be separated from the agency by reduction in force (broken down\nby geographic area or other basis specified by OPM)\u201d; (2) \u201c[t]he effective date of the separations\u201d;\nand (3) \u201c[a]ny other information specified by OPM, including information needs identified from\nconsultation between OPM and the Department of Labor to facilitate delivery of placement and\nrelated services.\u201d Jd. \u00a7 351.803(c).\n\nThe Government did not follow the requisite notice procedures, and it does not attempt to\nargue that it did. Indeed, the Government\u2019s substantive arguments are aimed only at its view that\nit did not conduct RIFs. And the consequence of the Government\u2019s failure to follow the requisite\nnotice procedures is clear: if an agency fails to provide notice, an employee \u201cmay not be released[]\ndue to a reduction in force.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d).\n\nBecause the States have shown that the Government\u2019s actions were highly likely \u201cnot in\n\naccordance with law,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706, they are likely to prevail on the merits of their APA claims.'!\n\n'\u00a9 Although the Court is focused on the lack of requisite notice, there is no evidence that the Government followed\nany of the requisite RIF procedures, including defining the competitive area. But \u201c[a] competitive area may consist\nof all or part of an agency,\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.402, and given the sheer number of terminated employees, it is implausible\nthat the fifty-person threshold necessary to trigger this requirement has not been met. (See, e.g., ECF No. 4-5 {17\n(declaration by the Maryland Secretary of Labor explaining that \u201cthe Maryland Department of Labor has already\nreceived at least 813 claims by ex-federal employees for unemployment benefits\u201d and that it \u201cis also aware of public\nannouncement of significant layoffs at Maryland and D.C.-located federal agencies\u201d); ECF No. 4-7 {| 30 (Declaration\nby the Director of the California Employment Development Department explaining that her office has received \u201c1,621\nclaims by former federal employees for unemployment benefits since February 1, 2025\u201d); ECF No. 4-8 \u00a7 15\n(Declaration by the Deputy Director, Service Delivery of the Illinois Department of Employment Security, explaining\nthat her office has received 446 claims for unemployment insurance by former federal employees); ECF No. 4-13 4 4\n(\u201cFrom January 21 \u2014 February 20, [the New York Department of Labor] received 178 new unemployment claims from\nfederal employees. From February 21 \u2014 February 27, the most recently available data set, [that office] logged an\nadditional 372 new unemployment claims from federal employees.\u201d).)\n\nIn any event, the Government cannot be permitted to skirt RIF notice requirements by simply not defining\nthe competitive area as required, then claiming the preconditions for RIF notice have not been met.\n\n'! Having resolved the matter on the basis of the APA, the Court makes no findings as to the States\u2019 likelihood of\nsuccess on their u/fra vires claim.\n\n40\n\fB. Irreparable Harm\n\u201cTo establish irreparable harm, the movant must make a \u2018clear showing\u2019 that it will suffer\n\n999\n\nharm that is \u2018neither remote nor speculative, but actual and imminent.\u2019\u201d Mountain Valley Pipeline,\nLLC vy. 6.56 Acres of Land, Owned by Sandra Townes Powell, 915 F.3d 197, 216 (4th Cir. 2019)\n(quoting Direx Israel, Ltd. v. Breakthrough Med. Corp., 952 F.2d 802, 812 (4th Cir. 1991)).\nFurther, \u201cthe harm must be irreparable, meaning that it \u2018cannot be fully rectified by the final\njudgment after trial.\u2019\u201d Jd. (quoting Stuller, Inc. v. Steak N Shake Enters., 695 F.3d 676, 680 (7th\nCir. 2012)).\n\nAlthough the harms the States face are largely economic, \u201ceconomic damages may\nconstitute irreparable harm where no remedy is available at the conclusion of litigation.\u201d Mountain\nValley Pipeline, LLC v. W. Pocahontas Props. Ltd. P\u2019ship, 918 F.3d 353, 366 (4th Cir. 2019)\n(citation omitted). Here, the harm is irreparable because money damages are likely not available.\nSee City of New York v. U.S. Dep't of Def., 913 F.3d 423, 430 (4th Cir. 2019) (\u201cThe APA waives\nthe federal government\u2019s sovereign immunity for a limited set of suits, brought by \u2018a person\nsuffering legal wrong because of agency action\u2019 to obtain relief \u2018other than money damages.\u201d\u201d\n(quoting 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702) (emphasis added)); Chef Time 1520 LLC vy.

Admin., 646 F.\nSupp. 3d 101, 115-16 (D.D.C. 2022) (explaining that the unavailability of money damages for\nAPA claims counsels in favor of a finding of irreparable harm).\n\nFurther, even if damages were available, where economic damages are \u201cdifficult to\nascertain,\u201d there may be irreparable harm. Multi-Channel TV Cable Co. v. Charlottesville Quality\nCable Operating Co., 22 F.3d 546, 551 (4th Cir. 1994) (quoting Danielson v. Local 275, 479 F.2d\n1033, 1037 (2d Cir. 1973)). The damages incurred by the States are difficult to ascertain, and an\n\ninjunction is necessary to mitigate the chaos caused by the Government.\n\n41\n\fThe States\u2019 diversion of resources as a result of the lack of notice also constitutes an\nirreparable harm. See HIAS, Inc. v. Trump, 985 F.3d 309, 326 (4th Cir. 2021) (recognizing the\n\u201cdiversion of resources away from . . . core missions\u201d as irreparable); see also District of Columbia\nv. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Agric., 444 F. Supp. 3d 1, 42 (D.D.C. 2020) (explaining that \u201cthe forced diversion\nof resources\u201d has been \u201crecognized as irreparable harm in other suits\u201d (collecting cases).)\n\nIn addition, the notice provision contemplates providing notice sixty days before a RIF.\nThe information to be provided is therefore time sensitive, and the harm itself is temporal and\nimmediate. This likewise weighs in favor of finding that the harm is irreparable. Cf Heritage\nFound. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of State, Civ. No. TIK-24-2862, 2024 WL 4607501, at *10 (D.D.C. Oct. 29,\n2024).\n\nCi Balance of the Equities & the Public Interest\n\nThe final two factors\u2014balance of the equities and weighing the public interest\u2014\u201cmerge\nwhen the Government is the opposing party.\u201d Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009). The\nCourt is mindful that it may not collapse this inquiry with the first Winter factor. See USA Farm\nLab., Inc. v. Micone, No. 23-2108, 2025 WL 586339, at *4 (4th Cir. Feb. 24, 2025) (explaining\nthat it is \u201ccircular reasoning\u201d to argue that a government \u201cprogram is against the public interest\nbecause it is unlawful\u201d and that such argument \u201cis nothing more than a restatement of their\nlikelihood of success argument\u201d).\n\nIn cases such as this, \u201cthe public undoubtedly has an interest in seeing its governmental\ninstitutions follow the law.\u201d Roe, 947 F.3d at 230-31 (internal quotation marks and citation\nomitted). But the public interest goes beyond that. As discussed above, these mass terminations\nconducted without appropriate notice have placed enormous strain on the States. And the public\n\nhas a great interest in the States not unnecessarily diverting resources from other functions. (See,\n\n42\n\fe.g., ECF No. 4-5 \u00a7 27 (Declaration from the Maryland Secretary of Labor that Maryland\nDepartment of Labor personnel \u201chave been diverted from state-funded workforce development\nprojects, including the Employment Advancement Right Now (\u2018EARN\u2019) program, which isa...\nworkforce development grant initiative serving over 5,000 constituents annually\u201d); id 26\n(explaining that state matters that have been affected by the diversion of resources includes\n\u201coccupational and professional licensing oversight, financial regulation, [and] state workforce\ndevelopment programs\u201d); id. \u00a7 58 (explaining that the diversion will also \u201cimpede the timely\nprocessing of regular [unemployment claims], creating significant backlogs and delays\u201d); ECF No.\n4-8 \u00a7 24 (declaration from the Deputy Director, Service Delivery of the Illinois Department of\nEmployment Security providing that \u201cthe diversion of personnel to handle [Unemployment\nCompensation for Federal Employees] claims will impede the timely processing of regular\nunemployment insurance claims, creating backlogs and delays\u201d).) It is in the public interest to\nprovide immediate relief to the States so as to alleviate the extreme burdens placed upon them by\nthe Government. The Court also recognizes that there exists an interest in a presidential\nadministration carrying out its priorities, which may take the form of mass terminations. However,\nthe Court concludes that the public\u2019s interest in governmental institutions following the law, and\nin reducing burdens on the States is greater. These harms to the States\u2014and to the public\u2014will\nbe further exacerbated if emergency relief is not granted.\n\nThe Government argues that a TRO would \u201cimpose significant and unrecoverable costs on\nDefendants.\u201d (ECF No. 20 at 27.) The Court does not discount this reality. However, by the\nGovernment\u2019s own admission, reinstatement of the probationary employees is the only relief that\nwill provide redress to the States. (See ECF No. 20 at 14 (\u201c[T]he States\u2019 asserted injuries could\n\nonly be conceivably redressed by [the employees\u2019 | reinstatement.\u201d); id. at 17 (\u201cTo prevent or stem\n\n43\n\fthe diversion of state assistance resources, the Court again would have to order reinstatement of\nthe removed probationers into their former agency jobs.\u201d).) The Court recognizes the breadth of\nthe relief it will grant, but the Court cannot allow the Government to benefit from chaos of its own\nmaking.\n\nFor instance, in HIAS, 985 F.3d, the Fourth Circuit upheld the district court\u2019s entry of a\npreliminary injunction barring the Government from enforcing an Executive Order concerning\nrefugee resettlement that was found to be likely violative of the federal Refugee Act, 8 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1522. As the Fourth Circuit explained, \u201c[t]he resettlement agencies face enormous burdens to\ncomply with the Order and Notice, as well as the likelihood of affiliates closing entirely in\njurisdictions that refuse consent. In contrast, under the district court\u2019s injunction, the government\nmust continue to implement the refugee resettlement program according to the Act\u2019s well-\nestablished processes refined over several decades.\u201d /d. at 326. So too here, the States are faced\nwith enormous burdens in the face of the Government\u2019s failure to provide notice, and under an\norder reinstating employees and enjoining the Government from further illegal action, the\nGovernment must simply act according to well-established law.\n\nOn balance, the Court finds that the public interest and the equities weigh in favor of\ngranting a TRO.\n\nVI. SCOPE OF RELIEF\n\nA. TRO Purpose & Limitations\n\nBefore turning to the specific relief that will be ordered in this case, it is necessary to review\nfundamental principles about the nature of a TRO and the kinds of relief that are available at the\n\nTRO stage.\n\n44\n\fThe purpose of a preliminary injunction is to preserve the status quo until there is a trial on\nthe merits. Univ. of Tex. v. Camenisch, 451 U.S. 390, 395 (1981). The purpose of a TRO is to\npreserve the status quo until the Court is able to hold a preliminary injunction hearing. Hoechst\nDiafoil Co. v. Nan Ya Plastics Corp., 174 F.3d 411, 422 (4th Cir. 1999). Each \u201caim|[s] to maintain\nthe status quo and prevent irreparable harm while a lawsuit remains pending.\u201d League of Women\nVoters of N.C. v. North Carolina, 769 F.3d 224, 236 (4th Cir. 2014) (citation omitted).\n\nThe Government argues that an order reinstating fired workers would not be a proper\ninvocation of the Court\u2019s authority to \u201crestrain{]\u201d, but would rather be an impermissible\n\u201cmandatory injunction.\u201d (ECF No. 20 at 25 n.9.) The Government is mistaken. A mandatory\ninjunction, which is \u201cdisfavored\u201d and issued in only the \u201cmost extraordinary circumstances,\u201d is\none that changes the status quo. Pierce v. N.C. State Bd. of Elections, 97 F 4th 194, 209 (4th Cir.\n2024). A prohibitory injunction, by contrast, is one that maintains the status quo. League of\nWomen Voters, 769 F.3d at 236. Critically, the \u201cstatus quo,\u201d for purposes of injunctive relief, \u201c\u2018is\nnot the circumstances existing at the moment the lawsuit or injunction request was actually filed,\nbut the last uncontested status between the parties which preceded the controversy.\u201d Aggarao v.\nMOL Ship Mgmt. Co., 675 F.3d 355, 378 (4th Cir. 2012) (citation and internal quotation marks\nomitted). As the Fourth Circuit has recognized, \u201cit is sometimes necessary to require a party who\nhas recently disturbed the status quo to reverse its actions, but such an injunction restores, rather\nthan disturbs, the status quo ante.\u201d League of Women Voters, 769 F.3d at 236 (cleaned up) (quoting\nAggarao, 675 F.3d at 378). As the Second Circuit has explained:\n\nThe \u201cstatus quo\u201d in preliminary-injunction parlance is really a \u201cstatus quo ante.\u201d\n\nSee Holt v. Cont\u2019l Grp., Inc., 708 F.2d 87, 90 (2d Cir. 1983) (referring to\n\nreinstatement of benefits as \u201crestoration of the status quo ante\u201d); accord O Centro\n\nEspirita Beneficiente Uniao Do Vegetal vy. Ashcroft, 389 F.3d 973, 1013 (10th Cir.\n\n2004) (en banc) (per curiam) (\u201c\u2018requir[ing] a party who has recently disturbed the\nstatus quo to reverse its actions . . . restores, rather than disturbs, the status quo ante,\n\n45\n\fand is thus not an exception\u201d to the ordinary standard for preliminary injunctions).\nThis special \u201cante\u201d formulation of the status quo in the realm of equities shuts out\ndefendants seeking shelter under a current \u201cstatus quo\u201d precipitated by their\nwrongdoing.\n\nN. Am. Soccer League, LLC v. U.S. Soccer Fed\u2019n, Inc., 883 F.3d 32, 37 n.5 (2d Cir. 2018).\n\nIt is in the context of the broader conceptual distinction between a prohibitory and\nmandatory injunction that Rule 65\u2019s use of the word \u201crestraining\u201d must be understood. See Warner\nBros. Inc. v. Dae Rim Trading, Inc., 877 F.2d 1120, 1124 (2d Cir. 1989) (stating that a TRO, \u201cby\nthe very word \u2018restraining[,\u2019] should issue only for the purpose of preserving the status quo and\npreventing irreparable harm and for just so long as is necessary to hold a hearing\u201d). This is not a\ncase in which the Court is asked, at the TRO stage, to order a defendant to take on new burdens or\nobligations that it had previously not shouldered. Cf, e.g., Sosa v. Lantz, 660 F. Supp. 2d 283,\n290 (D. Conn. 2009) (declining to issue a TRO that would have required a state prison to move an\ninmate to a larger cell, on the grounds that such an order \u201cwould provide [the inmate] with\naffirmative relief changing the status quo\u201d (emphasis in original)). Instead, the Court is asked to\norder the Government to preserve the situation that existed before it embarked on the likely illegal\nmass terminations without providing requisite notice to the States. Although such an order will\ninevitably require the Government to take affirmative steps to comply, it nevertheless fits\ncomfortably within the scope of the Court\u2019s TRO authority. See 11A Charles Alan Wright &\nArthur R. Miller, Federal Practice & Procedure \u00a7 2951 (3d ed. 2024) (\u201c[A]lthough they are rare,\ntemporary restraining orders can be framed to require affirmative action on the part of the\n\n\u2018restrained\u2019 party.\u201d).!*\n\n'2 Alternatively, as discussed in more detail below, the Court has statutory authority to order appropriate preliminary\nrelief under the APA. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 705.\n\n46\n\fB. Geographic Scope\n\nThe Court must determine the appropriate scope of any injunctive relief. This task \u201cis an\nexercise of discretion and judgment, often dependent as much on the equities of a given case as\nthe substance of the legal issues it presents.\u201d Trump v. Int'l Refugee Assistance Project, 582 U.S.\n571, 579 (2017) (citations omitted). As the Fourth Circuit has explained:\n\nDistrict courts have broad discretion to craft remedies based on the circumstances\n\nof a case, but likewise must ensure that \u201ca preliminary injunction is no more\n\nburdensome to the defendant than necessary to provide complete relief to the\n\nplaintiffs.\u201d Roe v. Dep\u2019t of Def., 947 F.3d 207, 231 (4th Cir. 2020) (citations and\ninternal quotation marks omitted). A district court may issue a nationwide\ninjunction so long as the court \u201c\u2018mold[s] its decree to meet the exigencies of the\n\nparticular case.\u201d Jd. (quoting Trump v. Int'l Refugee Assistance Project, [582 U.S.\n\n571, 580] (2017)). And a nationwide injunction may be appropriate when the\n\ngovernment relies on a \u201ccategorical policy,\u201d and when the facts would not require\n\ndifferent relief for others similarly situated to the plaintiffs. /d. at 232-33.\n\nHIAS, 985 F.3d at 326 (first alteration in original).\n\nIn HIAS, the Fourth Circuit upheld the district court\u2019s entry of a preliminary injunction\nbarring the Government from enforcing an Executive Order concerning refugee resettlement that\nwas found to be likely violative of the federal Refugee Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1522. 985 F.3d at 316-18.\nThe Court held that the district court did not abuse its discretion in enjoining the application of the\nexecutive order nationwide, rather than limiting the relief to the three plaintiff resettlement\n\nagencies. As the panel explained:\n\nThe refugee resettlement program by its nature impacts refugees assigned to all\nnine resettlement agencies, which place refugees throughout the country. Enjoining\nthe Order and Notice only as to the plaintiff resettlement agencies would cause\ninequitable treatment of refugees and undermine the very national consistency that\nthe Refugee Act is designed to protect.\n\nId. at 326-27.\nMuch like how the program challenged in H/AS \u201cimpacts refugees assigned to all nine\n\nresettlement agencies, which place refugees throughout the country,\u201d here, the challenged\n\n47\n\fdismissals without notice apply to federal workers spread throughout the United States. When, as\nis likely the case here, the Government\u2019s policy is violative of the law across the board, it is\nappropriate for injunctive relief to be nationwide in scope, rather than limited to specific plaintiffs.\nSee Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U.S. 682, 702 (1979) (\u201c[T]he the scope of injunctive relief is\ndictated by the extent of the violation established ....\u201d); Cath. Legal Immigr. Network, Inc. v.\nExec. Off. for Immigr. Rev., 513 F. Supp. 3d 154, 178 (D.D.C. 2021) (affirming \u201cthe propriety of\nnationwide injunctions in APA cases where the challenged policy is found to be arbitrary and\ncapricious or otherwise facially unlawful\u201d (citation omitted)); cf Marshall v. Goodyear Tire &\nRubber Co., 554 F.2d 730, 733 (5th Cir. 1977) (\u201c[A] nationwide or companywide injunction is\nappropriate only when the facts indicate a company policy or practice in violation of the statute.\u201d).\nTo limit the scope of the injunction only to Plaintiff States would mean that an individual federal\nemployee\u2019s job status would depend on the fortuity of their physical location, a result that would\nbe inequitable and \u201cundermine . . . national consistency\u201d in the federal workforce and application\nof federal civil service law. HIAS, 985 F.3d at 326. Moreover, any attempt to disaggregate federal\ngovernment\u2014wide employment policy on a state-by-state-level is bound to be unworkable, as it\nwould functionally create two separate, drastically different regimes with respect to probationary\nemployees in each affected agency. In these circumstances, a nationwide injunction\u2014rather than\none tied only to these specific States\u2014is warranted. See CASA, Inc. v. Trump, No. 25-1153, 2025\nWL 654902, at *1 (4th Cir. Feb. 28, 2025) (upholding the district court\u2019s grant of a nationwide\npreliminary injunction when \u201cthe facts would not require different relief for others similarly\n\nsituated\u201d (cleaned up) (quoting H/JAS, 985 F.3d at 326-27)).\n\n48\n\fc Content of the Injunction\n\nUnder the APA, to prevent irreparable injury, the Court \u201cmay issue all necessary and\nappropriate process to postpone the effective date of an agency action or to preserve status or rights\npending conclusion of the review proceedings.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 705. \u201cThe factors governing issuance\nof a preliminary injunction also govern issuance of a \u00a7 705 stay.\u201d Casa de Md., Inc. v. Wolf, 486\nF. Supp. 3d 928, 950 (D. Md. 2020) (quoting District of Columbia v. Dep't of Agric., 444 F. Supp.\nat 16), order dissolved, Civ. No. PX-20-2118, 2023 WL 3547497 (D. Md. May 18, 2023).\nFurthermore, it is well established that the Court \u201cmay craft declaratory and injunctive relief\ndesigned to preclude a federal agency from acting in contravention of its statutory and regulatory\nauthority,\u201d and that it \u201cmay require an agency to modify its current or future practices in order to\n\n\u201d\n\naccount for past violations of its statutes or regulations.\u201d Coal. for Gov't Procurement vy. Fed.\nPrison Indus., Inc., 365 F.3d 435, 460 (6th Cir. 2004) (citations omitted).\n\nThe ordinary remedy for unlawful agency actions is vacatur. See FCC v. NextWave Pers.\nComme ns Inc., 537 U.S. 293, 300 (2003) (\u201cThe [APA] requires federal courts to set aside federal\nagency action that is \u2018not in accordance with law\u2019... .\u201d (quoting 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A))); Sierra\nClub v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Interior, 899 F.3d 260, 270 (4th Cir. 2018) (similar); see also Nat'l Mining\nAss'n v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng\u2019rs, 145 F.3d 1399, 1409 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (\u201cWhen a reviewing\ncourt determines that agency regulations are unlawful, the ordinary result is that the rules are\nvacated\u2014not that their application to the individual petitioners is proscribed.\u201d (cleaned up)).\nAlthough some courts have occasionally endorsed a practice of remanding an agency action to the\nagency for further consideration without vacatur, see Allied-Signal, Inc. v. U.S. Nuclear Reg.\n\nComm\u2019n, 988 F.2d 146, 150-51 (D.C. Cir. 1993), the Fourth Circuit \u201chas never formally embraced\n\nthe Allied-Signal remand-without-vacatur approach.\u201d Sierra Club vy. U.S. Army Corps of Eng\u2019rs,\n\n49\n\f909 F.3d 635, 655 (4th Cir. 2018). Even assuming that remand without vacatur may be appropriate\nin some instances, such a remedy is warranted only when \u201cthere is at least a serious possibility that\nthe [agency] will be able to substantiate its decision on remand.\u201d /d. (quoting Allied-Signal, 988\nF.2d at 150-51 (alteration in original)). Here, however, it is likely that the Government\u2019s actions\nwere plainly contrary to law, and there is no plausible scenario in which the Government\u2019s\nprocedures for terminating probationary employees could be adequately justified on remand to the\nagencies. In such instances, the likely final remedy is that the Government\u2019s actions must be\nvacated in their entirety. See id. (holding that vacatur was required when the challenged actions\nwere \u201clegally deficient\u201d such that there was no realistic possibility of the actions being justified\nupon agency reconsideration).\n\nHere, the Court finds that\u2014just as vacatur would likely be the appropriate remedy at the\nfinal judgment stage under the APA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\u2014the proper provisional remedy under Rule\n65 and \u00a7 705 is a stay of the Government\u2019s efforts to terminate probationary employees en masse\nand without notice to the States. Cf Career Colls. & Schs. of Tex. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Educ., 98 F.4th\n220, 255 (Sth Cir. 2024) (\u201c[W]e conclude that the scope of preliminary relief under Section 705\naligns with the scope of ultimate relief under Section 706, which is not party-restricted and allows\na court to \u2018set aside\u2019 an unlawful agency action.\u201d\u2019), cert. grantedin part, __ 8. Ct.__, 2025 WL\n65914 (Mem.) (Jan. 10, 2025); District of Columbia v. U.S. Dep't of Agric., 444 F. Supp. 3d 1, 49\n(D.D.C. 2020) (\u201cNationwide preliminary injunctive relief guarantees that a rule shown likely to be\nproven unlawful does not become effective, providing complete relief to the plaintiffs while the\nrule\u2019s legality is finally adjudicated.\u201d); see generally Gomez v. Trump, 485 F. Supp. 3d 145, 202\u2014\n04 (D.D.C. 2020) (explaining the relationship between vacatur under \u00a7 706 and enjoining a likely\n\nunlawful agency action under \u00a7 705).\n\n50\n\fOnly an order staying the Government\u2019s likely unlawful RIF process can prevent the States\nfrom suffering irreparable injury in the form of the disruption and costs imposed by the mass\nterminations. Indeed, the Government admits as much. (ECF No. 20 at 14 (\u201c[T]he States\u2019 asserted\ninjuries could only be conceivably redressed by their reinstatement.\u201d (emphasis omitted).) Were\nthe Court to withhold from granting such interim relief, it would likely be impossible adequately\nto remedy the States\u2019 injuries at the final judgment stage, which may be many months if not years\naway. Given the complexity and unprecedented nature of the terminations, it would be difficult,\nif not impossible, to retrospectively assign a dollar amount to the burdens incurred by the States\nfrom the Government\u2019s likely unlawful terminations\u2014and in any event, money damages are likely\ncategorically unavailable in a suit of this type, as discussed above, see supra Section III.B.\n\nAs a practical matter, a stay of the Government\u2019s terminations of probationary employees\nmeans that the Government must reinstate all affected employees working for the Defendant\nAgencies. Then, if the Government wishes to continue pursuing its RIF agenda, the Government\nmust start from square one, acting in compliance with federal law. Only by following the\nprocedures set forth in federal law can the Court ensure that the States receive the notice to which\nthey are statutorily entitled. The Court is not blind to the practical reality that the relief being\nordered today will have far-reaching impacts on the federal workforce and will require the\nGovernment to expend considerable resources in an effort to undo the RIFs that have been put into\nplace. But, as explained above, \u201cthe scope of injunctive relief is dictated by the extent of the\nviolation established.\u201d Califano, 442 U.S. at 702. When, as is likely the case here, the Government\nhas engaged in an illegal scheme spanning broad swaths of the federal workforce, it is inevitable\n\nthat the remediation of that scheme will itself be a significant task.\n\n51\n\fD. Agencies Restrained\n\nThe final issue pertaining to the scope of the TRO is which specific Defendants are to be\nrestrained. As discussed above, there are three agencies named as Defendants in this action\u2014\nnamely, Defense, OPM, and Archives\u2014with respect to which Plaintiffs have provided insufficient\nevidence that RIFs have occurred.'* It is of course axiomatic that a movant is not entitled to a\nTRO against a defendant when the movant has not shown that it is likely to prevail on the merits\nas to that defendant. Accordingly, Defense, OPM, and Archives will be excluded from the TRO.\nThis exclusion is without prejudice to the States\u2019 right, at the preliminary injunction stage, to\nproduce evidence showing that RIFs occurred at these agencies and to seek appropriate relief.\nVI. SECURITY/BOND REQUIREMENT\n\nUnder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(c), a court may issue a TRO \u201conly if the movant\ngives security in an amount that the court considers proper to pay the costs and damages sustained\nby any party found to have been wrongfully enjoined or restrained.\u201d District courts have discretion\nto set the required security at a nominal amount, see Hoechst Diafoil Co., 174 F.3d at 421 n.3, and\nthis approach has long been followed in public-interest litigation cases, Alabama ex rel. Baxley v.\nCorps of Eng\u2019rs of U.S. Army, 411 F. Supp. 1261, 1275-76 (N. D. Ala. 1976) (collecting cases);\nSouth Carolina v. United States, 329 F. Supp. 3d 214, 238 n.35 (D.S.C. 2018) (same), vacated on\nother grounds, 912 F.3d 720 (4th Cir. 2019); Nat'l Ass\u2019n of Diversity Officers in Higher Educ. v.\nTrump, Civ. No. ABA-25-0333, 2025 WL 573764, at *30 (D. Md. Feb. 21, 2025); see also Wright\n\n& Miller, supra, \u00a7 2954.\n\n'S A related issue is the contention urged by counsel for the Government at the TRO hearing\u2014namely, that certain\naffidavits refer to agencies that are not Defendants in this action. In particular, the Government cited to affidavits\nfrom an employee from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (\u201cFEMA\u201d) and the National Oceanic and\nAtmospheric Administration (\u201cNOAA\u201d). (See ECF No. 5-11, 5-15 (affidavits attesting to terminations of probationary\nemployees at FEMA and NOAA, respectively).) But FEMA and NOAA are housed within the Departments of\nHomeland Security and Commerce, respectively, which are expressly named as Defendants. (See ECF No. | at 3-4.)\n\na2\n\fHere, the Court concludes that a nominal bond is appropriate. Although the risk of harm\nto the Government is not remote, the potential cost of an improvidently granted TRO on the federal\ngovernment is too complex to calculate in this expedited proceeding. And even if a dollar amount\ncould be put on the Government\u2019s actions, it would be prohibitive to require plaintiffs to bear up\nfront the total cost of the alleged governmental wrongdoing. Accordingly, the Court will require\neach Plaintiff State to pay a bond of $100.\n\nVII. STAY PENDING APPEAL\nThe Government requests that any order issuing injunctive relief be stayed pending appeal.\n\n(ECF No, 20 at 28.) In deciding whether to issue a stay pending appeal, the Court considers:\n\n(1) whether the stay applicant has made a strong showing that he is likely to succeed\non the merits; (2) whether the applicant will be irreparably injured absent a stay;\n(3) whether issuance of the stay will substantially injure the other parties interested\nin the proceeding; and (4) where the public interest lies.\n\nNken, 556 U.S. at 434 (citation omitted). These factors \u201csubstantial[ly] overlap\u201d with the Winter\nfactors. Id.\n\nIt is generally logically inconsistent for a court to issue a TRO or preliminary injunction\nand then stay that order, as the findings on which those decisions are premised are almost perfect\nopposites. See, e.g., PFLAG, Inc. v. Trump, Civ. No. 25-337-BAH, 2025 WL 685124, at #32 (D.\nMd. Mar. 4, 2025) (granting a request for a preliminary injunction, then denying a request for a\nstay pending appeal \u201c[fJor all the [same] reasons\u201d). Here, the stay applicant (i.e., the Government)\nhas not made a strong showing of likelihood of success on the merits; indeed, the Court concluded\nthat the Government will likely /ose on the merits. Accordingly, for the reasons stated above in\nthe discussion of the Winter factors, the Government\u2019s request for a stay pending appeal will be\n\ndenied.\n\n53\n\fIX. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the reasons stated herein, a TRO will issue.\n\nDated this / S day of March, 2025.\n\nBY THE COURT:\n\nPam FB.\n\nLP wba\n\nJames K. Bredar\nUnited States District Judge\n\n54\n",

My name is                 and I am an adult resident of                Maryland.\n\n       2.      I began working for the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) as a\n\n\n\n                         on February 25, 2024. My duty station was Rockville, Maryland.\n\n       3.      From the date of my hire, HHS classified me as a probationary employee. My\n\nprobationary period was one year, or until February 25, 2025.\n\n       4.      On February 14, 2025, I received by email a notice signed by                  that\n\nHHS was terminating my employment, effective March 14, 2025. See Exhibit 1. Four days\n\nlater, on February 18, 2025, I received a second, nearly identical notice that was also signed by\n\n                See Exhibit 2. The second notice moved up the effective date of my termination\n\nto February 23, 2025.\n\n\n\n                                                  1\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 33-2         Filed 03/12/25      Page 3 of 11\n\n\n\n       5.       Both notices state, \u201cthe Agency finds that you are not fit for continued\n\nemployment because your ability, knowledge and skills do not fit the Agency\u2019s current needs,\n\nand your performance has not been adequate to justify further employment at the Agency.\u201d\n\n       6.       The February 14, 2025, termination notice from                  was the first I had\n\nlearned of my termination. If I had more warning, I would have started looking for a new\n\nposition immediately.\n\n       7.       I know of many other probationary employees at HHS that received this same\n\ntermination letter. I understand that 37 probationary employees within the\n\n              were terminated on or around February 14, 2025. I also understand that 180\n\nprobationary employees across all divisions and bureaus of           were terminated on or around\n\nFebruary 14, 2025.\n\n       8.       I am now unemployed, and I have not received any severance pay following my\n\nabrupt termination. I have applied for unemployment insurance benefits with the Maryland\n\ngovernment.\n\n       9.       I can no longer afford to support the local economy in the same way. If I do not\n\nfind a job in the next few months, I will likely need to move in with my parents or other family\n\nmembers.\n\n       10.      As a resident, I pay income taxes to Maryland. Each pay period, HHS withheld\n\nand paid income taxes from my paycheck to the Maryland government.\n\n       11.      Before I was terminated, my job duties as a\n\n\n\n\n       12.      I was a\n\n\n\n                                                 2\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 33-2        Filed 03/12/25     Page 4 of 11\n\n\n\n       13.     In the one year I worked at HHS, I received one mid-cycle performance\n\nevaluation during which I discussed my annual performance plan with my supervisor. My\n\nsupervisor gave me positive feedback about my performance. Additionally, on February 5, 2025,\n\njust nine days before I first learned that I was being terminated, my supervisor had informed me\n\nthat she had submitted paperwork to promote me from the                                   I was\n\ntold that my promotion would be effective February 23, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nDated: March 6, 2025\n\n\n                                                    *A copy of the signature page bearing an\n                                                    original signature is attached hereto.\n\n\n\n\n                                                3\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB   Document 33-2   Filed 03/12/25   Page 5 of 11\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB   Document 33-2   Filed 03/12/25   Page 6 of 11\n\n\n\n\n                  EXHIBIT 1\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB   Document 33-2   Filed 03/12/25   Page 7 of 11\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB   Document 33-2   Filed 03/12/25   Page 8 of 11\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB   Document 33-2   Filed 03/12/25   Page 9 of 11\n\n\n\n\n                  EXHIBIT 2\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB               Document 33-2           Filed 03/12/25        Page 10 of 11\n\n        DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH & HUMAN SERVICES                                          Office of the Secretary\n\n\n                                                                                       Washington, D.C. 20201\n\n\n                                             February 14, 2025\n\n\n\n      MEMORANDUM FOR\n\n\n      FROM:\n\n\n\n\n      SUBJECT:                    Notification of Termination During Probationary Period\n      REFERENCES:                 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7511\n                                  5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3321(a)\n                                  5 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 315.803 and 804\n                                  5 C.F.R. \u00a7 316.304\n\n             This is to provide notification that I am removing you from your position of\n                             and federal service consistent with the above references.\n             On 2/25/2024, the agency appointed you to the position of\n                    As documented on your appointment Standard Form 50 (SF-50), your\n      appointment is subject to a probationary/trial period.

My name is               and I am an adult resident of Washington, D.C.\n\n       2.      I began working for the U.S. Agency for International Development (\u201cUSAID\u201d)\n\n                                                                                          on\n\napproximately December 2, 2024. My duty station was Washington, D.C.\n\n       3.      I am an active duty Air Force veteran. I currently serve in the Air Force Reserves.\n\n       4.      From the date of my hire, USAID classified me as a probationary employee. My\n\nprobationary period was one year, or until approximately December 1, 2025.\n\n       5.      On February 24, 2025, I received by email a memorandum signed by\n\n                                                                          that USAID was\n\nterminating my employment, effective immediately, on the basis that \u201cit is in the best interest of\n\nthe U.S. Government.\u201d See Exhibit 1. The memorandum did not identify any issue with my\n\nperformance or conduct, nor did it identify any conditions arising before my appointment to\n\njustify my termination.\n\n                                                 1\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 33-3        Filed 03/12/25      Page 3 of 9\n\n\n\n       6.      The February 24, 2025 termination notice from                       was the first I\n\nhad learned of my termination. If I had more warning, I would have started looking for a new\n\nposition immediately.\n\n       7.      I am now unemployed, aside from my periodic reservist duties. I plan to apply\n\nfor unemployment insurance benefits with the D.C. government if I am eligible.\n\n       8.      I can no longer afford to support the local economy in the same way due to the\n\nsudden termination. For example, I have canceled plans to eat out at restaurants and order\n\ndelivery, and will need to drive outside of the city to Maryland or Virginia for cheaper groceries.\n\nI will likely not renew my fitness memberships and class passes after February, and have to cut\n\ndown on all other recreational expenses, dissuading me patronizing any establishments for\n\ngatherings with my friends and community members. I also will likely have to put off upcoming\n\nhealthcare needs for my pets. Prior to my termination, I was also planning to buy property within\n\nD.C., with the help of my Veteran Affairs benefits, but am no longer searching due to the\n\nunexpected termination of my job.\n\n       9.      If I do not find a new job in the District in the next few months, I will need to\n\nrelocate out of the District, and may need to terminate my rental lease early to do so.\n\n       10.     Prior to my termination, my job duties\n\n\n\n\n                                                 2\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB         Document 33-3        Filed 03/12/25     Page 4 of 9\n\n\n\n       11.\n\n\n\n       12.    As a resident of the District of Columbia, I pay income taxes to the District. Each\n\npay period, USAID withheld and paid income taxes from my paycheck to the District\n\ngovernment.\n\n       13.    I received one midterm review during my two and a half months at USAID,\n\nduring which my supervisor and I discussed my progress on my performance plan and we both\n\nexecuted a Form AID 462-1, acknowledging we conducted this review. My supervisor gave me\n\npositive feedback regarding my performance.\n\n       14.    I am in contact with many other probationary employees at USAID that received\n\nthis same termination letter. I believe my agency terminated roughly 200 probationary employees\n\non February 24, 2025.\n\n\n\nDated: March 5, 2025\n\n\n\n\n                                               3\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB   Document 33-3   Filed 03/12/25   Page 5 of 9\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB   Document 33-3   Filed 03/12/25   Page 6 of 9\n\n\n\n\n                  Exhibit 1\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB   Document 33-3   Filed 03/12/25   Page 7 of 9\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB        Document 33-3        Filed 03/12/25     Page 8 of 9\nProbationary Termination\nPage 2\n\n       whichever is later.

Chapter 12, by filing a complaint with the Office of Special Counsel (OSC).\n       After a complaint is filed with OSC, you may file an Individual Right of Action (IRA)\n       appeal with the MSPB.\n\n       PLEASE READ CAREFULLY BEFORE CHOOSING AN OPTION UNDER THIS SECTION:\n\n       If you choose option 3 above and first seek corrective action by filing a complaint with\n       OSC, your subsequent appeal to the MSPB will be deemed an IRA appeal. Pursuant to\n       5 C.F.R. Section 1209.2, you will be limited to the rights associated with an IRA appeal.\n       Specifically, the MSPB will only consider whether you have demonstrated that one or\n       more whistleblowing disclosures was a contributing factor in the Agency taking this\n       personnel action against you, and if so, whether the Agency has demonstrated by\n       clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken this personnel action in the\n       absence of the protected disclosure or disclosures. You may not raise affirmative\n       defenses other than reprisal for whistleblowing activities, such as claims of\n       discrimination or harmful procedural error.\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB         Document 33-3       Filed 03/12/25     Page 9 of 9\nProbationary Termination\nPage 3\n\n       If you have any questions about your appeal rights, you may contact HCTM/ELR at\nhctm.elr@usaid.gov.

I began working for the U.S. Department of Housing & Urban Development\n\n(\u201cHUD\u201d) as\n\n                                         on approximately January 13, 2025. My duty station was\n\nWashington, D.C.\n\n       3.      From the date of my hire, HUD classified me as a probationary employee. My\n\nprobationary period was one year, or until approximately January 12, 2026.\n\n       4.      On February 14, 2025, I received by email a Notice of Termination from\n\n            stating that HUD was terminating my employment, effective immediately, \u201cin order\n\nto promote the efficiency of the federal service in accordance with the priorities of the\n\nAdministration.\u201d See Exhibit 1.

Failure to return government property may result in a deduction of your\npaycheck. Any personal items left behind in your work area will be mailed to your current address of\nrecord. Please let your supervisor know if you have changed your mailing address.\n\nIf you had opted into the Deferred Resignation Program by messaging OPM prior to its closing at 7:20pm\nET on February 12, 2025, you will receive an Agreement to sign and will be allowed to resign or retire in\naccordance with the terms of the program. If you believe you opted into the program and are receiving\nthis notice in error, please contact DeferredResignationQuestions@HUD.Gov for verification. Please\nannotate Probationary Verification in the subject line.\n\nYou are advised that you do not have a right to reply to this personnel action or to grieve your termination\nunder either the administrative or negotiated grievance procedure. However, if you believe you received\nthis notice in error because you are not currently in a trial period, please send an e-mail to:\nProbationaryNotice@hud.gov with the subject \u201cVerification of Probationary Status.\u201d\n\nIf you believe that the Department discriminated against you on the basis of your race, color, religion, sex,\nnational origin, age, disability, genetic information, and/or reprisal, you may file a complaint of\ndiscrimination. In order to pursue this matter through the discrimination complaints process, you must\n\f          Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 33-4        Filed 03/12/25      Page 8 of 8\n\n\n\ncontact a HUD EEO Counselor within 45 days of the effective date of this adverse action. A HUD EEO\nCounselor may be contacted through the HUD Office of Departmental Equal Employment Opportunity\n(ODEEO) by telephone at (202) 708-3362 or by writing to:\n\n                              Department of Housing and Urban Development\n                              Director of EEO\n                              451 7th Street, S.W., Room 2102\n                              Washington, D.C. 20410\n\nShould you elect to file a complaint of discrimination, your complaint will be processed in accordance\nwith 29 CFR \u00a7 1614.\nIf you believe this termination is being taken against you in reprisal for acts covered under the\nWhistleblower Protection Enhancement Act, you may seek corrective action by filing a complaint with\nthe Office of Special Counsel (OSC) (see www.osc.gov). If you choose to file a complaint with OSC,\nand if OSC does not take corrective action, you may then file an Individual Right of Action (IRA)\nappeal with the MSPB. In an IRA appeal, the only issues before the MSPB are those listed in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\n1221(e), i.e., whether the appellant has demonstrated that a protected disclosure or protected activity was\na contributing factor in one or more covered personnel actions and, if so, whether the agency has\ndemonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action(s) in\nthe absence of the protected disclosure(s). Other than raising an affirmative defense of reprisal for\nwhistleblowing activities, other affirmative defenses, such as claims of discrimination or harmful\nprocedural error, may not be raised. In an IRA appeal that concerns an adverse action under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\n7512, the agency need not prove its charges, nexus, or the reasonableness of the penalty.\n\nYour election of one of these avenues of review will be considered final on the date any appeal or\ncomplaint is filed.\n\f",

From the date of my hire, DOL classified me as a probationary employee. My\n\n        probationary period was one year, or until approximately April 21, 2025.\n\n     4. On February 20, 2025, I received by email a Notification of Termination During\n\n        Probationary Period (\u201cTermination Notice), signed by                    stating that DOL\n\n        was terminating my employment, effective March 7, 2025.

I believe many other probationary employees at GSA that received this same\n\ntermination letter. I believe my agency terminated more than 100 probationary employees the\n\nweek of February 10, 2025.\n\n        7.     I will be unemployed after my termination effective date of March 7, 2025. I plan\n\nto apply for unemployment insurance benefits with the D.C. government.\n\n        8.     Because of my termination, I will not be able to support D.C.\u2019s local economy in\n\nthe same way. My family and I have had to scale back our spending significantly, including not\n\neating out at restaurants as often and shopping for groceries outside of D.C. where groceries are\n\ncheaper. We also will likely need to cancel my children\u2019s enrollment at a summer camp in the\n\nDistrict.\n\n        9.     As a resident of the District of Columbia, I pay income taxes to the District.

My duty\n\nstation was Washington, D.C.\n\n       3.     From the date of my hire, ED classified me as a probationary employee. My\n\nprobationary period was one year, or until approximately August 10, 2025.\n\n       4.     On February 12, 2025, I received by email a Notification of Termination during\n\nProbationary/Trial Period (\u201cTermination Notice\u201d) from                 See Exhibit 1.

The February 12, 2025 Termination Notice was the first I had learned of my\n\ntermination. If I had more warning, I would have started looking for a new position\n\nimmediately.\n\n        6.      I know of several other probationary employees at ED that received this same\n\ntermination letter.\n\n        7.      I am now unemployed. I plan to apply for unemployment insurance benefits with\n\nthe D.C. government. I may need to apply for Medicaid and other public assistance programs.\n\n        8.      I can no longer afford to support the local economy of D.C. or Maryland in the\n\nsame way. I commuted into the District for work and paid for parking and lunch around my\n\noffice. I also frequently went out to restaurants in the District after work. On the weekends, I\n\nwas often in the District at restaurants, bars, clubs, and museums. Because I am now\n\nunemployed, I will be in the District much less often, both because I will no longer be\n\ncommuting to work and also because I will need to scale back my spending significantly.\n\n        9.      I will also need to scale back my spending significantly in Maryland. I am in the\n\nprocess of building a new house in Maryland and if I do not find a new job soon, I may not get\n\napproved for my mortgage or be able to afford mortgage payments.\n\n        10.     As a resident of Maryland, I pay income taxes to the state of Maryland. Each pay\n\nperiod, ED withheld and paid income taxes from my paycheck to the state of Maryland.\n\n        11.

I began working for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (\u201cFEMA\u201d) as a\n\n\n\n            on approximately July 14, 2024. My duty station was Washington, D.C.\n\n       3.      From the date of my hire, FEMA classified me as a probationary employee.\n\nBecause I was a Presidential Management Fellow, my probationary period was two years, or\n\nuntil approximately July 13, 2026.\n\n       4.      On February 17, 2025, I received by email a notice signed by\n\nstating that FEMA was terminating my employment, effective immediately.

I was not aware that I would be terminated prior to February 17, 2025. If I had\n\nmore warning, I would have started looking for a new position immediately.\n\n       6.      I know of many other probationary employees at FEMA that received this same\n\ntermination letter.

Although I am a Virginia resident I regularly travel into D.C. and participate in\n\nthe local economy, I will not be able to do so in the same way. As a commuter to D.C., I spent\n\nmoney on lunch, parking, and Metro fare in the District, and I frequently went to D.C.\n\nrestaurants and sports events, all of which I will need to scale back significantly or stop entirely.\n\nI will likely not be able to renew my membership with the Washington Canoe Club.\n\n       9.

My name is                   and I am an adult resident of Washington, D.C.\n\n       2.      I began working for the Department of Energy (\u201cDOE\u201d) as a\n\n        in                                                        on approximately April 8,\n\n2024. My duty station was Washington, D.C.\n\n       3.      From the date of my hire, DOE classified me as a probationary employee. My\n\nprobationary period was one year, or until approximately April 7, 2025.\n\n       4.      On February 13, 2025, I received by email a Notification of Termination During\n\nProbationary/Trial Period signed by                   that DOE was terminating my\n\nemployment, effective immediately, on the basis that my \u201cfurther employment would not be in\n\nthe public interest.\u201d See Exhibit 1. The email did not identify any issue with my performance or\n\nconduct, nor did it identify any conditions arising before my appointment to justify my\n\ntermination.\n\n\n\n                                                1\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 33-12          Filed 03/12/25      Page 3 of 8\n\n\n\n         5.    The February 13, 2025 termination notice was the first I had learned of my\n\ntermination. If I had more warning, I would have started looking for a new position\n\nimmediately.\n\n         6.    I know of other probationary employees at DOE that received this same\n\ntermination letter. I believe DOE terminated more than 40 probationary employees in my office\n\nalone.\n\n         7.    I am now unemployed. I plan to apply for unemployment insurance benefits with\n\nthe D.C. government. I will also need to sign up for health insurance using the District\u2019s health\n\ninsurance marketplace.\n\n         8.    I can no longer afford to support the local economy in the same way. For\n\nexample, I will not be able to go to restaurants, bars, or coffee shops in the District as often, I\n\nwill not attend sports events, and will stop attending shows at local establishments like the\n\nKennedy Center. If I do not find a new job in the next few months, I will relocate out of the\n\nDistrict.\n\n         9.    As a resident of the District of Columbia, I pay income taxes to the District. Each\n\npay period, DOE withheld and paid income taxes from my paycheck to the District government.\n\n         10.   I was a\n\n         11.

On February 11, 2025, I received by email a notice signed by\n\n                                      that CFPB was terminating my employment, effective\n\nFebruary 10, 2025, on the basis that I was \u201cnot a fit for continued employment\u201d because my\n\n\u201cability, knowledge and skills do not fit the Agency\u2019s current needs.\u201d The email did not identify\n\nany issue with my performance or conduct, nor did it identify any conditions arising before my\n\nappointment to justify my termination. See Exhibit 1.\n\n                                                1\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB   Document 33-14   Filed 03/12/25   Page 3 of 6\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB    Document 33-14   Filed 03/12/25   Page 4 of 6\n\n\n\n\n                         Exhibit 1\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB   Document 33-14   Filed 03/12/25   Page 5 of 6\n\f        Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 33-14         Filed 03/12/25       Page 6 of 6\n\n\n\n                 If you believe this action is being taken based on partisan political reasons or marital\n        status, you have a right to file an appeal with the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB)\n        under 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.806.

I am a resident of             Rhode Island and am over the age of 18.\n\n       2.     I began working for the Environmental Protection Agency (the \u201cEPA\u201d) as an\n\n                                        in\n\n                                                 on or about December 29, 2024. My duty station\n\nwas located in Boston, Massachusetts.\n\n       3.     From the date of my hire, the EPA classified me as a probationary employee. My\n\nprobationary period was one (1) year, or until approximately December 28, 2025.\n\n       4.     On Thursday, February 6, 2025, after about five (5) weeks on the job, I was\n\nsummoned to a meeting with regional EPA staff and told that I was being placed on administrative\n\nleave indefinitely. Shortly after that meeting, I received an email, from the email address\n\nNotice1@epa.gov, similarly advising me that I was being placed on administrative leave. I was\n\n\n\n\n                                                 1\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 33-17         Filed 03/12/25      Page 3 of 11\n\n\n\nadvised that my administrative leave was effective at the end of my tour of duty that same day. Job\n\nperformance was not given as a reason for me being placed on leave.\n\n       5.      I am aware of four (4) other probationary employees on my                 team who\n\nreceived the same email on February 6, 2024, placing them on administrative leave.\n\n       6.      On Tuesday, February 18, 2025, while on administrative leave, I received an email,\n\nsent to my personal email address from the email address Notice2@epa.gov, notifying me that I\n\nwas being terminated. The email referred appeals to                     Assistant General Counsel,\n\nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of General Counsel. The email stated as the reason\n\nfor my termination that I \u201cfailed to demonstrate fully [my] qualifications for continued\n\nemployment.\u201d See Exhibit 1. The email did not identify any issues with my performance or\n\nconduct, nor did it identify any conditions arising before my appointment to justify my termination.\n\n       7.      I am aware of other probationary employees on my                    team who were\n\nterminated on or around the same time as me.\n\n       8.      The February 18, 2025 termination notice to my personal email was the first I had\n\nlearned of my termination. I work in a small, highly specialized field and finding a job often takes\n\nseveral months, if not longer.\n\n       9.      I was receiving health insurance through my job at the EPA. After I was terminated,\n\nI filed for Medicaid benefits, which in Rhode Island is administered and managed by the Executive\n\nOffice of Health and Human Services (\u201cEOHHS\u201d).\n\n       10.     Since losing my job, I can no longer afford to support the local economy in the\n\nsame way. For example, I stopped eating out at restaurants and ordering food delivery. I also cut\n\ndown on all other recreational expenses, stopped patronizing local establishments for gatherings\n\nwith my friends and community members. I was also planning to buy property in Rhode Island or\n\n\n\n\n                                                 2\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 33-17         Filed 03/12/25      Page 4 of 11\n\n\n\nMassachusetts (I live in Rhode Island but on the Massachusetts border), but stopped searching due\n\nto the unexpected termination of my job. Additionally, it is likely that I will no longer be able to\n\npursue an advanced degree at the University of Rhode Island. I had been planning on taking classes\n\nin the Masters of Environmental Science and Management program part-time beginning Fall of\n\n2025. However, without stable income, I will no longer be able to afford tuition.\n\n       11.     Because I worked in Massachusetts, I also paid nonresident income taxes to\n\nMassachusetts. Each pay period, the EPA withheld and paid income taxes from my paycheck to\n\nthe Massachusetts government.\n\n       12.     Before I was terminated, my job duties as an\n\nat            included\n\n\n\n\n       13.     I was a                and earned a salary of approximately            per year.\n\n       14.     At the time of my termination, I had not undergone any performance reviews or\n\nevaluations, and in the six (6) weeks I was employed by the EPA, no one had communicated to me\n\nthat there were any problems with my performance.\n\nDated: March 6, 2025                                 Signed:\n\n\n                                                     *A copy of the signature page bearing an\n                                                     original signature is attached hereto.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 3\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB   Document 33-17   Filed 03/12/25   Page 5 of 11\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB   Document 33-17   Filed 03/12/25   Page 6 of 11\n\n\n\n\n                   Exhibit 1\n\f    Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB                 Document 33-17                 Filed 03/12/25   Page 7 of 11\n\n\nFrom:\nTo:\nSubject:        Fwd: Notification of Termination During Probationary Period\nDate:           Wednesday, March 5, 2025 5:13:36 PM\n\n\n\n\n[External email: Use caution with links and attachments]\n\n\n\n---------- Forwarded message ---------\nFrom: Notice2 <Notice2@epa.gov>\nDate: Tue, Feb 18, 2025 at 11:10 AM\nSubject: Notification of Termination During Probationary Period\nTo:\n\n\n\n\n      SUBJECT:                     Notification of Termination During Probationary Period\n\n      REFERENCES:                        5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7511\n\n                                   5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3321(a)\n\n                                   5 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 315.803 and 804\n\n                                   5 C.F.R. \u00a7 316.304\n\n\n\nThis is to provide notification that the Agency is removing you from your position and federal\nservice consistent with the above references.\n\n\n\nAs documented on your appointment Standard Form 50 (SF-50), your appointment is subject\nto a probationary/trial period.

If you do not submit an appeal within the time\nset by statute, regulation, or order of a judge, it will be dismissed as untimely filed unless\na good reason for the delay is shown. The judge will provide you an opportunity to\nshow why the appeal should not be dismissed as untimely. A copy of the form is\navailable by request if you are unable to access it at the MSPB website. Please refer to\nthe MSPB website (www.mspb.gov) for information regarding the appeals process and\nprocedures that must be followed. You may be represented by an attorney or other\nrepresentative of your choice. If you believe this action was taken against you for\ndiscriminatory reasons, refer to the paragraph on EEOC. If you decide to file an appeal\nwith MSPB, you should notify the Board that the agency\u2019s point of contact for this\nappeal is Ochcofrontoffice@va.gov\n\n       Office of Special Counsel (OSC): If you elect to request corrective action by the\nOSC\u2019s Complaints Examining Unit (OSC Appeal Form) (https://osc.gov/), your\ncomplaint will be limited to a determination as to whether the agency took one or more\npersonnel actions against you in violation of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b) (prohibited personnel\n\n                                                                                      EXHIBIT A\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB         Document 33-19        Filed 03/12/25      Page 8 of 9\n\npractices). This can include, but is not limited to, claims of reprisal for whistleblowing\nand/or engaging in protected activity. If you are not a supervisor and you elect to request\ncorrective action with OSC, you will have waived your right to file an appeal with\nMSPB (if eligible), regarding the same matter, except as follows. If you are making a\ncovered claim of retaliation for engaging in certain protected activities, or for making\nprotected disclosures and OSC terminates its investigation and/or has not timely notified\nyou it will seek corrective action, you may have the right to file an individual right of\naction (IRA) appeal to the MSPB. Such an appeal will be limited to an adjudication of\nwhether you proved that your protected activity or disclosure was a contributing factor in\nthe effected action (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1214; 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1221). If you are a supervisor, you may\npursue remedies from MSPB and OSC concurrently.\n\n\n\n        If you are not a supervisor, whichever option you may choose to pursue\nregarding this action (an appeal to the MSPB, a request for corrective action to OSC, or a\ndiscrimination complaint), shall be considered an election by you to proceed under that\nappeal process. However, if you are not a supervisor, you may still concurrently file a\ncorrective action to OSC and a discrimination complaint. If you are a supervisor, you\nmay elect all three remedies concurrently.\n\n\n\n        Separating VA employees are required to return their PIV card to their PIV\nissuing office and their government furnished IT equipment and peripherals to the Office\nof Information Technology (OIT) for redeployment or disposition.\n\n\n\n       GFE Equipment\n\n       You will immediately take your equipment to the closest VA medical center or\n810 Vermont Avenue to turn in your IT equipment. The local OIT staff will collect all\nassigned government furnished equipment (GFE), including peripherals such as\nmonitors, docking stations, printers, etc.\n\n\n\n      Regardless of the original issuing site, all local IT teams will accept returned\nGFE and will adhere to local procedures for equipment accountability.\n\n\n\n       A return receipt for the equipment will be issued to the employee by local IT staff\nto acknowledge receipt of the employee\u2019s GFE and peripherals.\n\n       OIT Facility Requirements\n\n         Return any non-IT equipment, office and/or card keys, and PIV card to local\nfacility.\n\n       If there is lost equipment a report of survey needs to be completed before you\n\n                                                                                    EXHIBIT A\n\f    Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB         Document 33-19       Filed 03/12/25     Page 9 of 9\n\n     separate.\n\n\n\n\n            We appreciate your service to the Agency and wish you the greatest of success in\n     your future endeavors.

The action has\n\nno hope of success, because third parties cannot interject themselves into the employment\n\nrelationship between the United States and government workers, which is governed by a\n\ncomprehensive statutory scheme that provides an exclusive remedial avenue to challenge adverse\n\npersonnel actions. The States cannot circumvent that channeling scheme by asserting downstream\n\nharm from those employment actions. Nor do the States have any legitimate claims of their own.\n\nThe Court should therefore deny their motion for a temporary restraining order (\u201cTRO\u201d).\n\n       Notably, this is not the first lawsuit to seek this relief. A set of unions sued in federal court\n\nin the District of Columbia a few weeks ago to rescind the termination of the probationary workers.\n\nNational Treasury Employees Union (NTEU) v. Trump, No. 25-cv-420 (CRC), 2025 WL 561080,\n\nat *1 (Feb. 20, 2025). The district court denied relief based on the exclusive channeling regime.\n\nSee id. Then, other unions and organizational plaintiffs sued in the Northern District of California,\n\nalso claiming downstream harms from the terminations. While the court there agreed to restrain\n\nsince-revised guidance on probationary removals from the Office of Personnel Management\n\n(OPM), it acknowledged that it could not and would not rescind terminations. See Am. Fed\u2019n of\n\nGov\u2019t Emps. (AFGE) v. Ezell, et al., No. C 25-01780 WHA (N.D. Cal).\n\n       The third time is not the charm. Like the unions and the organizational plaintiffs, the States\n\nare strangers to the employment relationships at issue, and cannot disrupt the exclusive remedial\n\nscheme that Congress put in place to adjudicate these disputes. Beyond that, the States fail to\n\nidentify any act Defendants have taken inconsistent with law. Nor can they carry their burden to\n\nestablish irreparable harm or that the public interest favors the extraordinary relief they seek.\n\n\n\n                                                  1\n\f                                         BACKGROUND\n\n    I.      Statutory and Regulatory Background\n\n         Probationers are individuals whose employment with the federal government has not been\n\nfinalized. See 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.804. \u201cThe purpose of the probationary period is to provide the\n\nGovernment with an opportunity to evaluate an individual\u2019s conduct and performance on the job\n\nto determine if an appointment to the civil service should become final.\u201d Merit Systems Protection\n\nBoard, \u201cThe Probationary Period: A Critical Assessment Opportunity\u201d i (August 2005).1 The\n\nprobationary period enables agencies \u201cto determine an individual\u2019s potential to fulfill the needs of\n\nthe specific position, the agency, and the civil service.\u201d Id. at ii. Probationers should \u201cbe assessed\n\nin light of the organization\u2019s strategic goals and the role of the position in the accomplishment of\n\nthose goals.\u201d Id. at 22. \u201cUntil the probationary period has been completed, a probationer is still an\n\napplicant for an appointment, with the burden to demonstrate why it is in the public interest for the\n\nGovernment to finalize an appointment to the civil service for this particular individual.\u201d Id.\n\nTermination is mandatory where this showing is not made; an \u201cagency . . . shall terminate [a\n\nprobationer\u2019s] services . . . if the employee fails to demonstrate fully his or her qualifications for\n\ncontinued employment.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.803(a).\n\n         Employment-related disputes between federal employees and their employing agencies\n\nwithin the Executive Branch\u2014including challenges to employee removals or terminations\u2014are\n\ngoverned by the comprehensive, reticulated administrative-judicial review scheme set forth in the\n\nCivil Service Reform Act of 1978, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2101 et seq. That expansive scheme also includes\n\nparallel provisions governing labor relations between agencies and their employees, the Federal\n\n\n1\n  See\nhttps://www.mspb.gov/studies/studies/The_Probationary_Period_A_Critical_Assessment_Oppor\ntunity_224555.pdf.\n                                                  2\n\fService Labor-Management Relations Statute (\u201cthe Statute\u201d or \u201cFSL-MRS\u201d), set forth in Title VII\n\nof the CSRA (codified at 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7101-35). Taken as a whole, the scheme governs nearly all\n\naspects of the federal employer-employee relationship, and largely covers the field when it comes\n\nto judicial rights and remedies for alleged constitutional and statutory violations arising out of that\n\nrelationship. As the D.C. Circuit has put it, \u201cwhat you get under the CSRA is what you get.\u201d\n\nFornaro v. James, 416 F.3d 63, 67 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (then-Judge Roberts).\n\n       Relevant here, the CSRA \u201cestablishe[s] a comprehensive system for reviewing personnel\n\naction taken against federal employees.\u201d Elgin v. Dep\u2019t of the Treasury, 567 U.S. 1, 5 (2012)\n\n(citation omitted). If an agency takes a statutorily defined major adverse action against a covered\n\nemployee\u2014including removal, see 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7512\u2014the employee may appeal that action to the\n\nMerit Systems Protection Board (\u201cMSPB\u201d) under the provisions of the CSRA\u2019s Chapter 75. Id.\n\n\u00a7 7513(d). The MSPB may order relief to prevailing employees, including reinstatement, backpay,\n\nand attorney\u2019s fees. Id. \u00a7\u00a7 1204(a)(2), 7701(g). Final MSPB decisions generally are appealable to\n\nthe Federal Circuit, which has \u201cexclusive jurisdiction\u201d over such appeals. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(9).\n\nThis review scheme is \u201cexclusive, even for employees who bring constitutional challenges to\n\nfederal statutes.\u201d Elgin, 567 U.S. at 13. Other than limited circumstances, it does not permit\n\ncovered employees to bring suit in federal district court. Id. at 14-15; United States v. Fausto, 484\n\nU.S. 439, 447 (1988); Fornaro, 416 F.3d at 67.\n\n       Terminated probationers generally do not enjoy the same guaranteed right to appeal\n\nremoval decisions to the MSPB, as Congress placed them outside the definition of \u201cemployee[s]\u201d\n\nfor purposes of the CSRA\u2019s Chapter 75. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7511(a)(1). Instead, probationers remain\n\nproperly considered \u201capplicants\u201d under the extended hiring and evaluation period the CSRA sets\n\nforth for new career employees. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7511(a)(1)(A)-(B), (C); 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.801,\n\n\n\n                                                  3\n\f301.806.2 But that does not leave them without recourse for alleged constitutional or statutory\n\nviolations by their employing agencies: the CSRA\u2019s Chapter 23, which sets forth the merit system\n\nprinciples underlying the entire statutory scheme and provides remedies for alleged violations of\n\nthose principles, generally applies to both \u201capplicants and employees.\u201d See, e.g., 5 U.S.C.\n\n\u00a7 2302(a)(2)(A)(i)\u2013(xii) (identifying \u201cpersonnel action[s]\u201d that may form the basis for alleged\n\nprohibited personnel practices \u201cwith respect to an employee in, or applicant for, a covered position\n\nin any agency\u201d).\n\n       Thus, probationers whose employment has been terminated by their employing agencies\n\nmay in appropriate circumstances pursue relief that may result in MSPB adjudication, with judicial\n\nreview potentially available after the completion of that process. There are at least two routes to\n\nsuch review. First, a removed probationer may file a complaint alleging one or more statutorily\n\ndefined \u201cprohibited personnel practices\u201d with the Office of Special Counsel, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1211-\n\n1219, et seq., which is statutorily charged with investigating such complaints and which may in\n\nturn pursue administrative relief before the MSPB.3 Second, under OPM regulations, a removed\n\nprobationer may appeal to the MSPB if they allege that the removal was based upon one of the\n\nreasons set forth in the regulations. See id. \u00a7 315.806.\n\n\n2\n  As noted supra, OPM regulations promulgated under the CSRA provide that agencies are to use\nthe probationary or trial period \u201cas fully as possible to determine the fitness of the employee and\nshall terminate his or her services during this period if the employee fails to demonstrate fully his\nor her qualifications for continued employment.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.803(a). When an agency decides\nto terminate an employee covered by these regulations because his or her work performance or\nconduct during the probationary or trial period fails to demonstrate fitness or qualifications for\ncontinued employment, it must notify the employee and provide \u201cthe agency\u2019s conclusions as to\nthe inadequacies of his [or her] performance or conduct.\u201d Id. \u00a7 315.804(a).\n3\n  Congress also created the Office of Special Counsel to, among other things, protect employees,\napplicants for employment, and former employees. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1212. The Special Counsel may\nreceive and investigate complaints of prohibited personnel practices and may petition the MSPB\nfor a stay of the personnel actions pending investigation, and based on the results of an\ninvestigation, seek corrective action from the Board. Id. \u00a7 1214.\n                                                  4\n\f   II.      Factual Background\n\n         A. OPM\u2019s January 20 Guidance Memorandum on Probationary Periods and\n            Revised March 4 Guidance Memorandum\n\n         President Trump campaigned on a promise to raise standards for federal government\n\nemployment and improve the Civil Service workforce. On his first day in office, President Trump\n\nsigned a memorandum declaring that \u201cAmerican citizens deserve an excellent and efficient Federal\n\nworkforce that attracts the highest caliber of civil servants committed to achieving the freedom,\n\nprosperity, and democratic rule that our Constitution promotes.\u201d Reforming the Federal Hiring\n\nProcess and Restoring Merit to Government Service (Jan. 20, 2025). Consistent with the new\n\nadministration\u2019s focus on federal employee performance, OPM Acting Director Charles Ezell\n\ntransmitted a guidance memo to Executive Branch agencies identifying probationary periods as\n\n\u201can essential tool for agencies to assess employee performance.\u201d Mem. from Charles Ezell, Acting\n\nDirector, U.S. Office of Personnel Management, to Heads and Acting Heads of Departments and\n\nAgencies, titled \u201cGuidance on Probationary Periods, Administrative Leave and Details,\u201d at 1 (Jan.\n\n20, 2025) (\u201cOPM Mem.\u201d). The memo directed agencies to \u201cidentify all employees on probationary\n\nperiods, who have served less than a year in a competitive service appointment, or who have served\n\nless than two years in an excepted service appointment, and send a report to OPM listing all such\n\nemployees[.]\u201d Further, the OPM Memorandum directed agencies to \u201cpromptly determine whether\n\nthose employees should be retained at the agency.\u201d OPM Mem. at 1.\n\n         Following a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California and\n\nthe resulting entry of a limited temporary restraining order governing OPM\u2019s guidance to federal\n\nagencies regarding probationary removals, OPM issued revised guidance on March 4. In relevant\n\npart, the revised OPM guidance clarified and emphasized that \u201cOPM is not directing agencies to\n\ntake any specific performance-based actions regarding probationers. Agencies have ultimate\n                                                 5\n\fdecision-making authority over, and responsibility for, such personnel actions.\u201d Revised Mem.\n\nfrom Charlies Ezell, Acting Director, U.S. Office of Personnel Management, to Heads and Acting\n\nHeads of Departments, titled \u201cGuidance on Probationary Periods, Administrative Leave and\n\nDetails,\u201d at 2 (Revised: March 4, 2025) (\u201cRev. OPM Mem.\u201d).\n\n       B. Executive Order 14,210\n\n       On February 11, 2025, President Trump signed Executive Order 14,210, which\n\n\u201ccommences a critical transformation of the Federal bureaucracy\u201d to \u201crestore accountability to the\n\nAmerican public\u201d by \u201celiminating waste, bloat and insularity.\u201d Implementing the President\u2019s\n\n\u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency\u201d Workforce Optimization Initiative, Exec. Order. No.\n\n14,210, \u00a7 1, 90 Fed. Reg. 9669 (Feb. 11, 2025) (\u201cWorkforce E.O.\u201d). The Workforce E.O. directed\n\nthe Director of the Office of Management and Budget (\u201cOMB\u201d) to \u201csubmit a plan to reduce the\n\nsize of the Federal Government\u2019s workforce through efficiency improvements and attrition.\u201d Id.\n\n\u00a7 3. It further required that new career appointment hiring decisions shall be made \u201cin consultation\n\nwith the agency\u2019s DOGE Team Lead, consistent with applicable law,\u201d and that the agency shall\n\nnot fill vacancies for career appointments that the DOGE Team Lead assesses should not be filled,\n\n\u201cunless the Agency Head determines the positions should be filled.\u201d Id. \u00a7 3(b)(i)\u2013(ii).\n\n       The Workforce E.O. directed agency heads to \u201cpromptly undertake preparations to initiate\n\nlarge-scale reductions in force (RIFs), consistent with applicable law, and to separate from Federal\n\nservice temporary employees and reemployed annuitants working in areas that will likely be\n\nsubject to the RIFs.\u201d Id. \u00a7 3(c). The Workforce E.O. also directed the Director of OPM to initiate\n\na rulemaking by March 11, 2025 that proposes to revise 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 731.202(b) to include additional\n\nsuitability criteria. Id. \u00a7 3(e). In addition, by March 11, 2025, agency heads must submit to the\n\nDirector of OMB a report that identifies any statutes that establish the agency, or subcomponents\n\n\n                                                 6\n\fof the agency, as statutorily required entities, and discuss whether the agency or any of its\n\nsubcomponents should be eliminated or consolidated. Id. Pursuant to the Workforce E.O., the\n\nUSDS Administrator must submit a report to the President within 240 days of the date of the E.O.\n\n\u201cregarding implementation of this order, including a recommendation as to whether any of its\n\nprovisions should be extended, modified or terminated.\u201d Id. \u00a7 3(f).\n\n       C. Agency Terminations of Certain Probationers; District Court Challenges and\n          Stay Proceedings Before the MSPB\n\n       Certain federal agencies have terminated probationers. See, e.g., Mem. Op. & Order at 3,\n\nNTEU v. Trump, No. 25-cv-420 (CRC), (\u201cNTEU v. Trump\u201d), ECF No. 28 (noting the termination\n\nof certain probationers working at federal agencies). Legal challenges in district court followed.\n\nIn NTEU v. Trump, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia denied a motion for\n\ntemporary restraining order and preliminary injunction on February 20, holding that the union\n\nplaintiffs\u2019 claims fell outside of district court jurisdiction under the FSL-MRS and the CSRA.\n\nNTEU v. Trump, 2025 WL 561080 (Feb. 20, 2025) at *1.\n\n       And in American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) v. Ezell, et al., No. C 25-\n\n01780 WHA (N.D. Cal), the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California issued a\n\nnarrow temporary restraining order on March 4 enjoining OPM from taking any action\n\ncharacterized as \u201cordering\u201d federal agencies to terminate their probationers. Id. at 24.4 (OPM\n\nmaintains that it has never issued any such order, and litigation remains ongoing.) The court, like\n\nthe court in NTEU v. Trump, held that the union plaintiffs\u2019 claims fell outside of its jurisdiction\n\nunder the FSL-MRS and the CSRA. Id. at 11. It concluded, on the basis of the TRO record and\n\n\n\n4\n   A copy of the North District of California district court transcript in AFGE is attached for the\nCourt\u2019s convenience, as it does not appear to be not available on Westlaw at this time. (Attached\nas Ex. 1).\n                                                7\n\fbriefing before it, that it could assert limited jurisdiction over certain claims brought against OPM\n\nby non-union, non-employee organizational plaintiffs. Id. at 21-22. As the States note, OPM has\n\nissued revised guidance, though they are mistaken that the AFGE court required it. See Id. at 24\n\n(requiring OPM to notify NPS, BLM, VA, DOD, SBA, and NSF [sic NWS] that any efforts to\n\ndirect the termination of employees \u201care illegal\u201d). At the same time, the court disclaimed any\n\npower to rescind terminations taken by agencies of their own force; the court understood its role\n\nas only enjoining OPM from directing such terminations, and ensuring that the agencies\n\nappreciated the scope of their own decision-making authority.\n\n       On a parallel track, removed probationers have pursued relief before the Office of Special\n\nCounsel. On February 21, 2025, the Special Counsel requested a stay of the termination of six\n\nprobationers. See Special Counsel\u2019s Initial Request for Stay or Personnel Action, Special Counsel\n\nex rel. Doe v. OPM, No. CB-1208-25-17-U-1 (MSPB). On February 25, 2025, the MSPB granted\n\nthat request. See Non-Precedential Stay Order, Special Counsel ex rel. Doe v. OPM, No. CB-1208-\n\n25-17-U-1 (MSPB). And as recently as March 5, 2025, on a February 28 stay request submitted\n\nby the Special Counsel on behalf of a J. Doe complainant, the MSPB Chair stayed the removal of\n\nseveral thousand USDA probationers, ordering that \u201cMr. Doe shall be placed in the position that\n\nhe held prior to the probationary termination. Likewise, all other probationary employees whom\n\nthe agency has terminated since February 13, 2025, pursuant to letters stating, \u2018The [a]gency finds,\n\nbased on your performance, that you have not demonstrated that your further employment at the\n\n[a]gency would be in the public interest,\u2019 shall be placed in the positions that they held prior to the\n\nprobationary terminations[.]\u201d See Non-Precedential Stay Order, Special Counsel ex rel. Doe v.\n\nDep\u2019t of Agriculture, No. CB-1208-25-0020-U-1 (MSPB).\n\n\n\n\n                                                  8\n\f                          THE STATES\u2019 CLAIMS IN THIS ACTION\n\n        The States base their motion for a TRO on claims under the Administrative Procedure Act\n\n(\u201cAPA\u201d) and a claim alleging ultra vires action. They seek an order providing three forms of\n\ntemporary relief, all explicitly personnel-related:\n\n        \u2022   \u201cTemporarily restraining Defendants from terminating federal probationary employees\n            without making specific, individualized determinations regarding the inadequacy of the\n            employee\u2019s conduct or performance;\u201d\n\n        \u2022   \u201cCompelling Defendants to reinstate federal probationary employees fired on or after\n            January 20, 2025, as part of mass terminations that did not comply with RIF procedures\n            and were not based on individual determinations of conduct or performance;\u201d and\n\n        \u2022   \u201cRequiring Defendants to file a status report with the Court within 48 hours, and at\n            regular intervals thereafter, identifying under seal all probationary employees\n            terminated on or after January 20, 2025 . . . and describing all steps Defendants have\n            taken to comply with the Court\u2019s Order.\u201d\n\nStates\u2019 Br. at 2.\n\n                                    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n        \u201cA [TRO or] preliminary injunction is \u2018an extraordinary remedy that may only be awarded\n\nupon a clear showing that the plaintiff is entitled to such relief\u2019 and may never be awarded \u2018as of\n\nright.\u2019\u201d Mountain Valley Pipeline, LLC v.

Dep\u2019t of Def., 947\n\nF.3d 207, 219 (4th Cir. 2020), as amended (Jan. 14, 2020) (citation omitted).\n\n                                            ARGUMENT\n\n        The States cannot make the \u201cclear showing\u201d of entitlement to a TRO required for that\n\nextraordinary relief. Most obviously, they cannot establish a likelihood of success on the merits\n\n                                                   9\n\fbecause they cannot show standing to sue; the claims they assert are jurisdictionally channeled\n\naway from federal district courts under the CSRA; and they have not identified any unlawful\n\nterminations regardless. Further, they have not shown irreparable harm absent temporary relief.\n\nFinally, the balance of equities and the public interest strongly favor Defendants.\n\n        I.      The States Have Not Shown Likelihood of Success on the Merits Because They\n                Cannot Establish Jurisdiction over their Claims.\n\n        To establish likelihood of success on the merits of their claims, the States must show, at\n\nminimum, that they have Article III standing, and that their claims otherwise would fall within the\n\nCourt\u2019s subject-matter jurisdiction. They cannot make either showing here: they lack standing,\n\nand their asserted claims would be jurisdictionally channeled away from district court review in\n\nany event under the comprehensive scheme governing federal employment disputes. They also\n\nfail to show that Defendants acted inconsistent with law.\n\n        A.      The States Cannot Show Standing.\n\n        To invoke the jurisdiction of this Court, the States \u201cmust show\u201d that they have \u201csuffered,\n\nor will suffer, an injury that is \u2018concrete, particularized, and actual or imminent; fairly traceable to\n\nthe challenged action; and redressable by a favorable ruling.\u2019\u201d Murthy v. Missouri, 603 U.S. 43,\n\n57 (2024) (quoting Clapper v. Amnesty Int\u2019l USA, 568 U.S. 398, 409 (2013)). The alleged injury-\n\nin-fact cannot be \u201cspeculative\u2014meaning that the injury must have already occurred or be likely to\n\noccur soon.\u201d FDA v. All. for Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. 367, 381 (2024). If the injury has not\n\nmaterialized, it must be \u201ccertainly impending,\u201d and \u201c[a]llegations of possible future injury are not\n\nsufficient.\u201d Clapper, 568 U.S. at 409 (citation omitted). In addition, \u201cstanding is not dispensed in\n\ngross,\u201d and \u201c\u2018plaintiffs must demonstrate standing for each claim they press\u2019 against each\n\ndefendant, \u2018and for each form of relief that they seek.\u2019\u201d Murthy, 603 U.S. at 61 (quoting\n\nTransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 594 U.S. 413, 431 (2021)).\n\n                                                  10\n\f       The States fail to satisfy these fundamental principles. They premise their standing\n\nassertion primarily on resource-diversion and financial-harm grounds, arguing that removals of\n\nprobationers will result in loss of tax revenue attributable to those employees\u2019 lost income (States\u2019\n\nBr. at 28); diversion of resources to assist such employees and provide unemployment benefits (id.\n\nat 24-25) (while conceding unemployment insurance benefits \u201care generally reimbursed by the\n\nfederal government\u201d for federal workers, id. at 25); and increased enrollments in state insurance\n\nprograms (id. at 27).5 Such indirect injuries are insufficient to create standing to sue. In United\n\nStates v. Texas, 599 U.S. 670, 674 (2023), states sued the federal government to challenge an\n\nimmigration policy that would \u201cimpose[] costs on the States.\u201d Id. The States claimed the policy\n\nwould force them to \u201csupply social services such as healthcare and education\u201d to persons it\n\notherwise would not. Id. The Supreme Court held the States lacked standing, explaining that\n\n\u201cfederal courts must remain mindful of bedrock Article III constraints in cases brought by States\n\nagainst an executive agency or officer.\u201d Id. at 680 n.3. \u201c[I]n our system of dual federal and state\n\nsovereignty, federal policies frequently generate indirect effects on state revenues or state\n\nspending.\u201d Id. \u201cAnd when a State asserts, for example, that a federal law has produced only those\n\nkinds of indirect effects, the State\u2019s claim for standing can become more attenuated.\u201d Id.\n\n       The absence of a concrete injury is highlighted by the extraordinary breadth of the States\u2019\n\nsuit. Plaintiffs admit that their suit treats the \u201ctermination of tens of thousands of employees\u201d as\n\n\u201cfinal agency actions subject to this Court\u2019s review.\u201d States\u2019 Br. at 16. And they seek to prevent\n\n\n\n5\n  The States\u2019 claim they are \u201cstruggling\u201d to provide unemployment insurance and other benefits\nfor terminated probationers warrants skepticism. States\u2019 Br. at 2. The States allege that\nDefendants have terminated about 24,000 probationers nationwide since January 20. By\ncomparison, more than 220,000 individuals made claims for unemployment insurance in just the\nweek ending March 1. Dep\u2019t of Labor, https://www.dol.gov/ui/data.pdf. And the States do not\nexplain what share of the 24,000 allegedly terminated probationers reside in their States, which\naccount for fewer than half of the States overall.\n                                                 11\n\falleged final agency actions that have not even happened yet in attempting to bar nearly every\n\ncabinet department and other agencies from terminating probationers in the future. Significantly,\n\nthey fail to connect nearly any of these past and potential future personnel actions to any of the 20\n\nState plaintiffs. They also offer little specificity with these thousands of purported agency actions.\n\nThe States provide the most detail on terminations made by the National Science Foundation,\n\nStates\u2019 Br. at 11, but that agency\u2019s terminations are not even part of this suit because the States\n\nchose to omit it as a defendant. The States\u2019 choice to sue 41 Executive Branch officials and\n\nagencies resembles Murthy, where two States and five individuals \u201csued dozens of Executive\n\nBranch officials and agencies.\u201d 603 U.S. at 54. The plaintiffs lacked standing to litigate that\n\n\u201csprawling suit,\u201d id. at 61, the Supreme Court again held, because of the absence of \u201cany concrete\n\nlink between their injuries and the defendants\u2019 conduct,\u201d id. at 76. Here too, \u201cstanding doctrine\n\nprevents [courts] from \u201cexercis[ing] such general legal oversight\u201d of the other branches of\n\nGovernment.\u201d Id.\n\n       And even if those conjectural assertions could suggest an injury-in-fact traceable to\n\nDefendants\u2019 actions, the States cannot satisfy standing\u2019s redressability prong. All of the States\u2019\n\nclaims derive from those of any removed probationers: the States\u2019 asserted injuries could only be\n\nconceivably redressed by their reinstatement. But reinstatement of removed probationers is a\n\nremedy overwhelmingly, if not exclusively, channeled away from federal district courts under the\n\nCSRA.6 Because the Court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction to award the only remedy that might\n\n\n\n\n6\n  Limited exceptions to the CSRA\u2019s comprehensive scope exist. For example, Title VII claims are\nheard in district court, consistent with the CSRA\u2019s exception for claims under that scheme. And\ncertain agencies are subject to different (and similarly preclusive) statutory administrative-judicial\nreview schemes, such as that applicable to Title 38 employees of the Veterans Health\nAdministration, part of the Department of Veterans Affairs. See 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 714.\n                                                 12\n\fredress the States\u2019 claimed harms here, the States cannot show redressability, and thus cannot\n\nestablish standing.\n\n        To flesh this out further, take the States\u2019 asserted loss of tax revenue (States\u2019 Br. at 28).\n\nAny injury attributable to future lost tax revenue attributable to probationer removals (or future\n\nprobationary removals) in 2025 is neither concrete nor certainly imminent at this point. But even\n\nif the States could surmount that injury-in-fact hurdle, they cannot show how a federal district\n\ncourt could award them any remedy that would redress such injury. The only remedy that might\n\nrestore potential lost tax revenue for any of these States would be reinstatement of the removed\n\nprobationers at issue, thereby restoring them (and their taxable incomes) to the States\u2019 tax bases.\n\nAnd under the CSRA, that remedy is unavailable under the facts asserted here.\n\n        As explained above, removals of covered federal employees must generally be appealed to\n\nthe MSPB, with judicial review available exclusively in the Federal Circuit. See Elgin, 567 U.S.\n\nat 5, 11-13. That administrative-judicial review pathway bypasses district court entirely, even for\n\nconstitutional claims (which the States have not asserted in any event). Id. The same rule holds\n\ntrue for probationers, who cannot appeal their removals to the MSPB as of right, but must instead\n\npursue relief through the Office of Special Counsel complaint process (which may result in review\n\nby the MSPB). The bottom line is the same: any administrative-judicial review pathway bypasses\n\ndistrict court entirely, meaning that district courts lack jurisdiction to review their claims under the\n\nCSRA. NTEU v. Trump, 2025 WL 561080, at *1. And lacking jurisdiction to review challenges\n\nto probationary employee removals, federal district courts likewise lack jurisdiction to issue the\n\nonly remedy that might redress the States\u2019 asserted loss of tax revenue.\n\n        The district court opinion in NTEU is particularly instructive here. The unions alleged that\n\na large-scale removal of probationers would reduce their membership numbers and revenues,\n\n\n\n                                                  13\n\fdivert their resources, and reduce their heft at the bargaining table. 2025 WL 561080 at *6.\n\nAssessing its jurisdiction over the unions\u2019 claims under the Thunder Basin doctrine, see Part I.B,\n\ninfra, the court concluded that jurisdiction over those claims was channeled exclusively through\n\nthe Federal Labor Relations Authority (\u201cFLRA\u201d), and from there to a court of appeals, under the\n\nspecial review scheme established by the FSL-MRS. Id. at **6-7. In particular, the court\n\nobserved, \u201c[if] the FLRA finds an unfair labor practice, for instance, it may \u2018require reinstatement\n\nof an employee with backpay\u2019\u201d under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7118(a)(7)(C). Id. at *7. And having determined\n\nboth that the unions could pursue their claims through the FLRA, id., and that individual\n\nemployees with appeal status could pursue similar recourse before the MSPB, id. at n.2, the court\n\nconcluded that the jurisdictional scheme is exclusive, thus foreclosing district court review. Id. at\n\n**5-8. What that means for the States\u2019 standing assertion is this: lacking jurisdiction to even\n\nconsider (much less remedy) the claims of removed employees, district courts cannot redress the\n\nStates\u2019 asserted injuries-in-fact, thus depriving them of Article III standing.\n\n       Not does it matter that the States seek to assert claims under the APA: courts have\n\nuniformly held that the CSRA precludes claims under the APA. See Hall v. Clinton, 235 F.3d 202,\n\n206 (4th Cir. 2000); Bolton v. Colvin, 674 Fed. Appx. 282, 290\u201391 (4th Cir. 2017); Mann v. Haigh,\n\n120 F.3d 34, 38 (4th Cir. 1997). The comprehensive preclusion of APA review (and remedies) for\n\nthose most directly affected by the employment-based actions here, federal employees themselves,\n\nis no less comprehensive for parties that are affected by those actions (if at all) in a derivative,\n\nattenuated, and downstream way.\n\n       The same outcome holds true for the States\u2019 other asserted injuries: diversion of assistance\n\nresources (States\u2019 Br. at 2, 13) and increased enrollment in state-administered insurance programs\n\n(id. at 27). Here too, the existence of an injury-in-fact is speculative, attenuated, downstream, and\n\n\n\n                                                 14\n\funproven. But setting that aside, neither of these alleged injuries would be redressable by any\n\nrelief within the Court\u2019s power to award. To prevent or stem the diversion of state assistance\n\nresources, the Court again would have to order reinstatement of the removed probationers into\n\ntheir former agency jobs. And to reduce enrollment in state-administered insurance programs back\n\nto their baseline levels, the Court would have to enter the same relief. As explained above, that\n\nsort of remedy falls outside of district court jurisdiction under the CSRA.\n\n       Finally, the States claim they are entitled to specific, advance notice of every probationary\n\nemployee that each federal agency has removed since January 20 or intends to remove. (States\u2019\n\nBr. at 2, 17-18). They do not have standing to press that claim either. As explained below, the\n\nStates\u2019 claim is without merit; it rests on a misunderstanding of both the facts and the applicable\n\nstatutory and regulatory provisions. But, regardless, \u201cnotice\u201d would not redress the States\u2019 claimed\n\ninjuries-in-fact, which again amount to asserted loss of tax revenue, diversion of resources, and\n\nincreased enrollment in state insurance programs. On this front, there is a basic mismatch between\n\nthe States\u2019 asserted injuries and their supposed right to relief.\n\n       B.      Jurisdiction over the Claims Asserted by the States is Channeled Away from\n               Federal District Courts under the CSRA and FSL-MRS.\n\n       Relatedly, the States cannot show that the claims they assert would fall within this Court\u2019s\n\njurisdiction given how comprehensively the CSRA and FSL-MRS govern employment-related\n\ndisputes between federal employees and agencies. Even though they cast their claims in terms of\n\ndirect injury, everything about their claims, and the remedies they seek, derives from the\n\nrelationship between the federal government and its employees, to which they are strangers. The\n\nStates cannot step into the shoes of those employees and assert claims against federal agencies that\n\nthe employees themselves cannot assert in federal district court, but must instead pursue before\n\nthe FLRA or the MSPB.\n\n                                                  15\n\f       And there is no question that these claims cannot be asserted in district court, by employees\n\nor anyone else. Under the familiar test for implied statutory preclusion under Thunder Basin v.\n\nCoal Co. v. Reich, 510 U.S. 200 (1994), a claim will be found to fall outside the scope of a special\n\nstatutory review scheme \u201conly in limited circumstances: when (1) a finding of preclusion might\n\nforeclose all meaningful judicial review; (2) the claim is wholly collateral to the statutory review\n\nprovisions; and (3) the claim is beyond the expertise of the agency.\u201d NTEU, 2005 WL 561080 at\n\n*5 (cleaned up). Since Thunder Basin, the Supreme Court and the D.C. Circuit have both held\n\nfederal employment or labor challenges to be exclusively channeled away from district court\n\nreview under both the CSRA and the FSL-MRS. See Elgin, 567 U.S. at 13 (CSRA review is\n\n\u201cexclusive, even for employees who bring constitutional challenges to federal statutes\u201d); Am.\n\nFed\u2019n of Gov\u2019t Emps. v. Trump, 929 F.3d 748, 752 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (\u201cAFGE v. Trump\u201d).\n\n       Again, the district court\u2019s recent decision in NTEU is especially instructive. The court\n\nthere held that the union plaintiffs could not sue in district court to challenge these very same\n\nactions, but must instead pursue relief through the FLRA. 2005 WL 561080 at **5-8. Further, in\n\naddressing the unions\u2019 argument that pursuing redress before the FLRA (and from there to a court\n\nof appeals) would be less efficient than doing so before a district court, the court emphasized that\n\nNTEU \u201cprovides no reason why it could not seek relief from the FLRA on behalf of a class of\n\nplaintiffs and admits that it would ask other agencies to follow an administrative judge\u2019s ruling in\n\nits favor.\u201d Id. at *7. In rejecting a challenge to OPM\u2019s \u201cFork in the Road\u201d deferred resignation\n\nprogram last month, the federal district court similarly held that the FSL-MRS precluded\n\njurisdiction. Am. Fed. of Gov\u2019t Emps., AFL-CIO v. Ezell, No. 25-cv-10276, 2025 WL 470459, at\n\n*2 (D. Mass. Feb. 12, 2025) (\u201cCongress intended for the FSL-MRS and [CSRA] . . . to provide\n\nthe exclusive procedures for disputes involving employees and their federal employer.\u201d).\n\n\n\n                                                16\n\f       The States make no mention of NTEU in their opening brief.7 Nor do they address Thunder\n\nBasin preclusion, or explain why their claims are not precluded by the comprehensive\n\nadministrative-judicial review schemes created by Congress in the CSRA and FSL-MRS. But any\n\nsuch argument would be unavailing for the same reasons already recognized by the court in NTEU.\n\n       Specifically, Congress has broadly empowered the judiciary to hear \u201cclaims \u2018arising under\u2019\n\nfederal law\u201d \u201cby way of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331\u2019s grant of jurisdiction.\u201d Axon, 598 U.S. at 185.\n\nNonetheless, \u201c[a] special statutory review scheme, . . . may preclude district courts from exercising\n\njurisdiction over challenges to federal agency action.\u201d Id. Where Congress has done so implicitly,\n\ncourts determine whether it intended to preclude particular claims by assessing whether \u201c(i) such\n\nintent is \u2018fairly discernible in the statutory scheme,\u2019 and (ii) the litigant\u2019s claims are \u2018of the type\n\nCongress intended to be reviewed within [the] statutory structure.\u2019\u201d Jarkesy v. SEC, 803 F.3d 9,\n\n15 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (quoting Thunder Basin, 510 U.S. at 207, 212).\n\n       The first step under Thunder Basin\u2014Congress\u2019s intent to preclude\u2014is plainly satisfied\n\nhere: Congress established a detailed statutory scheme for adjudicating federal employment and\n\nlabor disputes. The CSRA sets forth a process for covered employees to appeal removal decisions\n\nfirst to the MSPB, with judicial review available before the Federal Circuit following a final\n\ndecision from the MSPB. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(9). And probationers may similarly challenge their\n\nremovals through at least two pathways: via complaint to the Office of Special Counsel or, in more\n\nlimited instances, direct appeal to the MSPB. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(a)(2)(A)(i)\u2013(xii).\n\n\n\n\n7\n  Plaintiffs discuss the Northern District of California\u2019s decision in AFGE. But they do not\nacknowledge that the AFGE court rejected the union plaintiffs\u2019 claims as they were channeled\nexclusively through the FLRA; instead, the court rested its assertion of subject-matter jurisdiction\nsolely on the non-union, non-employee organizational plaintiffs. Defendants address that aspect\nof the district court\u2019s oral TRO ruling infra.\n                                                  17\n\f       Likewise, the FSL-MRS provides for \u201cadministrative and judicial review\u201d regarding\n\ndisputes between federal-employee unions and the federal government. AFGE, 929 F.3d at 752.\n\nCongress decided, through the FSL-MRS, that federal labor disputes must first be administratively\n\nexhausted before the FLRA. Judicial review, if any, is available only in a court of appeals. See id.\n\nat 752 (citing 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7105, 7123(a), (c)); see also 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(b) (judicial review in\n\nFederal Circuit or other court of appeals). \u201cCongress typically chooses . . . review in a court of\n\nappeals following the agency\u2019s own review process\u201d when designing an implicit preclusion\n\nscheme. Axon, 598 U.S. at 185. That is exactly what this scheme includes. Accordingly, as the\n\nD.C. Circuit has repeatedly recognized, the FSL-MRS precludes jurisdiction in the district courts\n\nover federal union disputes. See AFGE v. Trump, 929 F.3d at 754. This \u201cenormously complicated\n\nand subtle scheme to govern employee relations in the federal sector\u201d does not permit a district\n\ncourt runaround. See id. at 755 (quoting AFGE v. Sec\u2019y of the Air Force (\u201cAir Force\u201d), 716 F.3d\n\n633, 636 (D.C. Cir. 2013)).\n\n       Turning to the second Thunder Basin step\u2014whether particular claims are of the type\n\nCongress intended to be reviewed in this scheme\u2014the Court must consider \u201cthree considerations\n\ndesigned to aid in that inquiry, commonly known now as the Thunder Basin factors.\u201d Id. The\n\nfactors are: (1) \u201ccould precluding district court jurisdiction foreclose all meaningful judicial review\n\nof the claim\u201d; (2) \u201cis the claim wholly collateral to the statute\u2019s review provisions\u201d; and (3) \u201cis the\n\nclaim outside the agency\u2019s expertise?\u201d Id. (internal quotation marks, citation, and alteration\n\nomitted). These \u201cconsiderations\u201d are ultimately merely guideposts to \u201cbest [] understand what\n\nCongress has done\u2014whether the statutory review scheme, though exclusive where it applies,\n\nreaches the claim in question.\u201d Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  18\n\f       All three Thunder Basin factors are satisfied here. First, the CSRA and FSL-MRS schemes\n\nprovide for meaningful judicial review over the very claims asserted by the States, even if the\n\nStates themselves are not the proper parties to assert them. See AFGE, 929 F.3d at 755. Here, as\n\nin AFGE v. Trump, federal unions can challenge probationary removals or RIFs through the\n\nadministrative process \u201cin the context of concrete . . . disputes.\u201d Id. at 757; NTEU, 2025 WL\n\n561080 at *7. Similarly, if any affected party thinks that the probationary removals or RIFs\n\nconflict with any federal rule, guidance, or statute, it may assert that within the administrative\n\nscheme. See, e.g., Marshall v. HHS, 587 F.3d 1310, 1318 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (reversing based on an\n\nerroneous statutory interpretation); Lyons v. VA, 273 F. App\u2019x 929, 931 (Fed. Cir. 2008)\n\n(considering whether a regulation was violated); Fed. L. Enf\u2019t Officers Ass\u2019n v. Ahuja (\u201cFLEOA\u201d),\n\n62 F.4th 551, 560 (D.C. Cir. 2023) (noting challenges to OPM guidance through the MSPB\n\nsystem).\n\n       Second, the asserted claims are not wholly collateral. The Court must \u201cexamine whether\n\nthe action \u2018at bottom\u2019 seeks a substantive determination that falls within the statutory regime\u2019s\n\nexclusive scope.\u201d FLEOA, 62 F.4th at 563 (D.C. Cir. 2023) (quoting Heckler v. Ringer, 466 U.S.\n\n602, 615 (1984)). As the Supreme Court recently explained, a claim may be sufficiently collateral\n\nwhen the \u201cclaims do not relate to the subject of the [administrative] actions.\u201d Axon, 598 U.S. at\n\n193. There, the Court noted that \u201cseparation-of-powers claims\u201d brought against the administrative\n\nagency were entirely unrelated to the \u201cauditing practices,\u201d and \u201cbusiness merger\u201d that constituted\n\nthe subject matter of the agency actions. See id. Nor were they related to the \u201cprocedural or\n\nevidentiary matters an agency often resolves on its way to a merits decision.\u201d Id. No such\n\nseparation exists here. Much like the union plaintiffs in NTEU, the States challenge certain\n\n\n\n\n                                               19\n\fprobationary removals and ongoing (and future) RIFs. But those are all the kinds of federal\n\npersonnel and labor issues that lie at the heart of the CSRA and the FSL-MRS.\n\n       Third, and for similar reasons, the MSPB and FLRA may bring respective expertise to bear\n\non many of the questions raised. Indeed, Elgin directly addresses the point in the CSRA context.\n\nAs the Court noted: \u201cpreliminary questions unique to the employment context\u201d include fact\n\nquestions about a \u201cresignation\u201d (there whether it \u201camounted to a constructive discharge\u201d) as well\n\nas \u201cstatutory or constitutional claims that the MSPB routinely considers.\u201d See Elgin, 567 U.S. at\n\n22\u201323. Even if some of the claims could move beyond the administrative expertise of the FLRA,\n\nthese \u201cthreshold questions\u201d may \u201calleviate [the other] concerns.\u201d See id.\n\n       Again, the States have said nothing so far about Thunder Basin, Elgin, AFGE v. Trump, or\n\nNTEU, or about why they can assert claims in district court substantively identical to those held to\n\nbe jurisdictionally precluded from district court review when asserted directly by federal\n\nemployees themselves or the unions that represent them. But it would be an odd result if claims\n\nthat cannot be raised in district court by the plaintiffs most directly affected by the challenged\n\nactions could be raised by States whose asserted injuries are entirely derivative of such plaintiffs.\n\nAnd to Defendants\u2019 knowledge, no court has countenanced the States\u2019 argument here.\n\n       The most the States might be able to say on this point\u2014and all they have said\u2014is that the\n\ndistrict court in AFGE v. Ezell issued a limited TRO against OPM on the basis of similar claims\n\nasserted by non-employee organizational plaintiffs. But that does not help the States here. The\n\nStates acknowledge that since AFGE, OPM has clarified that the agency \u201cis not directing agencies\n\nto take any specific performance-based actions regarding probationary employees.\u201d States\u2019 Br. at\n\n12. And the AFGE suit relied on an altogether different theory of relief. There, the plaintiffs sued\n\n\n\n\n                                                 20\n\fOPM and its agency head alone. They did not attempt to seek APA review of tens of thousands\n\nof alleged final agency actions involving 41 federal government defendants.\n\n       C.      The States Have Not Shown that Defendants Acted Contrary to Law.\n\n       Even if the States\u2019 suit were procedurally proper, they have established that Defendants\n\ntook action inconsistent with law. The States fundamentally misunderstand Defendants\u2019 discretion\n\nto terminate probationers. \u201cCongress . . . saw summary terminations as essential to an effective\n\nand efficient service, and it has repeatedly acted to preserve agencies\u2019 discretion summarily to\n\nremove probationary employees.\u201d U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice v. Fed. Labor Relations Authority, 709\n\nF.2d 724, 730 (D.C. Cir. 1983). And \u201c[i]t has, throughout this time, delegated the task of defining\n\nand administering the specific probationary term to the President and other officials within the\n\nExecutive Branch.\u201d Id. \u201c[S]econd-guessing of the agency\u2019s decision . . . undermines the scheme\n\nCongress envisioned . . . .\u201d Id. at 289-90.\n\n       President Trump campaigned on a promise to improve the federal government workforce.\n\nThe recent increase in the number of terminations of probationers is consistent with his\n\nadministration\u2019s pledge to raise standards for federal employment. The States have not cited\n\nanything requiring a newly elected president to have his administration measure probationers by\n\nstandards set under a previous government. Proposals for heightened standards for probationers\n\nhave long circulated among federal workforce policymakers. During the Bush Administration, for\n\nexample, the MSPB advocated for greater scrutiny of probationers. MSPB, \u201cThe Probationary\n\nPeriod: A Critical Assessment Opportunity\u201d (Aug. 2005).8\n\n\n\n\n8\n https://www.mspb.gov/studies/studies/The_Probationary_Period_A_Critical_Assessment_Oppo\nrtunity_224555.pdf.\n                                                21\n\f       The States also fail to explain why an agency could not consider its needs and goals in\n\ndetermining whether it will make a probationer an employee.               The agency must use the\n\nprobationary period \u201cto determine the fitness of the employee.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.803(a). At the\n\nsame time, the probationer must \u201cdemonstrate fully his or her qualifications for continued\n\nemployment.\u201d Any fitness inquiry necessarily requires some consideration of the role that the\n\nprobationer is seeking. An agency\u2019s needs and goals for specific roles can change during a\n\nprobationary period\u2014especially during any intervening change in leadership. To the extent\n\nDefendants considered their needs in terminating probationers, that was permissible.\n\n       The States also wrongly suggest that Defendants issued defective notices to terminated\n\nprobationers. An OPM regulation obligates agencies to tell a terminated probationer \u201cwhy he is\n\nbeing separated.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.804(a). The States suggest this requires a \u201cparticularized\n\nassessment of performance or conduct.\u201d States\u2019 Br. at 18. But no statute or regulation requires\n\nthat. Instead, the regulation clarifies that an agency satisfies its notice obligation by stating its\n\ntermination conclusion: \u201cThe information in the notice as to why the employee is being terminated\n\nshall, at a minimum, consist of the agency\u2019s conclusions as to the inadequacies of his performance\n\nor conduct.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.804(a). A statement that a probationer has been terminated because\n\nof his or her performance during the probationary period is sufficient.\n\n       Finally, the States cast doubt on Defendants\u2019 terminations of probationers by calling them\n\nreductions in force (RIFs). Based on that same premise, the States argue that Defendants violated\n\nrequirements that agencies undertaking certain RIF proceedings must timely notify states or state\n\nentities designated to carry out rapid response activities under the Workforce Investment Act of\n\n1998. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d)(3)(A)(i); 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.803. But the premise is mistaken; the States\n\nignore fundamental differences between a RIF and the termination of a probationer. The actions\n\n\n\n                                                 22\n\fthey challenge here are the latter, not the former. Separately, agencies have begun to implement\n\nthe President\u2019s directive to consider and undertake RIFs, but there is no allegation in the States\u2019\n\nbriefing that any agency has failed to comply with RIF requirements in connection with those\n\ndistinct actions. Importantly, RIFs and probationary terminations are different things. Agencies\n\ncannot replace employees terminated as part of a RIF; the position is eliminated. But a terminated\n\nprobationer can be replaced.\n\n       The States also imply that OPM\u2019s circulation of a template for the termination of\n\nprobationers converted those terminations into a RIF. Not so. If anything, that template shows\n\nthat OPM did not direct Defendants to implement a RIF. Consistent with the probationer\n\ntermination notice regulation, that template suggested as model language: \u201cThe Agency finds,\n\nbased on your performance, that you have not demonstrated that your further employment at the\n\nAgency would be in the public interest.\u201d See TRO Mot. at 10. That rationale belies the States\u2019\n\nmischaracterization of probationer terminations as a reduction in force.9\n\n       II.     The States Cannot Show Irreparable Harm.\n\n       The States assert irreparable harm based on an increased demand for services they already\n\nprovide. That does not suffice. The States have not asserted \u201can invasion of a legally protected\n\ninterest,\u201d Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992), that is, an injury \u201ctraditionally\n\nredressable in federal court,\u201d United States v. Texas, 599 U.S. 670, 676 (2023). The States do not\n\nclaim that the firings of probationers cause them direct injury by, for example, requiring them to\n\nact or refrain from acting, determining their federal funding, or depriving them of a legal right. Cf.\n\n\n\n9\n  The States also seek relief that goes beyond Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(b)\u2019s authority to\n\u201cissue a temporary restraining order.\u201d A \u201crestraint\u201d is a \u201c[p]rohibition of action; holding back.\u201d\nRestraint, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (12th ed. 2024). The States\u2019 request for an order reinstating\nthousands of probationers to their roles is the opposite, a mandatory injunction. See Northeast\nOhio Coal. for Homeless & Serv. Emps. v. Blackwell, 467 F.3d 999, 1006 (6th Cir. 2006).\n                                                 23\n\fBiden v. Nebraska, 143 S. Ct. 2355, 2366 (2023) (\u201cThe Secretary\u2019s plan will cut \u2026 revenues,\u201d\n\nwhich is \u201cnecessarily a direct injury.\u201d). Rather, they contend that the firings have the incidental\n\neffect of increasing the States\u2019 burden to provide services. States\u2019 Br. at 16-17. That is the same\n\ntheory advanced and rejected in Texas. Compare States\u2019 Br. at 12 with Texas, 599 U.S. at 674, 680\n\nn.3 (citing Massachusetts v. Laird, 400 U.S. 886 (1970); Florida v. Mellon, 273 U.S. 12, 16-18\n\n(1927)). Moreover, while the States focus on the number of probationers fired, the reality is that\n\nany firing of a federal employee will only \u201cimpose[] peripheral costs on a State.\u201d Arizona v. Biden,\n\n40 F.4th 375, 386 (6th Cir. 2022). If those downstream costs are sufficient to state a cognizable\n\ninjury, \u201cwhat limits on state standing remain?\u201d Id.\n\n       It cannot be that a federal employment action that increased\u2014or decreased\u2014a State\u2019s\n\nunemployment obligations and thus affected social-services spending or tax revenue could be\n\nchallenged in federal court. It would mean that Justice Douglas was correct in Laird and that a\n\nState can sue to enjoin military action if it would result in lost tax revenue or other indirect costs.\n\nSee 400 U.S. at 887-91 (Douglas, J., dissenting); see also id. at 886 (summarily rejecting suit to\n\nenjoin Vietnam War).\n\n       In short, just as the States lack standing, they also lack cognizable irreparable harm.\n\n       III.    The Public Interest Weighs Against Temporary Relief.\n\n       Turning to the third and fourth factors governing issuance of temporary injunctive relief,\n\nthe States cannot establish that the balance of equities and the public interest favor granting the\n\nextraordinary remedy of a TRO. These final two factors merge in cases where relief is sought\n\nfrom the government. Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009). A TRO would be especially\n\nharmful to Defendants because probationary periods are time limited. For probationers whose\n\nprobationary periods end during a TRO, Defendants may be unable to later exercise their authority\n\n\n\n                                                  24\n\fto determine that the probationer is not fit for federal employment. In addition, the States\u2019\n\nrequested TRO would interfere with the President\u2019s ability to manage, shape, and streamline the\n\nfederal workforce to more closely reflect policy preferences and the needs of the American public.\n\n       A temporary restraining order would also impose significant and unrecoverable costs on\n\nDefendants. The relief sought by the States would require the federal government to pay salaries\n\nand benefits for persons who it otherwise would not be obligated to pay. These expenses are likely\n\nunrecoverable from terminated probationers even if Defendants ultimately prevail in this action.\n\nDefendants thus request that any relief be accompanied by a bond under Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(c),\n\nwhich provides that \u201c[t]he court may issue a preliminary injunction or a temporary restraining\n\norder only if the movant gives security in an amount that the court considers proper to pay the\n\ncosts and damages sustained by any party found to have been wrongfully enjoined or restrained.\u201d\n\nA bond is appropriate here given that any preliminary relief would potentially mandate that the\n\nExecutive spend money that may not be recouped once distributed.10\n\n       IV.     Any Relief Should Preserve the Executive\u2019s Discretionary Authority.\n\n       To the extent the Court considers entering the States\u2019 proposed request for relief, any order\n\nshould be limited to mitigate (albeit not eliminate) the significant harms it would cause to the\n\nExecutive\u2019s abilities to exercise its lawful statutory authority and discretion. To that end,\n\nDefendants respectfully request that any preliminary relief clarify that it does not prohibit the\n\nPresident from reissuing a different directive and/or Executive Order or limit the defendant\n\n\n\n\n10\n   Indeed, the States seek relief that exceeds Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(b)\u2019s authority to\n\u201cissue a temporary restraining order.\u201d A \u201crestraint\u201d is a \u201c[p]rohibition of action; holding back.\u201d\nRestraint, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (12th ed. 2024). The States\u2019 request for an order reinstating\nthousands of probationers to their roles is the opposite: a mandatory injunction. See Ne. Ohio\nCoal. for Homeless & Serv. Emps. v. Blackwell, 467 F.3d 999, 1006 (6th Cir. 2006).\n                                                25\n\fagencies from taking actions pursuant to their legal authority to regulate in furtherance of this\n\nsubstantive policy priority.\n\n         Moreover, Defendants respectfully request that any preliminary relief be appropriately\n\nnarrowly tailored to preserve the Executive\u2019s authority to exercise its Article II authority over the\n\nExecutive Branch. That is the normal equitable remedy, and anything broader would constitute a\n\nsignificant intrusion on the separation of powers. Ancient Coin Collectors Guild v. U.S. Customs\n\n& Border Prot., Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., 698 F.3d 171, 179 (4th Cir. 2012) (under ultra vires\n\nreview standard, court \u201cmay not dictate how government goes about its business but [rules] only\n\n[on] whether a public entity has acted within the bounds of its authority or overstepped them\u201d\n\n(citation omitted)).\n\nV.       Any Injunctive Relief Should Be Stayed Pending Appeal.\n\n         Finally, to the extent the Court issues any injunctive relief, Defendants respectfully request\n\nthat such relief be stayed pending any appeal that is authorized by the Solicitor General, or at a\n\nminimum that such relief be administratively stayed for a period of seven days to allow the United\n\nStates to seek an emergency, expedited stay from the court of appeals if an appeal is authorized.\n\n                                               CONCLUSION\n\n         For these reasons, this Court should deny Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion for a Temporary Restraining\n\nOrder.\n\n                                                Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                                YAAKOV ROTH\n                                                Acting Assistant Attorney General\n                                                Civil Division\n\n                                                ERIC J.

I'm not sure what happened, but\n\n19   we all have technical issues right now.\n\n20        I'm assuming from Ms. Leyton's statement that you asked us\n\n21   to explain what we are asking for.\n\n22              THE COURT:    Yes.   Well, all right.         So let's hear what\n\n23   the Government has to say.\n\n24              MR. HELLAND:    Yes.    Thank you, Your Honor.\n\n25       In short, no final decision has yet been made whether to\n\n\n\n\n                                        Exhibit 1\n\f                                                                                   4\n       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB   Document 20-1      Filed 03/10/25   Page 5 of 28\n\n\n1    produce Mr.Ezell for the scheduled evidentiary hearing or to\n\n2    seek relief from the Court's order, which would be done well in\n\n3    advance of that upcoming hearing.\n\n4         So it is not, Your Honor, the case that we've represented\n\n5    we will not be producing Mr.Ezell, rather simply no decision\n\n6    has been made from that.\n\n7         As far as the timing goes, Your Honor, I do want to convey\n\n8    that the Government is willing to consent to let the TRO remain\n\n9    in place for two more weeks so that any issues related to\n\n10   scheduling or other logistical or legal issues concerning the\n\n11   upcoming hearing can be addressed.           But, in short, Your Honor,\n\n12   it's not true that we have represented to the plaintiffs that\n\n13   we won't be producing Mr. Ezell.\n\n14              THE COURT:   Well, when do you think you will make a\n\n15   decision?\n\n16              MR. HELLAND:    Your Honor, by Monday.         We would ask\n\n17   that by Monday we either confirm that we'll be producing\n\n18   Mr. Ezell and any other witnesses that plaintiffs have\n\n19   identified, or that we would move for any relief by that time\n\n20   as well.\n\n21              THE COURT:   Well, you will recall that when the\n\n22   subject of an evidentiary hearing first came up, because of the\n\n23   difference of Ezell versus the other declarations, I thought\n\n24   you were quite enthusiastic and expectant about the evidentiary\n\n25   hearing and him coming to testify -- testify.             So I am a little\n\n\n\n\n                                      Exhibit 1\n\f                                                                                    5\n       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB   Document 20-1     Filed 03/10/25   Page 6 of 28\n\n\n1    surprised by this turn of events.\n\n2         But here's the thing:      Is the issue that -- a burden on\n\n3    him to get on an airplane and come across the country?               Is that\n\n4    the issue?\n\n5             MR. HELLAND:      There -- Your Honor, at a very high\n\n6    level, there are multiple issues that we are actively\n\n7    considering.   I'm not authorized to take a position on any\n\n8    particular issue, but there's just a host of issues that we're\n\n9    working through related to the hearing.\n\n10            THE COURT:    Well, here is -- because time is short and\n\n11   this is Thursday.    Monday we will have burned up three or four\n\n12   more days.   I have thought about the problem, and if the\n\n13   problem is that he doesn't -- he's busy and doesn't want to\n\n14   take the time to come in person, then I suggest that the\n\n15   plaintiffs could come to Washington and take his deposition;\n\n16   two hours should be sufficient.          And that could, then, be --\n\n17   you could take your part of the deposition and they could take\n\n18   their part of the deposition.        And -- but the plaintiffs\n\n19   deserve two hours themselves, so -- plus whatever time you\n\n20   would use.\n\n21       So that would save him being on an airplane, coming to\n\n22   San Francisco.   And then we could use his deposition in lieu of\n\n23   the live testimony.    So I give that to you as an option.\n\n24       And I suppose that another option could be that he could\n\n25   appear remotely at the hearing and be examined by both sides\n\n\n\n\n                                      Exhibit 1\n\f                                                                                   6\n       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB   Document 20-1     Filed 03/10/25    Page 7 of 28\n\n\n1    from either his home or his office.          That would also save time.\n\n2    So those are -- those would be ways to reduce the burden of\n\n3    appearing at an evidentiary hearing.\n\n4        Now, you do need to remember this, though:                You yourself\n\n5    put forward his declaration.       In fact, it's the only\n\n6    declaration that the Government put forward and there is a\n\n7    serious fact issue.    And it is highly unusual for any party in\n\n8    litigation to try to get away with they get their say but no\n\n9    cross-examination.\n\n10       One possibility would be that his -- his declaration would\n\n11   be struck if he refuses to be examined under oath by the other\n\n12   side.   You just can't have it both ways.\n\n13       And I'm sure you understand what I'm saying.                This is not\n\n14   like discovery, where the other side wants to go take\n\n15   depositions of someone else who is not in -- this is someone\n\n16   you yourself advanced as a declarant; and that is an important\n\n17   thing for the Government to keep in mind.\n\n18       Okay.     Monday -- what time on Monday will you let us know\n\n19   your position?\n\n20            MR. HELLAND:      We would ask for 5:00 p.m. Pacific,\n\n21   Your Honor.\n\n22            MS. LEONARD:      Your Honor, if I may be heard on the\n\n23   timing of this?\n\n24            THE COURT:    Yes.   Go ahead.\n\n25            MS. LEONARD:      We would ask that the Government be --\n\n\n\n\n                                      Exhibit 1\n\f                                                                                  7\n       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB   Document 20-1     Filed 03/10/25   Page 8 of 28\n\n\n1    inform of us of its position today.          They've had since last\n\n2    Thursday, and what we're talking about is the Government's\n\n3    decision to defy this Court's order that you entered last\n\n4    Thursday.\n\n5           It is -- the issues that they are raising are not issues\n\n6    regarding inconvenience.     They are considering whether to\n\n7    appeal Your Honor's order.      And they've had that order since\n\n8    last Thursday.    Mr. Helland did not raise any objection at the\n\n9    hearing at all.   So this is by way, I suppose, of\n\n10   reconsideration without even know knowing what these issues\n\n11   are.\n\n12          We are here today because time is of the essence, and with\n\n13   respect to Mr. Helland and his clients, we need to know whether\n\n14   we are going to be able to examine this witness or if the\n\n15   declaration is going to be struck or what the result of this\n\n16   is.    There's no reason -- absolutely no reason why the\n\n17   Government cannot make a decision on its position with respect\n\n18   to Mr. Ezell, and whether it is going to comply with this\n\n19   Court's lawful order.\n\n20             THE COURT:   Wait.    I thought they -- the TRO they did\n\n21   comply with that.\n\n22             MR. HELLAND:     Yes, Your Honor.\n\n23             THE COURT:   Isn't is that what -- so what order are\n\n24   they not complying with?\n\n25             MS. LEONARD:     The order to produce to Mr. Ezell at the\n\n\n\n\n                                      Exhibit 1\n\f                                                                                   8\n       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB   Document 20-1      Filed 03/10/25   Page 9 of 28\n\n\n1    upcoming hearing.    You ordered that on the record at the TRO\n\n2    hearing, and they are considering not complying.\n\n3               THE COURT:   Look -- go ahead.\n\n4               MR. HELLAND:    If I may, Your Honor.         I don't mean to\n\n5    speak over you but --\n\n6               THE COURT:   Please, go ahead.\n\n7               MR. HELLAND:    As we've made clear at this hearing and,\n\n8    I think, to plaintiffs' counsel previously, we are not\n\n9    contemplating simply ignoring Your Honor's order or not\n\n10   complying with it; we will either comply or we will seek relief\n\n11   from it in advance of the hearing.           I want to be very clear\n\n12   about that.\n\n13       As far as the timing goes, Your Honor, as I've already\n\n14   said we would -- the Government would be willing to extend the\n\n15   TRO for two more weeks to give more time for these issues to --\n\n16   to play out.\n\n17              THE COURT:   What's wrong with giving them that time?\n\n18       They're willing to extend the TRO.            I think the --\n\n19   you know, it is the Government; they have to consult with\n\n20   various arms of the government to decide what their strategy\n\n21   will be.   And they will give us the answer by 5:00 on Monday,\n\n22   and then if need be, we will extend the TRO by two weeks -- up\n\n23   to two weeks.   So -- yes.\n\n24              MS. LEONARD:    Apologies.\n\n25              THE COURT:   Go ahead.\n\n\n\n\n                                      Exhibit 1\n\f                                                                                    9\n       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB   Document 20-1      Filed 03/10/25   Page 10 of 28\n\n\n1              MS. LEONARD:     Apologies.        It's very hard to -- on the\n\n2    Zoom to know when to -- if I'm interrupting.              I apologize.\n\n3         Your Honor, the issue with that is the whole reason we're\n\n4    here is to ask for immediate injunctive relief to prevent the\n\n5    ongoing harm that has been caused by OPM's unlawful actions.\n\n6         Extending the TRO is certainly a minimum, if we're going\n\n7    to move the PI hearing.      But we are asking for further relief\n\n8    both with respect to other agencies and with respect to the\n\n9    actual relief ordered by the Court.\n\n10        At the TRO hearing, Your Honor, you -- and in your order,\n\n11   indicated that you didn't believe that reinstatement could be\n\n12   ordered based on the fact that the agencies were not joined.\n\n13   We have now, very quickly, moved to join the agencies that have\n\n14   received OPM's orders and have taken, themselves, unlawful\n\n15   action terminating these employees.\n\n16        The harm that is being caused is snowballing every day in\n\n17   the loss of services, and even a two-week extension will cause\n\n18   irreparable harm, Your Honor.        So we're prepared to move\n\n19   forward as quickly as possible.          These are simply delay tactics\n\n20   by the Government that has had your order since last Thursday.\n\n21   And they're -- they're not even offering a good-cause reason,\n\n22   Your Honor, for the -- for why they can't give you -- give you\n\n23   their position and why they need this extension.               Their only --\n\n24   their only reason is they haven't decided yet whether to\n\n25   appeal.\n\n\n\n\n                                      Exhibit 1\n\f                                                                                       10\n       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB     Document 20-1      Filed 03/10/25    Page 11 of 28\n\n\n1           And they -- the Government can make and its lawyers can\n\n2    make that decision very quickly, Your Honor, and they should\n\n3    have already decided that by now, frankly.\n\n4              THE COURT:       Well, listen, I'm a former member of the\n\n5    Solicitor General's Office, back when Jimmy Carter was\n\n6    president, and in order to appeal, they have to get the SG's\n\n7    approval.   So that's just one -- that's one step they've got to\n\n8    go through; but there are other arms of the Department of\n\n9    Justice and that -- they would -- and also the Office of\n\n10   Personnel Management.\n\n11          I don't think you're being -- I think you're exaggerating\n\n12   the need and not appreciating the Government's need to sort it\n\n13   out.   So I'm going to -- I disagree with you.\n\n14          The Government -- don't wait until 5:00 p.m., I'm going to\n\n15   give you until noon on Monday --\n\n16             MR. HELLAND:      Understood.\n\n17             THE COURT:       -- noon West Coast time on Monday.\n\n18          And by that point, you need to either -- if you're going\n\n19   to seek relief, that's when you have to do it.                   You can't just\n\n20   send a letter saying, \"We're going to do it.\"                You've got to\n\n21   file your motion.\n\n22          Do -- I think that's what you mean; right?\n\n23             MR. HELLAND:       Yes.\n\n24             THE COURT:       You'll seek relief on Monday.\n\n25             MR. HELLAND:       Yes, absolutely, Your Honor.             Yes.\n\n\n\n\n                                         Exhibit 1\n\f                                                                                     11\n       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB     Document 20-1     Filed 03/10/25   Page 12 of 28\n\n\n1              THE COURT:       Now, it could be -- let's just make sure\n\n2    we all understand.\n\n3         If you -- let's say that you were to object to the order\n\n4    to produce Ezell, and then go up on appeal.              The other part of\n\n5    the -- the rest of the evidentiary hearing could go forward.\n\n6    For example, plaintiffs, I believe from the hearing, are going\n\n7    to present witnesses who can tell us what was said in the\n\n8    telephone conference call that took place between the two --\n\n9    the January 20 and the February 14th; I think, it was on\n\n10   February 13.\n\n11        I expect that's what the plaintiffs will do.                That's what\n\n12   I had asked them to do because I would like to know what\n\n13   happened in that phone call.         That part could go forward even\n\n14   if -- even if Ezell does not testify.\n\n15        So I -- I'm -- right now, I'm inclined to keep the -- keep\n\n16   the hearing date even if Ezell does not testify.                But I will\n\n17   listen and read your papers.\n\n18        One other thing I want to say to the plaintiffs.                 When I\n\n19   said put -- you had permission to bring a motion to add\n\n20   agencies as parties, I was -- I didn't use the right phrase.\n\n21   But I was -- meant relief defendants.            In other words, they\n\n22   should only be parties to the limited extent necessary to give\n\n23   relief to something that OPM is found to have done wrong.\n\n24        But what -- there's no way that I'm going to allow you to\n\n25   bring in all these agencies and then, if other terminations\n\n\n\n\n                                        Exhibit 1\n\f                                                                                       12\n       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB     Document 20-1     Filed 03/10/25   Page 13 of 28\n\n\n1    occur that are independent of OPM, that the agency does on its\n\n2    own without -- without OPM's direction, then that's for another\n\n3    lawsuit.   That's not for Old Bill to deal with.                That has to be\n\n4    a brand-new lawsuit somewhere else.\n\n5         My case, this case is OPM, OPM, OPM, and Ezell, Ezell,\n\n6    Ezell, and the agencies only to the limited extent that they\n\n7    are necessary to be relief defendants.\n\n8         So I hope I'm making myself clear on that.                 It just cannot\n\n9    evolve into a gigantic lawsuit against all terminations.                  I\n\n10   am -- regardless of whether OPM is involved in the -- in the\n\n11   case.\n\n12        Do you understand what I'm saying?\n\n13              MS. LEONARD:     I do, Your Honor.        But one point of\n\n14   clarification if I may.\n\n15              THE COURT:      Sure.\n\n16              MS. LEONARD:     Because we have a certain number of\n\n17   terminations that have happened to date, and I understand and\n\n18   hear Your Honor and what you are saying about terminations that\n\n19   are coming down the line and might be happening from this\n\n20   moment forward.    But we have a certain number of terminations\n\n21   that have happened to date and our understanding of the\n\n22   Government's position is they are defending against the\n\n23   unlawfulness of those terminations in two different ways.                  They\n\n24   are saying the agencies did it already and that OPM -- that,\n\n25   you know, contrary to our evidence that OPM did it, and if they\n\n\n\n\n                                        Exhibit 1\n\f                                                                                        13\n       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB     Document 20-1        Filed 03/10/25   Page 14 of 28\n\n\n1    did it, it was lawful.\n\n2         So for the terminations that have happened to date, we --\n\n3    we had amended the complaint to -- to state a claim, Your\n\n4    Honor, even if they are right that the agencies did this to\n\n5    date, those are still unlawful terminations, Your Honor.\n\n6               THE COURT:      No, no.     If they're unlawful, those go to\n\n7    the Merit Systems Protection Board.\n\n8         That is kind of the classic case that -- where I would not\n\n9    have subject matter jurisdiction.                The -- so I am not agreeing\n\n10   with you on that.\n\n11        This case started out and should remain OPM-centric, and\n\n12   OPM has got to be the one who did something unlawful in order\n\n13   for you to get relief in this case.               It just can't be that\n\n14   we're going to bring in all these other agencies, even if --\n\n15   even if the agency did something independent, had nothing to do\n\n16   with OPM, and let's say that it was in violation of the Civil\n\n17   Service Reform Act, that's a clear case that goes to the Merit\n\n18   Systems Protection Board.\n\n19        So I am -- I'm not agreeing with you on that.\n\n20        All right.    But I just -- I felt like, when your motion\n\n21   came in, that -- this case is moving fast, so that's -- I'll\n\n22   rule formally on it in due course; but that is my major\n\n23   concern.\n\n24              MS. LEONARD:     Understood, Your Honor.\n\n25              THE COURT:      In terms of relief defendants -- relief\n\n\n\n\n                                          Exhibit 1\n\f                                                                                    14\n       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB   Document 20-1     Filed 03/10/25   Page 15 of 28\n\n\n1    defendants, no problem.      That is -- that is a legitimate\n\n2    addition.\n\n3         Okay.    Now, to come back, have we done all the damage we\n\n4    can do for now or can I -- do I need to stay on the line?\n\n5              MS. LEONARD:     Your Honor, we do have two more issues\n\n6    to raise with you today, here.\n\n7         And the first is with respect to -- we understand that\n\n8    we'll be getting the Government's position with respect to\n\n9    whether or not they're going to try to challenge and appeal\n\n10   your order with respect to Mr.Ezell.\n\n11        They have produced the list of the participants on the\n\n12   phone -- the February 13th phone call between OPM and the\n\n13   agencies.    We have identified four of the individuals on that\n\n14   list, as Your Honor ordered at the -- at the hearing last\n\n15   Thursday.    And the Government has also not confirmed that they\n\n16   will produce those individuals for the hearing.\n\n17        They are also not giving us an answer on that issue.                And\n\n18   we obviously need to know whether they're going to do that in\n\n19   order to be able to cross-examine them and get to the truth of\n\n20   what happened with respect to these OPM orders.\n\n21        So that is issue Number 1.\n\n22        There's a second issue, Your Honor.           The New York Times\n\n23   reported today that one of the individuals, the chief human\n\n24   capital officer of the IRS, that Your Honor cited in -- in the\n\n25   order after the plaintiffs put forward the evidence of that\n\n\n\n\n                                      Exhibit 1\n\f                                                                                       15\n       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB     Document 20-1       Filed 03/10/25   Page 16 of 28\n\n\n1    person's public statements regarding OPM's direction, was\n\n2    placed by the defendants on admin- -- was placed by its agency\n\n3    on administrative leave.        And it's very concerning, Your Honor,\n\n4    that that occurred after Your Honor's order identifying that\n\n5    evidence.\n\n6         We would like to subpoena that person to come testify at\n\n7    the PI hearing next week, Your Honor.              And we would like\n\n8    the Court's permission to do so.\n\n9         So there are two issues:            The four people from the list;\n\n10   and the IRS -- they call them \"chicos\" -- the IRS \"chico\" who\n\n11   the Government put on administrative leave after her statements\n\n12   were cited in Your Honor's order.\n\n13             MR. HELLAND:       May I briefly be heard on these?\n\n14             THE COURT:       Sure.\n\n15             MR. HELLAND:       So I had envisioned that the first point\n\n16   was already covered by Your Honor's order.                I think, Your Honor\n\n17   commented on it or at least a related point already.                   So I\n\n18   would just propose that our response to both of these points be\n\n19   presented by the same noon Monday deadline.                We can either\n\n20   include them in our papers or separately respond to plaintiffs\n\n21   directly on these points.          But we would just do so at that same\n\n22   time, Your Honor.\n\n23             THE COURT:       Well, before I agree to that, is it true\n\n24   that the IRS person was put on administrative leave?\n\n25             MR. HELLAND:      This is literally the first I'm hearing\n\n\n\n\n                                          Exhibit 1\n\f                                                                                      16\n       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB     Document 20-1      Filed 03/10/25   Page 17 of 28\n\n\n1    of it, Your Honor.      I had not heard that before plaintiffs'\n\n2    counsel mentioned it just now.\n\n3               MS. LEONARD:      We can represent to Your Honor that we\n\n4    believe it to be true.\n\n5               THE COURT:      Well, have you subpoenaed the people that\n\n6    you want?\n\n7         You should go ahead and subpoena them to appear at the\n\n8    hearing.    Don't wait for the Government to agree or not to\n\n9    agree.   You -- you're a big firm.             You have vast resources.\n\n10   You should go subpoena those people.\n\n11        But, in addition, I want the Government to tell me on\n\n12   Monday at noon that -- whether they're going to produce them\n\n13   voluntarily at the hearing or at a deposition or by -- remotely\n\n14   at -- at the evidentiary hearing.\n\n15              MR. HELLAND:      Yes, Your Honor.        Understood.\n\n16              THE COURT:      Do the plaintiffs have any other witnesses\n\n17   to that telephone call that are cooperative with you?\n\n18              MS. LEONARD:      So the list of -- we would need to\n\n19   subpoena individuals.\n\n20        So, Your Honor, we understood that your -- you ordered the\n\n21   Government already to produce up to four of the individuals on\n\n22   that list, so that's what we have asked them to do.                  Any other\n\n23   individuals who are current government employees we would need\n\n24   to subpoena.\n\n25              THE COURT:      I don't remember how I worded my order.\n\n\n\n\n                                        Exhibit 1\n\f                                                                                   17\n       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB   Document 20-1     Filed 03/10/25   Page 18 of 28\n\n\n1    So if I ordered it, okay, I'll stand by that.             I just don't\n\n2    remember now; and I can't say that you're reading what I said\n\n3    correctly.\n\n4         I would like to have those people at the hearing, and I\n\n5    would ask the Government to please cooperatively bring them.\n\n6    But if you're going to insist on a subpoena, then -- then I\n\n7    would at least ask you to accept service of the subpoena.\n\n8              MR. HELLAND:     I hear you, Your Honor; and we will set\n\n9    our response on all of this forward at -- on noon on Monday.\n\n10             MS. LEONARD:     So, Your Honor, you can see the problem\n\n11   with the timing that we have here, because we have had -- so\n\n12   the order was in the transcript of the hearing on -- on\n\n13   Thursday.    I think Your Honor was quite clear.\n\n14        And when we talked about that telephone call as to\n\n15   their -- their need to give us the list of individuals and then\n\n16   our ability to call up to four of them at the hearing, we have\n\n17   complied with that and we are quite concerned, again, that what\n\n18   we're hearing hear today is that the Government is shifting\n\n19   positions and is not -- is considering not making those\n\n20   individuals available in response to this Court's order.\n\n21        We would -- we would -- we -- we're concerned that if we\n\n22   wait until Monday to get their position, Your Honor, that with\n\n23   respect to both Mr. Ezell and, now, these four other witnesses,\n\n24   that it will be difficult to conduct any hearing on -- on\n\n25   Thursday if the Government is refusing to put forward any of\n\n\n\n\n                                      Exhibit 1\n\f                                                                                     18\n       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB     Document 20-1     Filed 03/10/25   Page 19 of 28\n\n\n1    the witnesses for that hearing.\n\n2         And -- and the timing, again, is being driven by what we\n\n3    see as an escalating harm every single day.              And we would like\n\n4    the opportunity to --\n\n5              THE COURT:       Is there any -- I mean, there were several\n\n6    agencies that I -- that -- for which you had standing and that\n\n7    I ordered OPM to rescind the memos.            And I -- from reading the\n\n8    press it seemed to me that that has been done.\n\n9         Is there an agency where they did not rescind and an\n\n10   agency is just going ahead and -- under some weird belief that\n\n11   OPM can direct them to terminate people?\n\n12        I don't think so.\n\n13             MS. LEONARD:       The Department of Defense, Your Honor.\n\n14   The Department of Defense has continued to terminate people\n\n15   using the template from OPM.         We can provide you with the\n\n16   proof.\n\n17             THE COURT:       Yes, but is it -- the template is one\n\n18   thing.   But is Department of Defense doing this under\n\n19   compulsion from OPM?\n\n20             MS. LEONARD:      We believe that they are.           And if it\n\n21   looks like a duck, walks like a duck, and quacks like a duck,\n\n22   just because you put a paper on it that says \"Oh, it's the\n\n23   agency's discretion\" -- which is what OPM did this week -- that\n\n24   doesn't mean it's not a duck, Your Honor.\n\n25        They are absolutely still acting under compulsion from OPM\n\n\n\n\n                                        Exhibit 1\n\f                                                                                     19\n       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB     Document 20-1     Filed 03/10/25   Page 20 of 28\n\n\n1    and all of the --\n\n2              THE COURT:       Oh, I don't know.       You're going to have to\n\n3    have proof of that.\n\n4           Which one of your plaintiffs has standing to sue the DOD?\n\n5              MR. HELLAND:       I believe the veterans' organizations.\n\n6              THE COURT:       No, I thought they were suing -- for the\n\n7    VA -- the Veterans Administration, I totally agree.                 But for\n\n8    Department of Defense --\n\n9              MS. LEONARD:       I believe, that was the basis of\n\n10   Your Honor's order last week, yes.\n\n11          And I would also say, Your Honor, if I may, that all of\n\n12   the terminations to date we will prove to Your Honor were done\n\n13   because of centralized instructions from OPM.               And the question\n\n14   in this case, absolutely, is:          How do we effectuate relief and\n\n15   stop the irreparable harm that those terminations are causing?\n\n16             THE COURT:       You should be -- you should be getting\n\n17   your evidence ready to prove that.             It's not just your say-so.\n\n18   I believe that you probably suspect that sincerely, but that's\n\n19   a strong statement that you just made, and you should come to\n\n20   the evidentiary hearing with some witnesses who can bear that\n\n21   out.\n\n22          And for the moment, though, the witnesses that are under\n\n23   the control of the Government, they have a legitimate -- I\n\n24   don't want to say \"right,\" but interest that I'm going to give\n\n25   them time to consider and talk with others in the government.\n\n\n\n\n                                        Exhibit 1\n\f                                                                                       20\n       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB     Document 20-1     Filed 03/10/25    Page 21 of 28\n\n\n1    So I'm not -- I'm sticking with noon on Monday for the\n\n2    Government to respond.\n\n3         And, yes, you will have to possibly move heaven and Earth\n\n4    on a short leash -- okay? -- timetable.\n\n5         While you're doing all that, I have a criminal trial\n\n6    starting on Monday.        I will have to interrupt the criminal\n\n7    trial to hear your case -- which I will do, but I -- you know,\n\n8    your case is not the only case that I have, and not the only\n\n9    case the Government has.        So I'm -- I'm sorry.            You're asking\n\n10   for too much and I'm denying -- I'm denying a more expedited\n\n11   schedule for the Government.         They --\n\n12             MS. LEONARD:       I understand --\n\n13             THE COURT:       They're going to go tell us and make their\n\n14   motion, if they're going to do it at all, Monday at noon.                   And\n\n15   today is Thursday and -- I'm sorry, but I think they need the\n\n16   time to do it.    That's the only -- it's fair.\n\n17        Now, with respect to the IRS person, that would be deeply\n\n18   disturbing if somebody was terminated for that reason.                  I'm not\n\n19   saying I have jurisdiction, even, over it, but it would greatly\n\n20   disturb me if compliance with my orders turns out to get people\n\n21   on administrative leave.\n\n22        So I'm going to order the Government attorney now to\n\n23   investigate this and report by tomorrow at noon by letter.\n\n24        You can do that.\n\n25             MR. HELLAND:       And, Your Honor, is that a letter that\n\n\n\n\n                                        Exhibit 1\n\f                                                                                     21\n       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB     Document 20-1     Filed 03/10/25   Page 22 of 28\n\n\n1    you want to --\n\n2               THE COURT:      To me -- to me and counsel to tell me --\n\n3    to tell me is it true --\n\n4               MR. HELLAND:      Thank you, Your Honor.\n\n5               THE COURT:      -- that they put him on administrative\n\n6    leave, and did this lawsuit have anything whatsoever to do with\n\n7    that administrative leave.\n\n8               MR. HELLAND:      Thank you, Your Honor.\n\n9         I just want to be clear.          This is not something that would\n\n10   be filed on a public docket, but will be submitted to Your\n\n11   Honor --\n\n12              THE COURT:      No, it will be on the public document.\n\n13              MR. HELLAND:     Oh, okay.\n\n14              THE COURT:      On the public docket.        Yes.\n\n15        You can do it by letter or by -- by formal noticed\n\n16   statement that would -- just a report to the Court on whether\n\n17   it's true and -- or if it's not fully true, to what extent is\n\n18   it true.\n\n19              MR. HELLAND:     Understood, Your Honor.\n\n20              THE COURT:      All right.      Now, does the plaintiff have\n\n21   anything more?\n\n22              MS. LEONARD:     With respect to the hearing next week --\n\n23   so I think we understand absolutely and we appreciate all the\n\n24   balancing of considerations and -- going into Your Honor's\n\n25   order; and we will wait for the Government's position.\n\n\n\n\n                                        Exhibit 1\n\f                                                                                       22\n       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB     Document 20-1     Filed 03/10/25    Page 23 of 28\n\n\n1         And if they agree to make the people available, there is\n\n2    no problem; we will be ready to go on Thursday, and we will\n\n3    confirm that.\n\n4         If they refuse to make the four individuals on the list\n\n5    who have the direct knowledge of the telephone call between OPM\n\n6    and the agencies -- which they have now admitted occurred, and\n\n7    if they refuse to make Mr. Ezell available, notwithstanding the\n\n8    declaration, should we submit our -- I'm asking what happens\n\n9    then, Your Honor, in terms of the Court's preferred procedures\n\n10   next.\n\n11        Because we will need to, I believe, discuss the\n\n12   implications for the evidentiary hearing and the PI,\n\n13   including -- so should we file a response to the Government's\n\n14   position by noon the next day?           What would your -- what would\n\n15   the Court prefer?\n\n16              THE COURT:      Yeah, that would be a good step to take.\n\n17        But my plan is to have the hearing no matter what.\n\n18   Even -- unless the Court of Appeals directs me not to have the\n\n19   hearing, we're going to have the hearing.\n\n20        And even if the Government witnesses don't show up, that\n\n21   could just result in striking the declaration.                  That would be a\n\n22   home run for you, the plaintiffs, because then the -- they\n\n23   would have no proof and the -- so I'm going to have the\n\n24   hearing.   I'm going to hold this hearing in person in\n\n25   San Francisco, and whoever's witnesses come, I'm going to\n\n\n\n\n                                        Exhibit 1\n\f                                                                                     23\n       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB     Document 20-1     Filed 03/10/25   Page 24 of 28\n\n\n1    listen to them.\n\n2         And we will also have argument over where we go next, and\n\n3    whether or not the TRO is merely extended or strengthened or\n\n4    whatever.\n\n5         But, you know, you have access, Plaintiffs, to witnesses,\n\n6    I'm sure, that are not beholden to the Government, and you\n\n7    ought to be thinking about bringing them to the hearing and\n\n8    presenting them live.\n\n9              MS. LEONARD:      Your Honor --\n\n10             THE COURT:       Give the other side notice of who they're\n\n11   going to be so they can prepare to cross-examine.                But you\n\n12   should be prepared to bring your witnesses.\n\n13        I'm sorry.    Go ahead.      I interrupted you.\n\n14             MS. LEONARD:       No, I interrupted you, Your Honor.            I\n\n15   apologize.\n\n16        Part of the problem here is that the Government has taken\n\n17   the actions that it has taken in secrecy, Your Honor.                 And the\n\n18   participants on the phone calls and Zoom meetings between OPM\n\n19   and the agencies are government employees.              And we are asking\n\n20   the Government, per Your Honor's orders, to make those people\n\n21   available.\n\n22        So it is difficult for us to provide Your Honor with\n\n23   witnesses with direct knowledge of the content.                 We certainly\n\n24   have circumstantial evidence -- but direct knowledge of content\n\n25   of those communications -- which is really at the heart of it\n\n\n\n\n                                        Exhibit 1\n\f                                                                                     24\n       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB     Document 20-1     Filed 03/10/25   Page 25 of 28\n\n\n1    and what Your Honor was seeking to hear the truth on -- without\n\n2    the Government making those individuals available.\n\n3               THE COURT:      Well, all right.      Yes.    I see your\n\n4    problem.\n\n5         And one thing you might be considering to do is a -- a\n\n6    prompt -- by \"prompt\" I mean within a few hours -- filing\n\n7    within the Court of Appeals to get your side of the equation\n\n8    before the Court of Appeals.         And -- so if that's where the\n\n9    issue is going to wind up, that's where -- listen here.\n\n10        I want to be very clear.          When I say the Government has a\n\n11   legitimate need to balance all these -- have their\n\n12   conversations, please do not misrepresent that to the Court of\n\n13   Appeals.   I in no way think that it would be proper for the\n\n14   Government to put forward Mr. Ezell as a witness and refuse to\n\n15   let him be cross-examined.        Zero.\n\n16        Do not say to the Court of Appeals that -- when I use the\n\n17   words \"a legitimate,\" I meant that you have a legitimate need\n\n18   to consult within the Government; but on the merits of what\n\n19   you're trying to, I totally disagree.            I think these people\n\n20   should be made available to be -- so that we can get at the\n\n21   truth of what happened here.\n\n22        So that's -- let's be very clear.             Don't misrepresent what\n\n23   I'm saying in this phone call on the merits that -- I stand by\n\n24   what I said earlier.       They should show up next Thursday until\n\n25   such time as I either change the order or the Court of Appeals\n\n\n\n\n                                        Exhibit 1\n\f                                                                                      25\n       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB     Document 20-1     Filed 03/10/25   Page 26 of 28\n\n\n1    makes me do so.\n\n2              MS. LEONARD:       Your Honor, in -- Your Honor had\n\n3    suggested earlier with respect to Mr. Ezell that we -- one of\n\n4    Government's alternatives, if there really is a scheduling\n\n5    issue, would be to make him available in D.C. for deposition.\n\n6         With respect to the other four individuals, the plaintiffs\n\n7    would be willing to go to D.C. and take their depositions early\n\n8    next week so that could be used at the -- at the preliminary\n\n9    injunction hearing as well.        Of course, we prefer --\n\n10             THE COURT:       That would be very much appreciated.            I\n\n11   think that might solve some of the logistics problems, if there\n\n12   are -- if it really is logistics.\n\n13             MS. LEONARD:       And we, of course, would prefer if the\n\n14   Government would make them available, as they have been ordered\n\n15   to do.\n\n16        But I wanted to make it very clear that the plaintiffs are\n\n17   very willing to do that and so if the objection is to bringing\n\n18   them here to this Court -- which, of course, this Court has\n\n19   venue and jurisdiction over this case and the ability to order\n\n20   their appearance.    But if that is the objection, that is not an\n\n21   objection that the Government should be raising.\n\n22             THE COURT:       Well, if they -- yes, that's fine.            Thank\n\n23   you for that.\n\n24        That could, in certain circumstances, solve the problem.\n\n25   It depends on what is motivating the Government, and the\n\n\n\n\n                                        Exhibit 1\n\f                                                                                       26\n       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB     Document 20-1       Filed 03/10/25   Page 27 of 28\n\n\n1    Government doesn't want to say yet.\n\n2         So all right.     Are we done?\n\n3              MR. HELLAND:      I believe so, Your Honor.\n\n4              MS. LEONARD:      I believe that is all from -- Your\n\n5    Honor, we understand that you have authorized us to subpoena\n\n6    the IRS CHCO who has --\n\n7              THE COURT:       Yes, please do.\n\n8              MS. LEONARD:      Thank you.\n\n9              THE COURT:       Please do.        And if the Government will\n\n10   not, by noon tomorrow, accept service, the Government attorney,\n\n11   then you have the Court's permission to track her down and\n\n12   serve her in person.\n\n13        Now, there is a thing called the Touhy regulations.                    I\n\n14   think it's T-O-U-H-Y.       So you better look into that.              Maybe\n\n15   that only applies to the DOJ, but you better look and see\n\n16   what -- if you have to go through some administrative hoops to\n\n17   subpoena a government employee.\n\n18             MS. LEONARD:      I appreciate that, Your Honor.\n\n19             THE COURT:       Okay.   Thank you all.         I look forward to\n\n20   seeing you next week.\n\n21             MR. HELLAND:      Thank you, Your Honor.\n\n22             MS. LEONARD:      Thank you very much, Your Honor.\n\n23             THE CLERK:       Court is adjourned.\n\n24                 (Proceedings adjourned at 1:44 p.m.)\n\n25                                      ---o0o---\n\n\n\n\n                                          Exhibit 1\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB   Document 20-1     Filed 03/10/25   Page 28 of 28\n\n\n1\n\n2                           CERTIFICATE OF REPORTER\n\n3              I certify that the foregoing is a correct transcript\n\n4    from the record of proceedings in the above-entitled matter.\n\n5\n\n6    DATE:   Friday, March 7, 2025\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n         _______________________________________________________\n11        Ruth Levine Ekhaus, RMR, RDR, FCRR, CCG, CSR No. 12219\n                  Official Reporter, U.S. District Court\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n\n\n\n                                      Exhibit 1\n\f",

Pursuant to the Court\u2019s March 7\n\n     Order inviting additional briefing from both parties, Plaintiffs submit this supplemental brief to\n\n     elaborate on three issues: (1) Plaintiffs\u2019 standing; (2) the reviewability of Plaintiffs\u2019 claims; and\n\n     (3) the necessity of the temporary relief Plaintiffs seek.\n\n\n                                                ARGUMENT\n\nI.          PLAINTIFFS HAVE STANDING TO BRING SUIT.\n\n             Standing requires, first, a concrete and particularized \u201cinjury in fact,\u201d namely, the\n\n     \u201cinvasion of a legally protected interest. Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992).\n\n     Second, the injury alleged must be \u201cfairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant[.]\u201d\n\n     Id. (cleaned up). Third, and finally, it must be \u201clikely\u201d that the harm will be \u201credressed by a\n\n     favorable decision.\u201d Id. Plaintiffs are suffering myriad distinct injuries that are directly traceable\n\n     to Defendants\u2019 unlawful actions and that would be redressed by the relief Plaintiffs seek. Plaintiffs\n\n     thus easily satisfy Article III standing requirements.\n\n            A.      Rapid Response Injuries.\n\n            Plaintiffs are harmed in their ability to conduct rapid response activities to support affected\n\n     workers because the Federal government has ignored its statutory obligation to provide notice to\n\n     the States. Both federal and state law require state personnel to carry out \u201crapid response activities\u201d\n\n     to assist dislocated workers in obtaining reemployment in the event of a \u201cmass layoff.\u201d 29 U.S.C.\n\n     \u00a7 2864(a)(2)(A)(i)(II); 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 3174(a)(2)(A)(i)(II); see also Pls.\u2019 Mot. at 7-8. In light of\n\n     Defendants\u2019 failure to provide notice of ongoing mass layoffs, Plaintiffs are also diverting or are\n\n     preparing to divert staff from critical state-funded matters, and are suffering administrative burdens\n\n     in the need to affirmatively contact federal agencies, monitor public reporting, and conduct mass\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 19        Filed 03/10/25      Page 3 of 19\n\n\n\noutreach to identify impacted workers. See Pls.\u2019 Mot. at 13; see also Republican Nat\u2019l Comm. v.\n\nN. Carolina State Bd. of Elections, 120 F.4th 390, 397 (4th Cir. 2024) (holding that plaintiffs\n\ndemonstrated injury where they were required to divert resources to respond to a legal violation);\n\nMayor & City Council of Baltimore v. Trump, 416 F. Supp. 3d 452, 490 (D. Md. 2019) (holding\n\nthat city demonstrated injury because it was \u201ccompelled to reallocate . . . finite resources\u201d); New\n\nEngland Anti-Vivisection Soc\u2019y v. Goldentyer, No. GJH-20-2004, 2021 WL 4459217, at *9 (D.\n\nMd. Sept. 29, 2021) (similar).\n\n       The strain on Plaintiffs\u2019 rapid response systems is directly traceable to Defendants\u2019\n\nunlawful RIFs, conducted without the required advance notice. The relief sought by Plaintiffs\n\nwould redress these injuries\u2014that is, reinstating affected probationary employees and requiring\n\nDefendants to comply with proper RIF procedures, including notice procedures, would alleviate\n\nthe need for Plaintiffs to scramble and devote significantly more resources to identifying and\n\nsupporting affected workers.\n\n       B.      Unemployment Benefits Administration Injuries.\n\n       Further contributing to Plaintiffs\u2019 injuries, many Plaintiffs are experiencing administrative\n\nburdens and costs due to the recent increases in federal unemployment claims. See, e.g.,\n\nWashington v. Trump, No. C25-0127-JCC, 2025 WL 415165, at *5 (W.D. Wash. Feb. 6, 2025)\n\n(Executive Order creating unrecoverable and \u201csubstantial administrative costs for state agencies\u201d\n\ncaused irreparable harm). Increased federal unemployment claims burden Plaintiffs by requiring\n\nthe processing of numerous additional claims. See, e.g., MD DOL Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 37-38, 73-74; see also\n\nPls.\u2019 Mot. at 12; 25-27 (identifying various burdens, including time-consuming investigations as\n\nto whether many terminated employees are eligible for benefits). Indeed, Plaintiff Maryland\n\nrepresents that, as of March 9, 2025, it has received 935 unemployment claims from federal\n\nworkers since January 21. Unfortunately, this is a substantial increase from the 813 claims\n\n\n                                                2\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 19       Filed 03/10/25      Page 4 of 19\n\n\n\nrecorded through March 4, as reflected in Maryland\u2019s DOL Declaration. MD DOL Decl. \u00b6 50,\n\nECF No. 4-5.\n\n       Defendants\u2019 unlawful RIFs have caused the ongoing wave of federal unemployment claims\n\nand, because Defendants conducted these RIFs without notice, affected employees did not receive\n\nstate services that could have quickly helped them to locate new employment, minimizing\n\nunemployment claims. Pls.\u2019 Mot. at 26. Further, because Defendants\u2019 employees were fired in a\n\npretextual and haphazard manner, Plaintiffs are now required to investigate numerous claims for\n\nunemployment benefits to determine if employees were in fact fired for cause, or for another reason\n\nthat would bar unemployment benefits. Id. Plaintiffs\u2019 sought relief, to reinstate affected\n\nprobationary workers and to cease improper mass terminations moving forward, would help\n\nredress the burden and cost to Plaintiffs\u2019 unemployment agencies.\n\n       C.      State Programmatic Injuries.\n\n       Defendants\u2019 abrupt terminations of federal workers have also harmed state programs that\n\ndepend on federal workers. Id. at 27. For example, some Plaintiffs\u2019 health departments rely on\n\nfederal civil service personnel recruited through the Center for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s\n\n(\u201cCDC\u201d) Public Health Associate Program (\u201cPHAP\u201d). Id. Defendants abruptly terminated\n\npersonnel pursuant to their unlawful mass layoffs, causing disruption to state health programs,\n\nincluding delays in communications with individuals exposed to communicable diseases. Here,\n\ntoo, an injunction requiring reinstatement of probationary employees and halting further unlawful\n\nand unnoticed layoffs will prevent ongoing injury to affected state programs and avoid further\n\nsimilar injuries moving forward.\n\n       D.      Injuries to State Finances.\n\n       Defendants\u2019 unlawful mass layoffs also continue to injure Plaintiffs\u2019 finances. As a result\n\nof the abrupt and unlawful terminations, many individuals will need to apply for and rely on state-\n\n\n                                                3\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 19        Filed 03/10/25     Page 5 of 19\n\n\n\nadministered and state-funded social service programs, such as health insurance programs. Many\n\nof the terminated federal workers will also suffer a reduction in income, causing a significant\n\ndecline in tax receipts. Pls. Mot. at 28-29; see also Washington v. Trump, 441 F. Supp. 3d 1101,\n\n1113 (W.D. Wash. 2020) (holding that \u201cthe loss of significant tax revenue\u201d is \u201csufficient to\n\nestablish Article III standing\u201d); North Dakota v. EPA, 127 F. Supp. 3d 1047, 1059 (D.N.D. 2015)\n\n(explaining that \u201clost tax revenue\u201d constitutes \u201cirreparable harm\u201d).\n\n       The fired probationary employees are unemployed solely because Defendants conducted\n\nunlawful RIFs. And again, because Defendants declined to notify Plaintiffs of such terminations,\n\nPlaintiffs have been unable to mitigate these injuries by providing assistance before these federal\n\nemployee residents became unemployed. Pls.\u2019 Mot. at 28-29. An injunction reinstating affected\n\nemployees and requiring Defendants to comply with RIF procedures, including notice procedures,\n\nto conduct any further mass layoffs of probationary employees will redress these injuries, at least\n\nin part so that Plaintiffs can prepare for the economic fallout.\n\n       E.      Informational Injury.\n\n       Finally, Plaintiffs are being harmed via textbook informational injury, through Defendants\u2019\n\nfailure to provide information\u2014advance notice of federal reductions in force (\u201cRIFs\u201d)\u2014as\n\nrequired by governing statutes and regulations. The Fourth Circuit recently reiterated that Article\n\nIII injury is shown via the deprivation of information required to be disclosed by statute. Laufer v.\n\nNaranda Hotels, LLC, 60 F.4th 156, 171-72 (4th Cir. 2023). Here, Defendants failed to satisfy\n\ntheir statutory obligation to provide 60 days\u2019 advance notice to Plaintiffs before conducting RIFs\u2014\n\nand they have similarly provided no information as to the location and circumstances of future\n\nRIFs. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d)(3)(A)(i); 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.803(b)(1). This informational injury would\n\nbe ameliorated by an order compelling Defendants to identify affected employees and enjoining\n\nthem from terminating probationary employees en masse without abiding by proper RIF\n\n\n                                                  4\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 19        Filed 03/10/25      Page 6 of 19\n\n\n\nprocedures, including proper notice procedures.\n\n II.   THIS COURT CAN REVIEW PLAINTIFFS\u2019 CLAIMS.\n\n       A.      This Court has jurisdiction to review Plaintiffs\u2019 claims under Thunder\n               Basin.\n\n       In other cases related to the mass termination of probationary employees, the federal\n\ngovernment has argued that the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (\u201cFSL-\n\nMRS\u201d) and the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (\u201cCSRA\u201d) preclude district-court jurisdiction\n\nunder the Thunder Basin doctrine. Those claims were recently rejected by the U.S. District Court\n\nfor the Northern District of California as to non-union plaintiffs, and if raised here, they should\n\nfail for similar reasons. See Mem. Op. & Order Amending TRO, Am. Fed\u2019n of Gov\u2019t Emps. v. Off.\n\nof Pers. Mgmt., No. 3:25-cv-1780 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 28, 2025) [hereinafter \u201cAFGE v. OPM\u201d], ECF\n\n45 at 11-13. The FLS-MRS and CSRA commit ordinary employment disputes between employees\n\nor labor organizations to the jurisdiction of agency tribunals. But Plaintiffs are not asserting\n\ngarden-variety employment claims. Instead, they challenge Defendants\u2019 failure to provide\n\nstatutorily mandated notice before conducting a RIF, resulting in ongoing irreparable harms for\n\nwhich the FSL-MRS and the CSRA provide no administrative review and no remedy.\n\n       In Thunder Basin Coal Co. v. Reich, the Supreme Court established a two-step framework\n\nfor determining whether Congress has divested district courts of jurisdiction over agency action.\n\n510 U.S. 200, 207 (1994). First, the court must \u201cask whether Congress\u2019s intent to preclude district-\n\ncourt jurisdiction is \u2018fairly discernible in the statutory scheme.\u2019\u201d Bennett v. U.S. Sec. & Exch.\n\nComm\u2019n, 844 F.3d 174, 181 (4th Cir. 2016) (quoting Thunder Basin, 510 U.S. at 207). \u201cThis\n\ninvolves examining the statute\u2019s text, structure, and purpose.\u201d Id. (citing Elgin v. Dep\u2019t of\n\nTreasury, 567 U.S. 1, 10 (2012)). Second, the court must \u201cask whether plaintiffs\u2019 \u2018claims are of\n\nthe type Congress intended to be reviewed within this statutory structure.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting Thunder\n\n\n\n                                                  5\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 19        Filed 03/10/25      Page 7 of 19\n\n\n\nBasin, 510 U.S. at 212). At this second stage, the court considers three factors: \u201c(1) whether the\n\nstatutory scheme \u2018foreclose[s] all meaningful judicial review\u2019\u201d; \u201c(2) the extent to which the\n\nplaintiff\u2019s claims are \u2018wholly collateral\u2019 to the statute\u2019s review provisions\u201d; and \u201c(3) whether\n\n\u2018agency expertise could be brought to bear on the . . . questions presented.\u2019\u201d Id. (alteration in\n\noriginal) (quoting Thunder Basin, 510 U.S. at 212-13). \u201c[M]eaningful judicial review is the most\n\nimportant factor in the Thunder Basin analysis.\u201d Bennett, 844 F.3d at 183 n.7.\n\n       Application of the Thunder Basin factors confirms that this Court has jurisdiction. With\n\nrespect to Thunder Basin step one, the CSRA\u2019s administrative review scheme does not display a\n\n\u201cfairly discernible\u201d intent to limit jurisdiction over Plaintiffs\u2019 claims, Thunder Basin, 510 U.S. at\n\n207, because these state claims are not \u201cof the type Congress intended to be reviewed within th[e]\n\nstatutory structure,\u201d id. at 212. Indeed, the CSRA\u2019s administrative scheme focuses solely on the\n\nrights of employees and labor organizations, and it channels their disputes to the Merit Systems\n\nProtection Board (\u201cMSPB\u201d) and the Federal Labor Relations Authority (\u201cFLRA\u201d). See 5 U.S.C.\n\n\u00a7\u00a7 7105, 7512. In contrast, states are not subject to these constraints because, by its own terms,\n\nthis statutory structure governs only employees and labor organizations, and consequently\n\naddresses only those parties\u2019 avenues for review. See id. \u00a7 7103(a)(1)-(2) (defining, for the\n\npurposes of the FSL\u2011MRS, a \u201cperson\u201d to mean \u201can individual, labor organization, or agency,\u201d and\n\nan \u201cemployee\u201d to mean \u201can individual employed in an agency\u201d or \u201cwhose employment in an\n\nagency has ceased\u201d because of unfair labor practices); id. \u00a7 7123 (outlining review for any \u201cperson\n\naggrieved by any final order\u201d of the FLRA); id. \u00a7 7703 (addressing review of MSPB orders\n\naffecting \u201cemployee[s]\u201d or \u201capplicant[s] for employment\u201d). As a result, the channeling analysis\n\nends at Thunder Basin step one, and Plaintiffs\u2019 claims should proceed in federal court.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 6\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 19        Filed 03/10/25      Page 8 of 19\n\n\n\n       Even if this Court were, however, to proceed to step two of Thunder Basin, the Court\n\nclearly has jurisdiction based on each of the three governing factors. First, Plaintiffs are asserting\n\na \u201chere-and-now injury\u201d that cannot be redressed absent immediate judicial review. Axon Enter.,\n\nInc. v. FTC, 598 U.S. 175, 192 (2023). A statutory scheme fails to provide meaningful judicial\n\nreview if an appeal to an Article III court is not available \u201cin due course.\u201d Rydie v. Biden, No. 21-\n\n2359, 2022 WL 1153249, at *5 (4th Cir. Apr. 19, 2022) (quoting Bennett, 844 F.3d at 186). This\n\nis precisely the situation here. States are different from employee- and union-litigants who may\n\noften \u201cobtain review of and relief from the [defendants\u2019 actions] by litigating [their] claims through\n\nthe statutory scheme\u201d before the FLRA or MSPB. Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Agric. Emps. v. Trump, 462 F.\n\nSupp. 3d 572, 583 (D. Md. 2020) (internal quotation marks omitted). States cannot engage in\n\ncollective bargaining as a union can and thus cannot bring a concrete bargaining dispute before the\n\nFLRA. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7123 (only a \u201cperson\u201d may seek judicial review of an FLRA order). Nor\n\nare states \u201cemployee[s]\u201d or \u201capplicant[s] for employment\u201d who can initiate suits before the MSPB.\n\nId. \u00a7 7703. Cf. Texas v. United States, 809 F.3d 134, 164 (5th Cir. 2015) (reviewing Texas\u2019s\n\nchallenge to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, despite a reticulated statute\n\npresenting barriers to judicial review, because Texas was not bringing a \u201ccause or claim by or on\n\nbehalf of any alien\u201d but rather \u201cassert[ing] [its] own right to the [Administrative Procedure Act\u2019s]\n\nprocedural protections\u201d); Texas v. United States, 50 F.4th 498, 521 (5th Cir. 2022) (similar).\n\n       Further, Plaintiffs seek relief that cannot be obtained in an administrative tribunal\u2014the\n\nMSPB and FLRA can only redress individual employees\u2019 damages, such as by ordering \u201cback pay\n\nand related benefits.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1214(g)(2); see id. \u00a7\u00a7 7105(g)(3), 7118(a)(7)(D). But even if the\n\nterminated employees were eventually reinstated and awarded back pay, it would not undo\n\nPlaintiffs\u2019 injuries. Plaintiffs need immediate relief from the current administrative burdens and\n\n\n\n\n                                                  7\n\f        Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 19        Filed 03/10/25      Page 9 of 19\n\n\n\neconomic harms imposed on them by the lack of notice and Defendants\u2019 unlawful terminations,\n\nsee Pls.\u2019 Mot. Part III, and any reinstatement of employees that would be ordered through the slow-\n\nmoving administrative process would \u201ccome too late to be meaningful\u201d to Plaintiffs, Axon, 598\n\nU.S. at 191. Said differently, without direct judicial review, Plaintiffs would be left with no review\n\nand no remedy at all to vindicate their statutory right to notice before federal agencies conduct\n\nRIFs.\n\n        Second, Plaintiffs\u2019 claims about lack of notice are \u201cwholly collateral\u201d to the CSRA\u2019s\n\nadministrative review scheme. Thunder Basin, 510 U.S. at 212. Plaintiffs\u2019 claims \u201chave nothing\n\nto do with\u201d the labor-related matters that the MSPB and the FLRA \u201cregularly adjudicate\u201d between\n\nunions, employees, and employers. Axon, 598 U.S. at 193. Plaintiffs are not challenging the \u201ctype\n\nof personnel action covered by\u201d the CSRA, United States v. Fausto, 484 U.S. 439, 448 (1988),\n\nbecause they are challenging the Defendants\u2019 failure to provide them notice of the RIFs, not a\n\npersonnel decision.\n\n        Third, for similar reasons, the MSPB and FLRA lack the expertise to handle Plaintiffs\u2019\n\nclaims. While agencies have \u201cexpertise\u201d to offer on \u201cpreliminary questions unique to the\n\nemployment context,\u201d Elgin, 567 U.S. at 22, this expertise presumes individualized adjudications\n\nof typical employee disputes. Plaintiffs\u2019 claims\u2014that Defendants are indiscriminately targeting\n\nlarge portions of agency workforces as part of a broader effort to gut the civil service, without any\n\nwarning or consideration of state interests\u2014are not of the kind that these agencies adjudicate. See\n\nAxon, 598 U.S. at 194.\n\n        B.     Plaintiffs\u2019 claims are reviewable under the Administrative Procedure\n               Act (\u201cAPA\u201d) and as ultra vires because there are no other avenues for\n               Plaintiffs to obtain the relief they seek.\n\n        The federal government has similarly argued elsewhere that APA and ultra vires claims\n\nregarding probationary employees are precluded because there is an alternative avenue for relief\n\n\n                                                  8\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 19        Filed 03/10/25       Page 10 of 19\n\n\n\nunder the FSL-MRS or the CSRA. Opp\u2019n to Mot. for TRO, AFGE v. OPM, ECF 33 at 18, 21. For\n\nall the reasons set forth supra, see Part II.A, neither the FSL-MRS nor the CSRA provide an avenue\n\nfor relief for Plaintiffs, let alone an \u201cadequate\u201d avenue for relief. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 704 (APA review\n\navailable when there is \u201cno other adequate remedy\u201d); Bd. of Governors of the Fed. Rsrv. Sys. v.\n\nMcCorp. Fin., Inc., 502 U.S. 32, 43-44 (1991) (similar regarding ultra vires causes of action).\n\n       Section 704 of the APA was \u201cintended to avoid . . . duplication,\u201d by limiting judicial\n\nreview to instances where no other \u201cadequate remedy\u201d exists. Bacardi & Co. v. U.S. Patent &\n\nTrademark Off., 104 F.4th 527, 535 (4th Cir. 2024) (internal quotation marks omitted). But it\n\nshould not be construed to \u201cdefeat the [APA\u2019s] central purpose of providing a broad spectrum of\n\njudicial review of agency action.\u201d Id. (alteration in original) (quoting Bowen v. Massachusetts, 487\n\nU.S. 879, 903 (1988)). Accordingly, judicial review is barred only when alternative procedures are\n\ntruly \u201cadequate.\u201d U.S. Army Corps of Engineers v. Hawkes Co., Inc., 578 U.S. 590, 600-01 (2016)\n\n(emphasis added); Bowen, 487 U.S. at 901 (rejecting the \u201cnovel\u201d contention that a claim is \u201cbarred\u201d\n\nwhen there is only \u201cdoubtful and limited relief available\u201d elsewhere). As this Circuit has put it: the\n\nmere fact that \u201ca similar result could be achieved by challenging a different \u2018agency action\u2019 does\n\nnot demonstrate that an \u2018adequate remedy\u2019 in court is available for this distinct \u2018agency action.\u2019\u201d\n\nBacardi, 104 F.4th at 535 (quoting 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 704). That is precisely the situation here\u2014the mere\n\nfact that affected employees can challenge the particular personnel actions that led to their\n\nterminations in administrative proceedings does not mean that this Court is precluded from\n\nreviewing Plaintiffs\u2019 distinct challenges to Defendants\u2019 unlawful RIFs, including Defendants\u2019\n\nfailure to provide the notice required by law. The same holds true for Plaintiffs\u2019 ultra vires claims.\n\nSee Bd. of Governors, 502 U.S. at 43-44 (ultra vires claims barred where there is another\n\n\u201cmeaningful and adequate opportunity for judicial review\u201d).\n\n\n\n\n                                                  9\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 19       Filed 03/10/25      Page 11 of 19\n\n\n\nIII.   THIS COURT SHOULD GRANT PLAINTIFFS\u2019 REQUESTED RELIEF.\n\n       A.        Plaintiffs urgently require the requested relief, without which they will\n                 suffer irreparable harm.\n\n       This Court\u2019s intervention is urgently needed. As explained in Plaintiffs\u2019 TRO Motion, the\n\nrolling termination of massive numbers of federal employees has created chaos. Plaintiffs have\n\nstruggled to mitigate the administrative and financial burdens associated with a sharp uptick in\n\nfederal unemployment claims; plan and budget for the deployment of job transition and social\n\nservices; and facilitate connections between impacted workers, potential employers, and partner\n\norganizations. Plaintiffs request three forms of relief, each of which is justified under the\n\ncircumstances.\n\n       First, this Court should restrain Defendants from terminating any probationary employees\n\nwithout making specific, individualized determinations regarding the inadequacy of the\n\nemployee\u2019s conduct or performance or abiding by proper RIF procedures, including the state\n\nnotice procedures. This relief is appropriate because it would limit Defendants to terminating\n\nprobationary employees in accordance with governing regulations, and would bar them from\n\nconducting further RIFs under the guise of evaluating probationary employees. Further, a pause\n\non unlawful mass firings of probationary employees is essential to preserve the status quo and stem\n\nthe growing chaos and confusion that these firings have caused. See, e.g., Roe v. Dep\u2019t of Def., 947\n\nF.3d 207, 217, 234 (4th Cir. 2020) (affirming injunction prohibiting the Air Force from \u201cseparating\n\nor discharging from military service\u201d individuals \u201cdue to their HIV-positive status\u201d). Plaintiffs\n\nneed this pause on further unlawful mass firings of probationary employees to prevent further\n\nadministrative burdens on their unemployment insurance systems, further impacts on their\n\nbudgets, and further increased demands on their social services.\n\n\n\n\n                                                10\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 19        Filed 03/10/25      Page 12 of 19\n\n\n\n       Second, to preserve the status quo, this Court should grant immediate relief reinstating\n\nprobationary employees who were terminated on or after January 20, 2025, as part of mass\n\nterminations that did not comply with RIF procedures and were not based on individual\n\ndeterminations of conduct or performance. This relief is in lockstep with this Circuit\u2019s case law,\n\nwhich emphasizes that the status quo is the \u201clast uncontested status between the parties which\n\npreceded the controversy.\u201d League of Women Voters of N.C. v. North Carolina, 769 F.3d 224, 236\n\n(4th Cir. 2014) (quoting Pashby v. Delia, 709 F.3d 307, 320 (4th Cir. 2013)). In other words, the\n\n\u201cstatus quo\u201d is the \u201cstatus quo ante.\u201d Holt v Cont\u2019l Grp., Inc., 708 F.2d 87, 90 (2d Cir. 1983)\n\n(emphasis omitted). And \u201cit is sometimes necessary to require a party who has recently disturbed\n\nthe status quo to reverse its actions\u201d in order to \u201crestore[]\u201d \u201cthe status quo ante.\u201d Di Base v. SPX\n\nCorp., 872 F.3d 224, 231 (4th Cir. 2017) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\n       This principle has been applied across the country, including where employees seek\n\nreinstatement during the pendency of litigation, and in other analogous circumstances, to mandate\n\naffirmative actions on the part of Defendants to restore the status quo. See, e.g., Holt, 708 F.2d at\n\n90 (characterizing litigant\u2019s request for reinstatement of employment as \u201ca restoration of the status\n\nquo ante\u201d); Bly v McLeod, 605 F.2d 134, 137 (4th Cir 1979) (TRO allowing plaintiffs to vote by\n\nabsentee ballot preserved the status quo); Christopher P. v. Marcus, 915 F.2d 794, 805 (2d Cir.\n\n1990) (TRO readmitting plaintiff to a school that had discharged him \u201cpreserve[d] the status quo\u201d).\n\nAnd, here, Plaintiffs should not be limited in their available relief because Defendants fired\n\nprobationary employees without notice and in a blunderbuss fashion before legal recourse could\n\nbe sought. N. Am. Soccer League, LLC v. U.S. Soccer Fed. Inc., 883 F.3d 32, 37 n.5 (2d Cir. 2018)\n\n(Defendant may not \u201cseek[] shelter under a current \u2018status quo\u2019 precipitated by their wrongdoing\u201d).\n\nReinstatement is necessary to restore the status quo during the pendency of this suit.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 11\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 19        Filed 03/10/25      Page 13 of 19\n\n\n\n       Third, the Court should also order Defendants to file a status report with the Court within\n\n48 hours of entry of a temporary restraining order, and at regular intervals thereafter, identifying\n\nunder seal all probationary employees terminated on or after January 20, 2025 (including the\n\nfollowing information for each employee: agency, name, position title, grade, termination date,\n\nwhether the probationary employee has been reinstated, and the date of any reinstatement). This\n\ninformation is needed to ensure Defendants\u2019 compliance and, in the event employees are not\n\nreinstated, to cure Plaintiffs\u2019 informational injuries by enabling Plaintiffs to identify individuals\n\nsubject to workforce rehabilitation efforts and rapid response activities. These irreparable\n\ninformational injuries\u2014which have real consequences\u2014worsen by the day, making this distinct\n\nform of relief appropriate.\n\n       B.      Emergency relief is needed to prevent further irreparable harms to\n               Plaintiffs.\n\n       Finally, Defendants may argue that relief is no longer required because OPM recently\n\nrevised its directive to federal agencies to terminate probationary employees en masse and because\n\nthe MSPB has recently granted temporary relief to some U.S. Department of Agriculture\n\nemployees. Not so.\n\n       OPM\u2019s revisions do not cure Plaintiffs\u2019 ongoing harms. After a U.S. District Court in the\n\nNorthern District of California ordered OPM to rescind its directive to terminate probationary\n\nemployees, OPM made a two-sentence edit to its prior guidance. It stated that OPM was \u201cnot\n\ndirecting agencies\u201d to take any particular action with regard to probationary employees and that\n\nagencies retain \u201cauthority\u201d and \u201cresponsibility\u201d for \u201cpersonnel actions.\u201d See Pls.\u2019 Mot. at 21. This\n\nwordsmithing does not reflect a credible shift in OPM policy\u2014OPM continues to assert that\n\n\u201cevaulat[ing] probationary employees\u201d is one \u201ctool[]\u201d agencies may use to achieve \u201cworkforce\n\noptimization.\u201d Memo. from Russell T. Vought, Dir., Off. Of Mgmt, & Budget & Charles Ezell,\n\n\n\n                                                 12\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 19        Filed 03/10/25      Page 14 of 19\n\n\n\nActing Dir., OPM, to Heads of Executive Dep\u2019ts & Agencies 1-3 (Feb. 26, 2025),\n\ntinyurl.com/mr2bum3d.\n\n       More importantly, OPM\u2019s edit tells this Court nothing about whether the other agency\n\nDefendants will cease mass, unannounced firings of probationary employees. It simply purports\n\nto turn the keys over to them. And by all accounts, Defendant agencies will not stop the\n\nterminations. Since the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California issued its\n\ndecision, agencies have continued mass layoffs. On or around March 3, the Department of\n\nCommerce fired 73 probationary employees. Compl. \u00b6 137. That same day, the Department of\n\nDefense issued a memorandum stating that it is \u201ctaking independent steps to reduce the size of the\n\ncivilian workforce,\u201d including \u201cterminating those probationary employees whose continued\n\nemployment . . . would not be in the public interest.\u201d1 And in line with that policy, throughout the\n\nweek of March 3 through March 7, the Defense Logistics Agency fired approximately 100\n\nprobationary employees, the Defense Health Agency fired dozens of probationary employees, and\n\nthe Navy also terminated probationary employees. 2\n\n       Although a handful of agencies, e.g., the Center for Disease Control, have voluntarily\n\nreinstated some probationary employees, Plaintiffs are not aware of any Defendant agency\n\nannouncing that it will reinstate all unlawfully fired employees and cease any future unlawful\n\nfirings of probationary employees. Nor have the Plaintiffs heard of any plans by Defendants to\n\noffer them notice regarding still- or soon-to-be-terminated employees.\n\n\n\n       1\n           Memo. For Senior Pentagon Leadership, DOD (Mar. 3, 2025), tinyurl.com/yc6bn5yb.\n       2\n        Patricia Kime et al., Firings Begin at the Pentagon: Veterans, Civil Servants Caught in\nthe Crosshairs, Military.com (Mar. 5, 2025), tinyurl.com/bdaydyft; Lauren C. Williams &\nBradley Peniston, At least one Pentagon agency has begun firing probationary workers, Defense\nOne (Mar. 5, 2025), tinyurl.com/mvp3sv9e; Meghann Myers, Pentagon is placing probationary\nemployees on leave in advance of mass firings, Defense One (Mar. 7, 2025), tinyurl.com/njjv84vr.\n\n\n                                                13\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 19        Filed 03/10/25      Page 15 of 19\n\n\n\n       Recent MSPB proceedings do not grant Plaintiffs the relief they seek. Defendants may\n\nalso argue that a recent 45-day stay of unlawful terminations issued by the Merit Systems\n\nProtection Board obviates the need for emergency relief against the U.S. Department of\n\nAgriculture. Not so. That stay temporarily reinstates fired employees at that one agency so that the\n\nU.S. Office of Special Counsel may \u201cfurther investigate[]\u201d the firings. Special Counsel ex rel. John\n\nDoe v. Dept. of Agriculture, No. CB-1208-25-0020-U-1 at 2 (Mar. 5, 2025), tinyurl.com/espc3ap7.\n\nBut that investigation was spearheaded by Special Counsel Hampton Dellinger, whom the\n\nPresident fired. See Dellinger v. Bessent, No. 25-5052 (D.C. Cir. Mar. 5, 2025) (vacating\n\ntemporary restraining order and giving \u201ceffect to the removal of [Dellinger] from his position as\n\nSpecial Counsel\u201d). As far as Plaintiffs are aware, Dellinger has not been replaced as head of this\n\none-Officer agency, leaving the Office headless and essentially inoperative. So, no investigation\n\nmay occur, and the stay will expire in just over a month\u2014or potentially even sooner if the\n\nDepartment of Agriculture moves for reconsideration. Given this uncertainty, any relief should\n\ninclude the Department of Agriculture.\n\n\n                                         CONCLUSION\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs\u2019 motion should be granted, and the Court should issue\n\nthe proposed temporary restraining order.\n\n\n\n\n                                                14\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 19      Filed 03/10/25     Page 16 of 19\n\n\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nANTHONY G.

LY? | A\nAO b\n\nx * * * * * * % * * *\n\nPLAINTIFFS\u2019 MOTION TO SEAL EXHIBITS M-EE TO PLAINTIFFS\u2019\nMOTION FOR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER\n\nPlaintiffs States hereby move under Local Rule 105.11 to seal Exhibits M-EE in\nsupport of Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order. As explained below this\nCourt should grant the motion because the exhibits\u2014declarations from recently\nterminated probationary federal employees\u2014contain sensitive personal information that\nthe public has no interest in seeing. There is no viable alternative to sealing. So much of\nthe information in the declarations is sensitive that redaction would not provide the public\nwith appreciably more information about the scope and extent of probationary employee\nterminations. Declarants also have reasonable concerns about reprisal if their declarations\n\nare publicly available.\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document10 _ Filed 03/07/25 Page 2of17\nCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document6 Filed 03/07/25 Page 2of15\n\nLEGAL STANDARD\n\n\u201cThe right of public access derives from two independent sources: the First\nAmendment and the common law.\u201d Jn re U.S. for an Ord. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Section\n2703(D), 707 F.3d 283, 290 (4th Cir. 2013). The common law presumes a right of public\naccess to all judicial records and documents that can be rebutted by competing interests,\nsuch as whether the records are sought for improper purposes, whether release would\nenhance the public\u2019s understanding of an important historical event, and whether the\npublic already has access to the information in the records. /d. (citing Jn re Knight Publ\u2019g\nCo., 743 F.2d 231, 235 (4th Cir. 1984)). The First Amendment right of access only\napplies to certain judicial records such as complaints, summary judgment motions and\nexhibits, rulings on summary judgment motions, and docket sheets. Courthouse News\nService v. Smith, 126 F.4th 899, 907 (4th Cir. 2025). The First Amendment permits\nsealing these records when it is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling governmental\ninterest. Butler v. DirectSAT USA, LLC, 47 F. Supp. 3d 300, 316 (D. Md. 2014).\n\nARGUMENT\n\nExhibits M-EE are declarations from probationary federal employees whose\nemployment has been terminated since January 20, 2025. They should be sealed because\nthey contain sensitive personal information that the common law does not entitle the\n\npublic to see, and the First Amendment right of access does not apply.\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document10 _ Filed 03/07/25 Page 3of17\nCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document6 Filed 03/07/25 Page 3of15\n\nEach declaration contains sensitive personal information. They include the\ndeclarant\u2019s annual salary and grade and step levels. They describe the declarant\u2019s formal\nperformance evaluations and informal feedback on their job performance for employees\nwho were not employed long enough to receive a performance evaluation. They include\ndirect quotes from emails notifying them of the termination of their employment. They\nalso describe how declarants\u2019 responses to sudden unemployment, including whether\nthey have applied for unemployment, Medicaid, or other public benefits for themselves or\ntheir families, and how their daily lives and spending are affected.\n\nThese declarations should be sealed in their entirety because the declarants have\nstrong reasons to keep their sensitive personal information out of public view. See Butler,\n47 F. Supp. 3d at 316. Although the recent mass layoffs of federal employees are a matter\nof public concern, specific and individualized information about the employees who have\nbeen terminated will not advance the public\u2019s understanding of this public issue. See Jn re\nKnight Publ'g Co., 743 F.2d at 235 (favoring sealing if information will not advance\npublic understanding). The public does not already have personal information about\nemployee salaries, performance reviews, or their plans to apply for public benefits. /d.\n(also favoring sealing if the information is not already public). And the declarants have\nreasonable and specific concerns about reprisal if their declarations are available to the\npublic. Many have already applied for other jobs and others are seeking reinstatement\n\ninto their former positions with the federal government and they reasonably believe that\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB_ Document10 Filed 03/07/25 Page 4of17\nCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document6 Filed 03/07/25 Page 4 of 15\n\npublic statements about the circumstances of their termination could jeopardize these job\nprospects. Others fear that identifying the specific offices where they worked could\nexpose their former federal colleagues still employed in those offices to reprisal. And\nthere is no viable alternative to sealing these declarations in their entirety. See Local Rule\n105.11. Redaction of their names is not sufficient, because the declarations also identify\ntheir job titles, the specific geographic locations and offices where they worked, which is\nsufficient information to uniquely identify them. The common law standard plainly\njustifies sealing.\n\nThe First Amendment only applies to certain types of judicial records, such as\ncomplaints, summary judgment motions and exhibits, rulings on summary judgment, and\ndocket sheets. Courthouse News Service, 126 F.4th at 907. Here the Plaintiff States\u2019\nComplaint is already public. Plaintiff States are seeking emergency relief, not summary\njudgment, so the employee declarations are not necessary to allow the public to\nunderstand the basis of the Court\u2019s ruling on the merits.\n\nFor these reasons, the Plaintiff States respectfully move to seal Exhibits M-EE.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB Document 6\n\nANTHONY G.

As explained below this\n\nCourt should grant the motion because the exhibits\u2014declarations from recently\n\nterminated probationary federal employees\u2014contain sensitive personal information that\n\nthe public has no interest in seeing. There is no viable alternative to sealing. So much of\n\nthe information in the declarations is sensitive that redaction would not provide the public\n\nwith appreciably more information about the scope and extent of probationary employee\n\nterminations. Declarants also have reasonable concerns about reprisal if their declarations\n\nare publicly available.\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB        Document 6      Filed 03/07/25    Page 2 of 15\n\n\n\n\n                                  LEGAL STANDARD\n\n       \u201cThe right of public access derives from two independent sources: the First\n\nAmendment and the common law.\u201d In re U.S. for an Ord. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Section\n\n2703(D), 707 F.3d 283, 290 (4th Cir. 2013). The common law presumes a right of public\n\naccess to all judicial records and documents that can be rebutted by competing interests,\n\nsuch as whether the records are sought for improper purposes, whether release would\n\nenhance the public\u2019s understanding of an important historical event, and whether the\n\npublic already has access to the information in the records. Id. (citing In re Knight Publ\u2019g\n\nCo., 743 F.2d 231, 235 (4th Cir. 1984)). The First Amendment right of access only\n\napplies to certain judicial records such as complaints, summary judgment motions and\n\nexhibits, rulings on summary judgment motions, and docket sheets. Courthouse News\n\nService v. Smith, 126 F.4th 899, 907 (4th Cir. 2025). The First Amendment permits\n\nsealing these records when it is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling governmental\n\ninterest. Butler v. DirectSAT USA, LLC, 47 F. Supp. 3d 300, 316 (D. Md. 2014).\n\n                                      ARGUMENT\n\n       Exhibits M-EE are declarations from probationary federal employees whose\n\nemployment has been terminated since January 20, 2025. They should be sealed because\n\nthey contain sensitive personal information that the common law does not entitle the\n\npublic to see, and the First Amendment right of access does not apply.\n\n\n\n\n                                             2\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB        Document 6      Filed 03/07/25     Page 3 of 15\n\n\n\n\n       Each declaration contains sensitive personal information. They include the\n\ndeclarant\u2019s annual salary and grade and step levels. They describe the declarant\u2019s formal\n\nperformance evaluations and informal feedback on their job performance for employees\n\nwho were not employed long enough to receive a performance evaluation. They include\n\ndirect quotes from emails notifying them of the termination of their employment. They\n\nalso describe how declarants\u2019 responses to sudden unemployment, including whether\n\nthey have applied for unemployment, Medicaid, or other public benefits for themselves or\n\ntheir families, and how their daily lives and spending are affected.\n\n       These declarations should be sealed in their entirety because the declarants have\n\nstrong reasons to keep their sensitive personal information out of public view. See Butler,\n\n47 F. Supp. 3d at 316. Although the recent mass layoffs of federal employees are a matter\n\nof public concern, specific and individualized information about the employees who have\n\nbeen terminated will not advance the public\u2019s understanding of this public issue. See In re\n\nKnight Publ'g Co., 743 F.2d at 235 (favoring sealing if information will not advance\n\npublic understanding). The public does not already have personal information about\n\nemployee salaries, performance reviews, or their plans to apply for public benefits. Id.\n\n(also favoring sealing if the information is not already public). And the declarants have\n\nreasonable and specific concerns about reprisal if their declarations are available to the\n\npublic. Many have already applied for other jobs and others are seeking reinstatement\n\ninto their former positions with the federal government and they reasonably believe that\n\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\f        Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB        Document 6      Filed 03/07/25     Page 4 of 15\n\n\n\n\npublic statements about the circumstances of their termination could jeopardize these job\n\nprospects. Others fear that identifying the specific offices where they worked could\n\nexpose their former federal colleagues still employed in those offices to reprisal. And\n\nthere is no viable alternative to sealing these declarations in their entirety. See Local Rule\n\n105.11. Redaction of their names is not sufficient, because the declarations also identify\n\ntheir job titles, the specific geographic locations and offices where they worked, which is\n\nsufficient information to uniquely identify them. The common law standard plainly\n\njustifies sealing.\n\n       The First Amendment only applies to certain types of judicial records, such as\n\ncomplaints, summary judgment motions and exhibits, rulings on summary judgment, and\n\ndocket sheets. Courthouse News Service, 126 F.4th at 907. Here the Plaintiff States\u2019\n\nComplaint is already public. Plaintiff States are seeking emergency relief, not summary\n\njudgment, so the employee declarations are not necessary to allow the public to\n\nunderstand the basis of the Court\u2019s ruling on the merits.\n\n       For these reasons, the Plaintiff States respectfully move to seal Exhibits M-EE.\n\n\n\n                                                  Respectfully submitted,\n\n\n\n\n                                              4\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB        Document 6        Filed 03/07/25   Page 5 of 15\n\n\n\n\nANTHONY G.

Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(a), (b).\n\nPlaintiffs seek to restrain and enjoin Defendants, from terminating federal probationary\n\nemployees without making specific, individualized determinations regarding the\n\ninadequacy of the employee\u2019s conduct or performance, or without complying with\n\nrequirements applicable to Reductions in Force procedures. Plaintiffs further seek an order\n\nreinstating probationary employees unlawfully fired by Defendants, and an order\n\ncompelling Defendants to file a status report with the Court within 48 hours, and at regular\n\nintervals thereafter, identifying terminated probationary employees and describing the\n\nsteps Defendants have taken to comply with the Court\u2019s Order.\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 4    Filed 03/07/25   Page 2 of 13\n\n\n\n       The requested relief is warranted because Plaintiffs are likely to show that the\n\nDefendants actions violate the Administrative Procedure Act and are ultra vires;\n\nDefendants\u2019 ongoing, unlawful mass firings of federal probationary employees are causing\n\nPlaintiff States irreparable injury in multiple ways; and the balance of hardships and the\n\npublic interest are both in Plaintiffs\u2019 favor.\n\n       WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs request that the Court enter an order:\n\n           A. Temporarily restraining Defendants from terminating federal probationary\n\n              employees without making specific, individualized determinations regarding\n\n              the inadequacy of the employee\u2019s conduct or performance;\n\n           B. Compelling Defendants to reinstate federal probationary employees fired on\n\n              or after January 20, 2025, as part of mass terminations that did not comply\n\n              with RIF procedures and were not based on individual determinations of\n\n              conduct or performance;\n\n           C. Requiring Defendants to file a status report with the Court within 48 hours,\n\n              and at regular intervals thereafter, identifying under seal all probationary\n\n              employees terminated on or after January 20, 2025 (including the following\n\n              information for each employee: agency, name, position title, grade,\n\n              termination date, whether the probationary employee has been reinstated, and\n\n              the date of any reinstatement) and describing all steps Defendants have taken\n\n              to comply with the Court\u2019s Order.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 2\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB        Document 4        Filed 03/07/25   Page 3 of 13\n\n\n\n\n                                                 Respectfully submitted,\n\nANTHONY G.

These\n\nmass firings were executed illegally, without proper process or the statutorily required notice to\n\nPlaintiff States. States are now left to pick up the pieces of the shattered federal workforce\u2014\n\naddressing numerous unemployment compensation requests and helping our residents seek new\n\njobs as each new wave of terminations crests. This Court should halt the unlawful firings now.\n\n       Since taking office on January 20, President Trump has made clear his desire to\n\n\u201cdramatically reduce the size of the federal workforce.\u201d In keeping with that directive, the Office\n\nof Personnel Management (\u201cOPM\u201d) directed agencies to terminate the bulk of the roughly 220,000\n\nprobationary employees serving in the federal government, i.e., those who have generally been in\n\ntheir positions for less than two years. To execute these marching orders, OPM provided agencies\n\nwith stock language that cites the employees\u2019 performance as the reason for their terminations.\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 4-1        Filed 03/07/25     Page 11 of 43\n\n\n\nThe Defendant agencies have followed OPM\u2019s directives, using boilerplate language to unlawfully\n\nfire probationary employees by the hundreds or thousands\u2014all without any advance notice or\n\nwarning to Plaintiff States. Defendants have not made official statistics available, but public\n\nreporting indicates that they have already terminated roughly 24,000 probationary employees in\n\njust over three weeks, and that more terminations are expected any day.\n\n       These unannounced mass layoffs have created growing chaos and confusion. Thousands\n\nof affected individuals have been fired and must now make pressing decisions about healthcare,\n\nunemployment benefits, and reemployment. For help, they are turning to Plaintiff States, who are\n\nresponsible under both federal and state law for supporting their unemployed residents. But states\n\nare struggling to fulfill these obligations effectively without the forewarning required by federal\n\nlaw. States need notice to prepare for and mitigate the administrative burdens associated with a\n\nsharp uptick in federal unemployment claims; to plan and budget for the deployment of job\n\ntransition and social services; and to facilitate connections between impacted workers, potential\n\nnew employers, and partner organizations.\n\n       By firing tens of thousands of civil servants en masse without notice and under false\n\npretenses, Defendants have impeded the ability of Plaintiff States to perform this essential work.\n\nAnd those harms are ongoing. The effective dates of employees\u2019 terminations are occurring on a\n\nrolling basis, and public reporting indicates that more terminations are imminent. States, however,\n\ngenerally have no idea how many of their residents have been or will be fired, or when such\n\nterminations occur, until employees begin requesting state benefits. And, because of the haphazard\n\nway these firings occurred, adjudicating employees\u2019 eligibility for unemployment benefits will\n\nrequire an outsized expenditure of resources. Beyond that, states are suffering from other injuries,\n\nincluding decreased income and sales tax revenues due to the unlawful mass firings.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 2\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 4-1       Filed 03/07/25     Page 12 of 43\n\n\n\n       None of this is legal. Civil servants\u2014including probationary employees\u2014may generally\n\nbe fired only after a finding of unsatisfactory performance or misconduct, or else as part of a\n\nreduction in force (\u201cRIF\u201d). While the template termination language provided by OPM generically\n\ncites performance, that is clearly not the basis for these terminations. Instead, Defendant agencies\n\nare engaged in unlawful RIFs to shrink the size of the federal workforce. But to conduct a RIF,\n\nfederal law requires 60 days\u2019 advance notice to affected employees and\u2014importantly for Plaintiff\n\nStates\u2014requires 60 days\u2019 advance notice to states and local governments. See 5 U.S.C.\n\n\u00a7 3502(d)(3)(A) (requiring notice to states when 50 or more employees will be released from\n\nwithin a \u201ccompetitive area\u201d); 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.803(b) (same). These notice requirements are\n\ndesigned to mitigate the harms of large-scale federal firings\u2014to give federal employees an\n\nopportunity to seek new jobs, which in turn reduces the strain on state social services, and to give\n\nstates an adequate opportunity to address the inevitable fallout. Defendants\u2019 actions have\n\nextinguished these vital safeguards.\n\n       To prevent further irreparable harm, this Court should grant immediate relief (1) restraining\n\nDefendants from terminating any probationary employees without making specific, individualized\n\ndeterminations regarding the inadequacy of the employee\u2019s conduct or performance, (2) reinstating\n\nprobationary employees who were terminated on or after January 20, 2025, as part of mass\n\nterminations that did not comply with RIF procedures and were not based on individual\n\ndeterminations of conduct or performance, and (3) ordering Defendants to file a status report with\n\nthe Court within 48 hours of entry of a temporary restraining order, and at regular intervals\n\nthereafter, identifying under seal all probationary employees terminated on or after January 20,\n\n2025 (including the following information for each employee: agency, name, position title, grade,\n\ntermination date, whether the probationary employee has been reinstated, and the date of any\n\n\n\n\n                                                 3\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 4-1           Filed 03/07/25   Page 13 of 43\n\n\n\nreinstatement), and reporting all steps Defendants have taken to comply with the Court\u2019s order.\n\n\n                                          BACKGROUND\n\nA.     Legal Framework.\n\n           a. Probationary employees.\n\n       Under civil service laws, new employees and certain employees who have changed offices\n\nor recently received a promotion are subject to probationary or trial periods. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7101\n\net seq. For employees in the \u201ccompetitive\u201d service, the \u201cprobationary period\u201d is one year, id.\n\n\u00a7 7511(a)(1)(A)(ii); for employees in the \u201cexcepted\u201d service, there is a similar \u201cwaiting period\u201d of\n\ntwo years, id. \u00a7 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii).1 Defendants\u2019 mass terminations have affected both competitive\n\nand excepted service employees, and for ease of reference, this brief refers to both groups as\n\n\u201cprobationary\u201d employees. A federal agency may generally terminate a probationary employee\n\nonly: (1) for cause or (2) as part of a reduction in force.\n\n       Under OPM regulations, a federal agency may lawfully terminate a probationary employee\n\nfor \u201cunsatisfactory performance or conduct\u201d if their \u201cwork performance or conduct . . . fails to\n\ndemonstrate [their] fitness or [their] qualifications for continued employment.\u201d 5 C.F.R.\n\n\u00a7 315.804(a). To invoke this provision, however, an employer \u201cmust honestly be dissatisfied with\n\nthe probationer\u2019s conduct or performance after giving him a fair trial on the job.\u201d McGuffin v. SSA,\n\n942 F.3d 1099, 1102 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (internal quotation marks omitted); Shaw v. United States,\n\n622 F.2d 520 (Ct. Cl. 1980) (similar).2 And the agency must notify the terminated employee in\n\nwriting \u201cas to why he is being separated and the effective date of the action,\u201d including \u201cthe\n\n\n       1\n        Competitive service employees are hired through an open, competitive hiring process and\nexcepted service employees are appointed through a non-competitive hiring process.\n       2\n          Probationary employees may also be terminated \u201cfor reasons based\u2026on conditions\narising before [their] appointment.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.805.\n\n\n                                                   4\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 4-1           Filed 03/07/25   Page 14 of 43\n\n\n\nagency\u2019s conclusions as to the inadequacies of his performance or conduct.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.804(a);\n\nid. \u00a7 316.304.

It must then rank employees for retention based on their tenure group, time\n\nin service (including military service), veteran preference, length of service, and performance. See\n\n5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(a); 5 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 351.501-351.504. These RIF regulations expressly extend to\n\nprobationary employees and, in fact, grant probationary employees some retention preferences.\n\nSee 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.202(a), (b); id. \u00a7 351.501(b).\n\n       RIF notices to Plaintiff States. Further, under a RIF, agencies are required to provide\n\nadvance notice to affected employees and, in circumstances relevant here, to states and local\n\ngovernments. An employee \u201cmay not be released\u201d as part of a RIF \u201cunless\u201d they receive 60 days\u2019\n\n\u201cwritten notice\u201d that provides information on reemployment and career transition assistance, and\n\nalso includes the option to share the employee\u2019s \u201cresume and other relevant employment\n\ninformation for employment referral\u201d with the \u201cState unit or entity established under title I of the\n\nWorkforce Investment Act of 1998.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d); 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.803(a). And when a RIF\n\nwill result in the termination of \u201c50 or more employees in a competitive area,\u201d an agency must\n\n\u201cprovide written notification of the action at the same time it issues specific notices of separation\n\nto employees\u201d to \u201c[t]he State or the entity designated by the State to carry out rapid response\n\nactivities under title I of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998,\u201d and also to \u201c[t]he chief elected\n\nofficial of local government(s) within which these separations will occur.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.803(b);\n\nsee 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d)(3)(A) (same). This notice requirement is absolute: Absent such notice, \u201can\n\nemployee may not be released . . . due to a reduction in force.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d)(1).\n\n       Generally, this notice must be provided 60 days before any employee is terminated. See\n\n\n\n\n                                                 6\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 4-1       Filed 03/07/25      Page 16 of 43\n\n\n\n5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d)(1)(B). When a RIF is caused by circumstances \u201cnot reasonably foreseeable,\u201d a\n\nshorter notice period may apply\u2014but even then, the notice period must \u201ccover at least 30 full days\n\nbefore the effective date of release.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.801(b); 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(e). The notice\n\nprovided to States and local officials must detail: (a) the number of employees to be separated,\n\nbroken down by geographic area; (b) when those separations will occur; and (c) any other\n\ninformation that may facilitate the delivery of state and local services to affected workers. See\n\n5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d)(3)(B); 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.803(c).\n\n           c.

While some agencies had already begun to\n\nterminate probationary employees by the dozens prior to OPM\u2019s directive, still more agencies\n\nimmediately followed OPM\u2019s directive by firing probationary employees by the hundreds and, in\n\nmany instances, thousands. On February 13, the Department of Energy terminated nearly 2,000\n\nemployees, the Department of Veterans Affairs terminated over 1,000 employees, and the\n\nDepartment of Agriculture terminated around 3,400 employees.

Id. \u00b6\u00b6 102-40. Every single one of these terminations has occurred without proper notice\n\nto Plaintiff States, and Defendants have not provided notice of any forthcoming layoffs.\n\n       In carrying out the terminations, the agencies have largely relied on the template\n\ntermination language provided by OPM, which generally stated that the employees were being\n\nterminated because their \u201cability, knowledge, and skills do not fit the Agency\u2019s current needs, and\n\n[their] performance has not been adequate to justify further employment at the Agency.\u201d Ex.

Andrea Hsu, Judge says Trump\u2019s mass firing of federal employees is illegal\n\nand should be stopped, NPR (Feb. 27, 2025), tinyurl.com/myw4bjdh. Some termination letters\n\n\n       4\n          Many employees who were purportedly terminated for unsatisfactory performance had\nrecently received stellar performance reviews. See, e.g., Ex. W, Sealed Decl. \u00b6 11 (\u201cOutstanding\u201d);\nEx. X, Sealed Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 12 (\u201cExceeds Expectations\u201d).\n\n\n                                                10\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 4-1       Filed 03/07/25      Page 20 of 43\n\n\n\nnoted expressly that the individual was being terminated \u201c[p]er OPM instructions.\u201d Schwartz Decl.\n\nAFGE v. OPM, ECF 39-4 \u00b6 10.\n\n       The leadership of at least one agency\u2014the National Science Foundation (\u201cNSF\u201d)\u2014told its\n\nemployees that their termination letters were \u201cboilerplate\u201d provided by OPM, and that they were\n\n\u201cfollowing orders\u201d and \u201cha[d] no choice.\u201d Frassetto Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 20. NSF leadership stated that their\n\ninitial decision to retain probationary employees had been overruled by OPM, which directed the\n\nagency to \u201cremove probationers\u201d and provided them with only two justifications for these\n\nremovals: \u201cperformance or conduct.\u201d Id. at 26, 30; see Ex. HH, DiMartini Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 5-6; Ex. GG,\n\nGrant Decl. \u00b6 11. The agency opted for \u201cperformance\u201d to preserve terminated employees\u2019 ability\n\nto \u201capply for unemployment.\u201d Frassetto Decl. at 26, 30; Evans Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 27-28. Leadership at one\n\nagency also \u201cdiscussed openly in meetings\u201d that the agency \u201cdid not review or consider actual job\n\nperformance or conduct\u201d of any terminated probationary employee. Ex. HH, DiMartini \u00b6 16; Ex.\n\nGG, Grant Decl. \u00b6 19 (similar regarding terminations at another agency). OPM\u2019s directive is \u201ca\n\npolitical effort to reduce headcount\u201d but \u201cwithout following the rules of a RIF.\u201d Ex. HH, DiMartini\n\nDecl. \u00b6\u00b6 15, 18; Ex. GG, Grant Decl. \u00b6 21 (same). Indeed, some agencies have now confirmed, in\n\nresponse to unemployment claims, that terminations were not done for cause, but were instead due\n\nto a \u201creduction in force\u201d or else a \u201cpermanent lack of work due to a change in Presidential\n\nAdministration.\u201d Ex. A, MD DOL Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 61-62.\n\n       On February 26, OPM issued additional guidance directing agencies to submit plans for\n\nbroader RIFs of federal employees by March 13.

Id. at 2-3. On March 3, following a district court order to OPM to rescind its\n\ndirective to terminate probationary employees,5 OPM revised its earlier January 20 guidance to\n\nstate: \u201cOPM is not directing agencies to take any specific performance-based actions regarding\n\nprobationary employees. Agencies have ultimate decision-making authority over, and\n\nresponsibility for, such personnel actions.\u201d Memo. from Charles Ezell, Acting Dir., OPM, to Heads\n\nof Executive Dep\u2019ts & Agencies 2 (Mar. 4, 2025), tinyurl.com/yf6vmhpy. To Plaintiff States\u2019\n\nknowledge, however, no Defendant agency has announced that it will reinstate all unlawfully fired\n\nemployees, or cease mass firings of probationary employees based on OPM\u2019s revised language.\n\n            b. States are grappling with a sudden uptick in unemployed residents and an\n               unplanned spike in demand for public services.\n\n       Since around January 20, many Plaintiff States have received a surge in unemployment\n\nbenefits claims filed by former federal employees. See, e.g., Ex. A, MD DOL Decl. \u00b6 50 (813\n\nclaims); Ex. E, IL IDES Decl. \u00b6 15 (446); Ex. H, NJ DOL Decl. \u00b6 14 (388); Ex. D, CA EDD Decl.\n\n\u00b6 30 (1,621); Ex. J, NY DOL Decl. \u00b6 4 (550); Ex. KK, CO DLE Decl. \u00b6 15 (544). These are already\n\nmaterial increases in the number of claims filed compared to the same period last year for many\n\nstates. See, e.g., Ex. A, MD DOL Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 50, 52 (330% increase); Ex. KK, CO DLE Decl. \u00b6 15\n\n(303%); Ex. H, NJ DOL Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 33-34 (273%); Ex. D, CA EDD Decl. \u00b6 30 (149%); Ex. E, IL\n\nIDES Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 15-16 (almost the same number of claims filed in last several weeks as in all of\n\n2024); Ex. F, MA EOLWD Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 16-17 (\u201csignificant uptick\u201d); Ex. J, NY DOL Decl. \u00b6 4\n\n(\u201csignificant increase\u201d). This surge is only beginning because the effective dates for some\n\nterminations have not yet passed and there will be a delay between when individuals are fired and\n\nwhen they likely apply for benefits. But the trend is already clear. In the last few weeks, the\n\n\n\n       5\n           See AFGE v. OPM, ECF 45.\n\n\n                                               12\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 4-1        Filed 03/07/25     Page 22 of 43\n\n\n\nMaryland Department of Labor has received approximately 30 to 60 claims every day. Ex. A, MD\n\nDOL Decl. \u00b6 18; see also, e.g., Ex. KK, CO DLE Decl. \u00b6 15 (20-30 claims per day).\n\n       Yet Plaintiff States\u2019 departments of labor have received no notice of these terminations.\n\nSee, e.g., Ex. A, MD DOL Decl. \u00b6 16; Ex. H, NJ DOL Decl. \u00b6 13; Ex. E, IL IDES Decl. \u00b6 29; Ex.\n\nD, CA EDD Decl. \u00b6 13; Ex. F, MA EOLWD Decl. \u00b6 15; Ex. C, AZ DES \u00b6 10; Ex. J, NY DOL\n\nDecl. \u00b6 8; Ex. K, OR OWI Decl. \u00b6 14; Ex. KK, CO DLE Decl. \u00b6 14. As a result, Plaintiff States\n\ncannot identify workers subjected to federal mass layoffs who are entitled to rapid response\n\nservices and assistance with their benefits claims without devoting significant time, resources, and\n\nexpense. Plaintiff States must affirmatively contact various federal agencies, monitor public\n\nreporting, rely on word-of-mouth, and conduct mass outreach to identify impacted workers,\n\ndetermine if additional firings will occur, and to attempt to provide services to those employees.\n\nSee, e.g., Ex. A, MD DOL Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 19-22, 22-23; Ex. H, NJ DOL Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 17-18; Ex. E, IL IDES\n\nDecl. \u00b6 29; Ex. D, CA EDD Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 16-17, 19; Ex. F, MA EOLWD Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 18-22; Ex. K, OR\n\nOWI Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 15-19. Some Plaintiff States also are diverting or expecting to divert staff from other\n\npressing projects and retrain them to provide these services. See, e.g., Ex. A, MD DOL Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 24-\n\n28 (diverting several individuals from working on state matters such as occupational and\n\nprofessional licensing oversight, financial regulation, and state-funded workforce development\n\nprojects); Ex. H, NJ DOL Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 18, 20; Ex. E, IL IDES Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 31-33; Ex. F, MA EOLWD\n\nDecl. \u00b6\u00b6 24-30. Other Plaintiff States have even created websites for terminated federal employees\n\nto assist them in seeking unemployment compensation and reemployment resources. See, e.g.,\n\nAmber Anderson, DC launches unemployment website for federal workers amid job status chaos,\n\nWUSA9 (Feb. 25, 2025), tinyurl.com/4ec8cfsx; Ex. A, MD DOL Decl. \u00b6 29; Ex. E, IL IDES Decl.\n\n\u00b6 32. And another Plaintiff State set up a dedicated telephone line. Ex. D, CA EDD Decl. \u00b6 19.\n\n\n\n\n                                                13\n\f        Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 4-1         Filed 03/07/25      Page 23 of 43\n\n\n\n                                      STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n         Temporary restraining orders are designed to preserve the status quo during the pendency\n\n  of litigation.

Ramirez, 594 U.S. 413, 423 (2021). Here, Plaintiff States are\n\n  suffering a series of concrete and irreparable harms because of Defendants\u2019 failure to provide\n\n  notice required by law, and their unlawful firings. See supra B.b; infra Part III. These harms\n\n  include \u201ca direct injury in the form of a loss of specific tax revenues,\u201d Wyoming v. Oklahoma, 502\n\n  U.S. 437, 438 (1992), as well as harms to the operations of state agencies and informational harms,\n\n  infra Part III.

PLAINTIFF STATES ARE LIKELY TO SUCCEED ON THE MERITS.\n\n              Plaintiff States are likely to succeed in showing that Defendants have violated the APA\n\n      and that their actions are ultra vires.\n\n              A.      Defendants have violated the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\n              This Court may review multiple final agency actions taken in violation of the law: OPM\u2019s\n\n      January 20, February 13, and 14 directives to terminate probationary employees en masse, and\n\n      Defendants\u2019 unlawful RIFs\u2014i.e., their termination of tens of thousands of probationary employees\n\n      for non-performance reasons. These acts are contrary to law and arbitrary and capricious.\n\n                   a. Defendants\u2019 actions are reviewable final agency actions.\n\n              Under the APA, the Court may review the lawfulness of a \u201cfinal agency action.\u201d 5 U.S.C.\n\n      \u00a7\u00a7 702, 704. \u201cAgency action\u201d is defined expansively to include \u201cthe whole or a part of an agency\n\n      rule, order, license, sanction, relief, or the equivalent or denial thereof, or failure to act,\u201d id.\n\n      \u00a7 551(13), which \u201ccover[s] comprehensively every manner in which an agency may exercise its\n\n      power,\u201d Whitman v. Am. Trucking Ass\u2019ns, 531 U.S. 457, 478 (2001). An agency action is \u201cfinal\u201d\n\n      when it is the \u201cconsummation of the agency\u2019s decisionmaking process\u201d and is an action \u201cby which\n\n      rights or obligation have been determined, or from which legal consequences will flow.\u201d Bennett\n\n      v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 177-78 (1997) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).\n\n              Here, there are two types of \u201cfinal agency actions\u201d at issue. First, the directives that OPM\n\n      issued to agencies on January 20, February 13, and February 14 to terminate probationary\n\n      employees are final agency actions. As the Fourth Circuit instructs, \u201ca court should consider the\n\n      practical effect of the agency\u2019s determination\u201d when assessing finality. Chamblee v. Espy, 100\n\n      F.3d 15, 17 (4th Cir. 1996) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). Here, OPM\u2019s\n\n      directives were \u201cdefinitive\u201d and with \u201cimmediate practical effects.\u201d Flue-Cured Tobacco Coop.\n\n      Stabilization Corp. v. EPA, 313 F.3d 852, 856 (4th Cir. 2002). In response to these directives,\n\n\n                                                       15\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 4-1        Filed 03/07/25      Page 25 of 43\n\n\n\nagencies have terminated tens of thousands of federal employees. Thousands of additional\n\nterminations are likely imminent. The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California\n\nrecently held, based on a \u201cmountain of evidence,\u201d that OPM \u201cunlawfully direct[ed] the mass\n\ntermination of probationary employees across a wide range of federal agencies,\u201d AFGE v. OPM,\n\nECF 45 at 8-9, and that its actions were reviewable, id. at 9, 11-13.6 And OPM\u2019s recent two-\n\nsentence modification to its directive, stating that OPM is not directing mass firings, does not moot\n\nthis issue. The directive continues to instruct agencies to take steps to fire probationary employees,\n\nand neither OPM nor Defendant agencies have sought to undo the harm caused by this directive,\n\nnamely to fully remediate the termination of probationary employees.\n\n       Second, Defendants\u2019 unlawful RIFs\u2014that is, their termination of tens of thousands of\n\nemployees for non-performance reasons, without notice\u2014are final agency actions subject to this\n\nCourt\u2019s review. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2). Agencies must comply with \u201cnon-discretionary\u201d procedural\n\nmandates when a RIF is initiated. See, e.g., Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska v. Babbitt, 915 F. Supp.\n\n157, 165-66 (D.S.D. 1996) (APA review is available when the issue before the Court is \u201cnot the\n\ndecision to issue the RIF or the procedure for implementing the RIF\u201d but \u201cthe defendant\u2019s failure\n\nto comply with the duty to consult . . . prior to making the decision\u201d). And few other actions are\n\nas \u201cfinal\u201d as a termination. Burdue v. FAA, 774 F.3d 1076, 1080 (6th Cir. 2014) (employee\n\ntermination is a \u201cfinal agency action\u201d); Ex. O, Sealed Decl. \u00b6 5 (citing Ex. 1 (\u201cfinal decision\u201d)).\n\n\n\n       6\n          Specifically, the court in that case ordered OPM to rescind its January 20 memo, February\n14 email, and all other efforts to \u201cdirect the termination of employees\u201d at six federal agencies.\nAFGE v. OPM, ECF No. 45 at 24. That decision reaches only OPM and its director (because they\nwere the only named defendants) and does not require federal agencies to halt terminations or\nperform other mandatory duties\u2014it therefore does not remedy Plaintiff States\u2019 injuries in this case.\nTo crystallize the point: regardless of whether the Defendant agencies here were following OPM\u2019s\ndirective, they conducted unlawful RIFs. The relief granted in AFGE v. OPM does not encompass\nthe relief that Plaintiff States seek here, including reinstatement of terminated employees.\n\n\n                                                 16\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 4-1        Filed 03/07/25      Page 26 of 43\n\n\n\n           b. Defendants\u2019 failure to provide notice to states is contrary to law.\n\n       Agency actions taken \u201cin excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short\n\nof statutory right,\u201d or that are otherwise \u201cnot in accordance with law,\u201d cannot withstand judicial\n\nreview. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A), (C). The rule in this Circuit is clear: \u201cAn agency of the government\n\nmust scrupulously observe rules, regulations, or procedures which it has established. When it fails\n\nto do so, its actions cannot stand and courts will strike it down.\u201d Morris v. McCaddin, 553 F.2d\n\n866, 870 (4th Cir. 1977) (compiling authorities); Fed. Defenders of N.Y., Inc. v. Fed. Bureau of\n\nPrisons, 954 F.3d 118, 130 (2d Cir. 2020) (explaining that it is a \u201cdeeply rooted principle[] of\n\nadministrative law, not to mention common sense, [that] government agencies are generally\n\nrequired to follow their own regulations\u201d) (collecting authorities).\n\n       Congress delegated to OPM the authority to promulgate regulations that agencies must\n\nfollow in implementing RIFs. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(a). And, exercising this authority, OPM has issued\n\ndetailed RIF procedures that expressly encompass the separation of probationary employees. See\n\ngenerally C.F.R. Part 351; see also 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.202(a), (b); id. \u00a7 351.501(b); id. \u00a7 351.502 (a),\n\n(b). Critically, an agency \u201cshall\u201d conduct a RIF when it separates employees, or places them on\n\nfurlough for more than 30 days, \u201cbecause of lack of work; shortage of funds; insufficient personnel\n\nceiling; or reorganization.\u201d Id. \u00a7 351.201(a)(2). That is precisely what happened here\u2014\n\nprobationary employees have been separated because the new Administration seeks a massive\n\nreorganization of the federal government. See supra B.a; Ex. HH, DiMartini Decl. \u00b6 16 (OPM\n\nsought to \u201creduce headcount\u201d). And when an agency conducts a RIF, it must provide advance\n\nnotice to states and local governments when 50 or more employees will be terminated in a\n\ncompetitive area. 5 U.S.C \u00a7 3502; 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.803.\n\n       The Defendant agencies were required to follow RIF procedures in conducting mass firings\n\nof probationary employees\u2014including the state notice procedures. The Defendants\u2019 performance-\n\n\n                                                 17\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 4-1        Filed 03/07/25      Page 27 of 43\n\n\n\nbased reasons for terminating probationary employees are clearly pretextual and the firings are,\n\ninstead, part of the new Administration\u2019s efforts to massively restructure and reduce the size of the\n\nfederal workforce. See supra B.a. Indeed, the purportedly performance-based mass terminations\n\nwere pretextual because they were conducted directly pursuant to OPM\u2019s orders, and because they\n\nwere effectuated without a good faith assessment of performance or conduct.\n\n       As to OPM\u2019s orders, these firings have largely occurred at OPM\u2019s direction even though,\n\nas a federal court recently recognized, \u201c[n]o statute\u2014anywhere, ever\u2014has granted OPM the\n\nauthority to direct the termination of employees in other agencies.\u201d AFGE v. OPM, ECF 45 at 7.\n\nYet OPM provided agencies with direction and boilerplate termination language that is untethered\n\nfrom any particularized assessment of performance or conduct. Agencies used that language to\n\nterminate tens of thousands of employees in a matter of days\u2014and have admitted that they were\n\n\u201cfollowing orders\u201d and \u201cha[d] no choice.\u201d Frassetto Decl. \u00b6 20.\n\n       The mass firings are also pretextual because they were performed without any good faith\n\nassessment of performance or conduct, or often without any assessment at all. As a former Human\n\nCapital Officer for the IRS explained, \u201cTreasury did not review or consider the actual job\n\nperformance or conduct of any IRS probationary employee when issuing the termination notices,\u201d\n\na fact that was \u201cdiscussed openly in meetings.\u201d Ex. HH, DeMartini Decl. \u00b6 14. And a recently\n\nterminated Deputy Director for Operations of one agency similarly explained that the termination\n\nof probationary employees in his unit was \u201cnot based on any individualized assessment of the\n\nprobationary employees.\u201d Ex. GG, Grant Decl. \u00b6 19. Indeed, the relevant human resources official\n\n\u201cnever read a single person\u2019s resume, never spoke with any of the terminated probationary\n\nemployees, and had no personal knowledge of their individual performance.\u201d Ex. GG, Grant Decl.\n\n\u00b6 19. It is therefore unsurprising that, in responding to inquiries from state labor departments about\n\n\n\n\n                                                 18\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 4-1        Filed 03/07/25      Page 28 of 43\n\n\n\nunemployment benefits, agencies have in some cases admitted that separations occurred due to a\n\n\u201creduction in force,\u201d and due a \u201cpermanent lack of work due to a change in Presidential\n\nAdministration.\u201d See Ex. A, MD DOL Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 61-62.\n\n       Because Defendants are broadly terminating employees to shrink the federal workforce,\n\nthey are conducting a RIF, and are accordingly in violation of statutes and regulations governing\n\nthe RIF process. The law requires the provision of 60 days\u2019 notice to \u201c[t]he State or the entity\n\ndesignated by the State to carry out rapid response activities under title I of the Workforce\n\nInvestment Act of 1998,\u201d and also to \u201c[t]he chief elected official of local government(s) within\n\nwhich these separations will occur.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.803(b); see 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d)(3)(A).7 There\n\nis nothing discretionary about these notice requirements. Congress made its intention clear by\n\nusing mandatory language: \u201cNotice . . . shall be given.\u201d Id. \u00a7 3502(d)(3)(A) (emphasis added).\n\nAnd the agencies\u2019 own regulations reiterate that \u201cthe agency must provide written notification\u201d to\n\nstates. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.803(b) (emphasis added); cf. Heelen v. Dep\u2019t of Com., 154 F.3d 1306, 1309\n\n(Fed. Cir. 1998) (noting that an agency must \u201cdemonstrat[e] . . . compliance with proper RIF\n\nprocedures\u201d). Defendants have simply ignored these statutory and regulatory commands, making\n\ntheir actions contrary to law.\n\n           c. Defendants\u2019 actions are arbitrary and capricious.\n\n       The APA also prohibits agencies from engaging in arbitrary and capricious action. 5 U.S.C.\n\n\u00a7 706(2)(A). Agency action must be premised on \u201creasoned decisionmaking.\u201d Dep\u2019t of Homeland\n\nSec. v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal., 591 U.S. 1, 16 (2020). Generally, an agency may not \u201crel[y]\n\non factors that Congress did not intend for it to consider, entirely ignore[] important aspects of the\n\n\n       7\n         As noted above, because Defendants have not conducted lawful RIFs, they have not yet\ndefined the precise \u201ccompetitive areas\u201d at issue\u2014but it is beyond dispute that tens of thousands of\nprobationary employees have been fired to date.\n\n\n                                                 19\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 4-1        Filed 03/07/25      Page 29 of 43\n\n\n\nproblem, explain[] its decision in a manner contrary to the evidence before it, or reach[] a decision\n\nthat is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a difference in view.\u201d Bedford Cnty. Memorial\n\nHosp. v. HHS, 769 F.2d 1017, 1022 (4th Cir. 1985) (citing Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. State\n\nFarm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)). The rationale proffered by the agency also\n\nmust be the actual reason for the agency\u2019s action. Dep\u2019t of Com. v. New York, 588 U.S. 752, 780,\n\n785 (2019). It cannot be \u201cpretextual\u201d or \u201ccontrived.\u201d Id. Here, OPM\u2019s directives and the agencies\u2019\n\nimplementation of them are arbitrary or capricious for at least three reasons.\n\n       First, Defendants failed to consider important aspects of the problem before terminating\n\nprobationary employees en masse and without any advance warning or notice. State Farm Mut.,\n\n463 U.S. at 43. To survive arbitrary-and-capricious review, an agency must demonstrate that it\n\n\u201cconsidered the factors relevant to its decision and articulated a rational connection between the\n\nfacts found and the choice made.\u201d Keating v. FERC, 569 F.3d 427, 433 (D.C. Cir. 2009). That did\n\nnot happen here. To begin, Defendants ignored the downstream effects of firing tens of thousands\n\nof employees without warning. That was a mistake. For one thing, the effects on states are\n\nprofound. Those include, among other things, an unexpected spike in unemployment of federal\n\nworkers, an increase in demand for public services, a decrease in tax revenue, and the expenditure\n\nof significant time and resources to support a growing unemployed population. See infra Part III.\n\nMoreover, the Defendants\u2014and OPM in particular\u2014did not adequately consider the impact\n\nsudden and unexpected mass terminations would have on agency programming. Without notice,\n\nstates have been deprived of vital resources to protect the public health and ensure emergency\n\npreparedness because the relevant federal employees were terminated\u2014a consequence the\n\nDefendants do not seem to have considered. See, e.g., Ex. I, NJ DOH Decl. \u00b6 5-12. Put another\n\nway, Defendants seem to have engaged in no cost-benefit analysis whatsoever before executing\n\n\n\n\n                                                 20\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 4-1        Filed 03/07/25       Page 30 of 43\n\n\n\nthese unlawful RIFs. That lack of balancing is unreasonable and arbitrary. See, e.g., Michigan v.\n\nEPA, 576 U.S. 743, 759 (2015) (holding that it was \u201cunreasonable\u201d for the agency to treat cost as\n\n\u201cirrelevant\u201d); Bus. Roundtable v. SEC, 647 F.3d 1144, 1148 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (concluding that the\n\nSEC acted arbitrarily where it failed to \u201cadequately . . . assess the economic effects of a new rule\u201d).\n\n       Second, it is arbitrary to abruptly fire thousands of employees without notice or\n\nconsideration of their individual performance and expertise, or the impact on agencies\u2019 ability to\n\ncarry out their statutory duties. Probationary employees are not an undifferentiated mass. Some\n\nare experts who have spent years in government and recently been promoted; some are nearing the\n\ntwo-year mark in federal service; others may have been hired only weeks ago. See 5 C.F.R.\n\n\u00a7 315.801. Some may have higher performance ratings than their non-probationary peers. Some\u2014\n\neven if not \u201cmission critical\u201d\u2014handle essential tasks like overseeing our nuclear weapons program\n\nor preventing the spread of bird flu and other communicable diseases. See Meg Kinnard, A\n\ncomprehensive look at DOGE\u2019s firings and layoffs so far, AP (Feb. 21, 2025),\n\ntinyurl.com/kz4wryed; Ex. I, NJ DOH Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 5-8. Treating all these employees alike, as OPM\n\nrequired, makes no sense. Ex. HH, DiMartini Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 5-7. On-the-ground experience supports\n\nthat commonsense point: Defendants\u2019 actions have succeeded only in creating widespread chaos.\n\nSee Jill Colvin et al., Anger, chaos and confusion take hold as federal workers face mass layoffs,\n\nAP (Feb. 14, 2025), tinyurl.com/4dma39z7.\n\n       Third, Defendants relied on false statements to justify terminating probationary employees\n\nen masse without following RIF procedures. As the U.S. District Court for the Northern District\n\nof California correctly explained, \u201c[r]eliance on facts that an agency knows are false . . . is the\n\nessence of arbitrary and capricious decisionmaking.\u201d AFGE v. OPM, ECF 45 at 10 (quoting\n\nMissouri Serv. Comm\u2019n v. FERC, 337 F.3d 1066, 1075 (D.C. Cir. 2003)). Defendant agencies have\n\n\n\n\n                                                  21\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 4-1        Filed 03/07/25      Page 31 of 43\n\n\n\nclaimed that probationary employees\u2019 \u201cperformance has not been adequate to justify further\n\nemployment at the Agency.\u201d Ex. DD, Sealed Decl. \u00b6 6 (referencing internal Exhibit A). But as\n\ndiscussed, that rationale is false. See supra B.a. Courts are \u201cnot required to exhibit a naivet\u00e9 from\n\nwhich ordinary citizens are free\u201d\u2014they may recognize pretext for what it is. Dep\u2019t of Com., 588\n\nU.S. at 785 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\n       B.      Defendants\u2019 actions are ultra vires.\n\n       Defendants have unlawfully terminated tens of thousands of federal employees without\n\nany statutory authority to do so. \u201cAdministrative agencies are creatures of statute\u201d and \u201cpossess\n\nonly the authority that Congress has provided.\u201d Nat\u2019l Fed\u2019n of Indep. Bus. v. Dep\u2019t of Lab., 595\n\nU.S. 109, 117 (2022). When agencies exercise authority not bestowed on them by Congress, they\n\nact ultra vires, and their actions may be struck down by courts. See, e.g., Sierra Club v. Trump,\n\n963 F.3d 874, 888-93 (9th Cir. 2020), vacated on other grounds, sub nom. Biden v. Sierra Club,\n\n142 S. Ct. 46 (2021); Chamber of Com. of U.S. v. Reich, 74 F.3d 1322, 1327 (D.C. Cir. 1996).\n\n       Defendants exceeded their authority by terminating probationary employees without\n\nfollowing long-established safeguards. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 4303(a) (detailing when terminations may\n\nbe made for cause); id. \u00a7 3502 (detailing RIF requirements). For the same reasons that Defendants\u2019\n\ndefiance of RIF procedures is contrary to law, supra Part II.A.b, it is also ultra vires. Defendants\n\nhave terminated thousands of employees en masse as part of an unlawful RIF without complying\n\nwith their mandatory duty to provide Plaintiff States and affected employees advance notice, nor\n\nhave Defendants observed the detailed retention preferences governing a RIF. See 5 U.S.C.\n\n\u00a7 3502(a); Ex. A, MD DOL Decl. \u00b6 72; Ex. HH, DiMartini Decl. \u00b6 12 (explaining that one agency\n\nwas specifically directed not to carve out veterans when creating the list of probationary employees\n\nto be terminated). See, e.g., Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Postal Supervisors v. UPS, 26 F.4th 960, 960 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2022) (ultra vires claim stated when agency failed to perform a mandatory duty of consultation).\n\n\n                                                 22\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 4-1        Filed 03/07/25       Page 32 of 43\n\n\n\nThis is ultra vires action, plain and simple\u2014the Defendant agencies have \u201cstepped so plainly\n\nbeyond the bounds of [their] statutory authority, or acted so clearly in defiance of it, as to warrant\n\nthe immediate intervention of an equity court.\u201d Fed. Express Corp. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Com., 39 F.4th\n\n756, 763 (D.C. Cir. 2022) (cleaned up).\n\n        The same holds true for OPM\u2019s express directions to agency heads to terminate\n\nprobationary employees in violation of governing RIF statutes and regulations. As one court\n\nrecently observed, \u201c[n]o statute\u2014anywhere, ever\u2014has granted OPM the authority to direct the\n\ntermination of employees in other agencies.\u201d AFGE v. OPM, ECF 45 at 7. In other words, this is\n\nnot a close call. In re Aiken Cnty., 725 F.3d 255, 259 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (\u201c[T]he President [and its\n\nsubordinate agencies] may not decline to follow a statutory mandate or prohibition simply because\n\nof policy objections.\u201d). Plaintiffs are therefore likely to succeed on the merits of this action.\n\nIII.    PLAINTIFF STATES ARE SUFFERING IRREPARABLE INJURIES.\n\n        Plaintiff States also satisfy the second requirement for preliminary relief: showing that\n\n\u201cirreparable injury is likely in the absence of an injunction.\u201d Roe v. Dep\u2019t of Def., 947 F.3d 207,\n\n229 (4th Cir. 2020). Irreparable harm is injury that \u201ccannot fully be rectified by the final judgment\n\nafter trial.\u201d Mountain Valley Pipeline, 915 F.3d at 216.\n\n        Where, as here, a procedural violation is alleged, irreparable harm is demonstrated by\n\npointing to \u201cconcrete interests\u201d affected by the violation, and the irreparable injury that will likely\n\nresult. Ass\u2019n of Cmty. Cancer Ctrs. v. Azar, 509 F. Supp. 3d 482, 500-01 (D. Md. 2020).\n\n\u201c[E]conomic damages may constitute irreparable harm where no remedy is available at the\n\nconclusion of litigation.\u201d Mountain Valley Pipeline, 918 F.3d at 366. This circumstance is present\n\nhere, as Defendants are federal agencies, and no applicable waiver of sovereign immunity permits\n\na suit for damages. Senior Execs. Ass\u2019n v. United States, 891 F. Supp. 2d 745, 755 (D. Md. 2012)\n\n(explaining that \u201cmonetary damages are an inadequate remedy\u201d because they are \u201cunavailable\u201d\n\n\n                                                  23\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 4-1        Filed 03/07/25     Page 33 of 43\n\n\n\ndue to federal sovereign immunity). Further, informational injury can also \u201cbe sufficient to\n\nestablish irreparable harm if the information sought is time-sensitive.\u201d Sai v. Trans. Sec. Admin.,\n\n54 F. Supp. 3d 5, 10 (D.D.C. 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted); see Wash. Post v. Dep\u2019t of\n\nHomeland Sec., 459 F. Supp. 2d 61, 75 (D.D.C. 2006) (similar). Plaintiff States are continuing to\n\nsuffer multiple irreparable injuries due to Defendants\u2019 unlawful mass terminations. These injuries\n\nare exactly what the RIF statutory scheme anticipates and is designed to guard against.\n\n               A.      Irreparable injuries to rapid response efforts.\n\n       Defendants\u2019 failure to notify Plaintiff States of the RIFs has caused Plaintiff States to\n\ndevote significant additional resources to rapid response efforts to assist terminated federal\n\nemployees. These resource diversions would not have occurred and would not continue to occur\u2014\n\nand would not be as severe\u2014if Defendants complied with the notice requirement. For example,\n\nbecause states have not received advance notice of which agencies are planning to conduct mass\n\nlayoffs, many have been forced to divert staff (or anticipate doing so) to contact various federal\n\nagencies, monitor public reporting, and conduct mass outreach to those they believe to be affected.\n\nSee supra Part B.b. Further, a greater number of unemployed residents will likely require rapid\n\nresponse services now than would be the case had lawful RIFs been conducted because, without\n\nnotice, employees have not been able to find new jobs as efficiently and states\u2019 efforts to support\n\nthat search have been stymied.\n\n       Indeed, although Defendants have not supplied states with notice of any RIF, many\n\nPlaintiff States have observed a surge in new claims for unemployment benefits by recently fired\n\nfederal workers. See supra Part B.b. Further, even with many Plaintiff States\u2019 reallocation of\n\nresources, the response to date has been chaotic, less effective, and more costly to the public than\n\nif the required notice had been furnished. See, e.g., Ex. E, IL IDES Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 32-34; Ex. D, CA\n\nEDD Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 19-20. And States cannot prepare and allocate resources for any future mass\n\n\n                                                24\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 4-1        Filed 03/07/25      Page 34 of 43\n\n\n\nterminations without knowing how many employees will be terminated and when.\n\n       These burdens stem from federal agencies\u2019 failure to provide the legally required advance\n\nnotice of mass layoffs, which has left state personnel scrambling to fulfill their statutory duties.\n\nPlaintiff States face irreparable injury from Defendants\u2019 failure to provide time-sensitive\n\ninformation in advance of the terminations\u2014such as the number of employees to be separated,\n\nwhen terminations will occur, and other information critical to preparing for and providing rapid\n\nresponse. See Heritage Found. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of State, No. CV 24-2862 (TJK), 2024 WL 4607501,\n\nat *4 (D.D.C. Oct. 29, 2024) (\u201cirreparable harm\u201d occurs \u201cwhere the requested [information is]\n\ntime-sensitive and highly probative . . . of an imminent event\u201d). Likewise, Plaintiff States suffer\n\nongoing irreparable injury from the increased burdens on their personnel and the need to pull staff\n\naway from state projects. See Cook Cnty. v. Wolf, 962 F.3d 208, 233 (7th Cir. 2020) (irreparable\n\nharm caused by need to \u201cdivert resources away from existing programs\u201d).\n\n               B.      Irreparable injuries to unemployment benefits administration.\n\n       Moreover, because federal agencies have unlawfully conducted RIFs without any warning,\n\nPlaintiff States will suffer irreparable injuries in the administration of their unemployment benefits\n\nprograms. Many states provide unemployment compensation payments to persons who become\n\nunemployed through no fault of their own. For federal workers, these payments are generally\n\nreimbursed by the federal government, who will pay Unemployment Compensation for Federal\n\nEmployees pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8502(a). The federal government also offers grants that cover\n\nsome of the overhead costs of administering unemployment benefits. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 501-503.\n\nHowever, these federal grants are frequently less than the total costs incurred by Plaintiff States to\n\nadminister their unemployment benefits programs. See, e.g., Ex. A, MD DOL Decl. \u00b6 37. As a\n\nresult, many Plaintiff States have often needed to cover the shortage with their own state funds.\n\nSee, e.g., Ex. A, MD DOL Decl. \u00b6 38.\n\n\n                                                 25\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 4-1        Filed 03/07/25      Page 35 of 43\n\n\n\n       The ongoing and unlawful federal RIFs will likely cause a significant administrative\n\nburden and increase costs in unemployment benefit administration, for two primary reasons. First,\n\nthe increase in federal layoffs and the corresponding increase in unemployment claims will impose\n\nadministrative burdens in terms of processing each claim. Many Plaintiff States have seen material\n\nincreases in unemployment claims due to the recent mass firings. See supra Part B.b. Each\n\nadditional claim filed inherently increases states\u2019 administrative burden and expense, some of\n\nwhich is borne by state funds. These administrative costs would have been mitigated had\n\nDefendants provided notice of the terminations, thus alerting employees to seek alternative\n\nemployment and allowing states to assist employees in that search before their termination.\n\n      Second, additional administrative burdens will result from state unemployment benefits\n\ninvestigations necessitated by federal layoffs. When an employer alleges that an employee was\n\nterminated for cause, such as deficient performance or misconduct, Plaintiff States\u2019 laws generally\n\nrequire their claims examiners to investigate the assertion to determine eligibility for\n\nunemployment benefits. See, e.g., Ex. A, MD DOL Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 54-55, 67-72; Ex. H, NJ DOL Decl.\n\n\u00b6\u00b6 29-32; Ex. E, IL IDES Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 10-14; Ex. D, CA EDD Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 31-41; Ex. F, MA EOLWD\n\nDecl. \u00b6\u00b6 46-54; Ex. KK, CO DLE Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 27-28. This labor-intensive process involves, among\n\nother things, fact-finding interviews and written determinations. It also provides for multiple layers\n\nof appeal. Thus, state personnel will be required to conduct time-consuming and expensive\n\nadministrative investigations into these and future unemployment claims. This process will impose\n\nsignificant burdens on state administrative staff, and likely require further outlays of state funds,\n\nconstituting irreparable harm. See, e.g., DeOtte v. State, 20 F.4th 1055, 1068 (5th Cir. 2021) (states\n\nshowed cognizable harm via \u201cfinancial injury\u201d caused by \u201cstrain on [each of] its healthcare\n\nprograms\u201d); Washington v. Trump, No. C25-0127-JCC, 2025 WL 415165, at *5 (W.D. Wash. Feb.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 26\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 4-1         Filed 03/07/25      Page 36 of 43\n\n\n\n6, 2025) (Executive Order creating unrecoverable and \u201csubstantial administrative costs for state\n\nagencies\u201d caused irreparable harm).\n\n               C.      Irreparable injuries to health benefits agencies.\n\n      Plaintiff States also anticipate increased costs to the agencies that enroll new participants in\n\nMedicaid and other health-benefits programs. Without employer-funded insurance, terminated\n\nemployees will need to apply for state-administered insurance programs. See, e.g., Ex. X, Sealed\n\nDecl. \u00b6 7; Ex. W, Sealed Decl. \u00b6 7; Ex. Q, Sealed Decl. \u00b6 7. Fielding questions from terminated\n\nemployees, processing an unexpected influx of applications, and providing other health-benefits\n\nservices will consume state resources and irreparably harm Plaintiff States. See, e.g., Maryland\n\nWorkers Impacted by Recent Federal Actions, Maryland.gov (last visited Mar. 6, 2025),\n\ntinyurl.com/bdfde3bp (providing resources for health coverage to terminated federal employees).\n\n               D.      Irreparable injuries to state programs that depend on federal\n                       workers.\n\n       Plaintiff States also face operational harm to state programming that depended on federal\n\nworkers who were unlawfully fired. See, e.g., Ex. G, MA EOHHS Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 4, 6, 10; Ex. I, NJ DOH\n\nDecl. \u00b6 11; Ex. L, RI DOH Decl. \u00b6 18. For example, some Plaintiff States\u2019 departments of health\n\nrely on federal civil service personnel recruited through the Center for Disease Control and\n\nPrevention\u2019s (\u201cCDC\u201d) Public Health Associate Program (\u201cPHAP\u201d). See, e.g., Ex. I, NJ DOH Decl.\n\n\u00b6\u00b6 5, 13 (citing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 215); Ex. L, RI DOH Decl. \u00b6 7. PHAP associates support \u201ccritical\n\npublic health work through emergency preparedness,\u201d and manage \u201ctime-sensitive cases.\u201d Ex. I,\n\nNJ DOH Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 5, 11; see Ex. L, RI DOH Decl. \u00b6 8. On or around February 15, these associates\u2019\n\npositions were abruptly terminated, and while some associates were later notified that they would\n\nbe reinstated, the sudden loss of essential personnel coupled with the lack of notice caused tangible\n\nharms. Ex. I, NJ DOH Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 10, 11; Ex. L, RI DOH Decl. \u00b6 18. Associates could not \u201censur[e]\n\n\n\n                                                 27\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 4-1        Filed 03/07/25      Page 37 of 43\n\n\n\ntheir files were complete and ready for transition\u201d to other employees, resulting in \u201cadministrative\n\ninefficiencies, duplicative work,\u201d and critical delays in communications with individuals exposed\n\nto communicable diseases, straining the Department\u2019s workforce capacity, with lasting impacts on\n\nits work. Ex. I, NJ DOH Decl. \u00b6 13. Furthermore, one associate will not be returning to their\n\nposition despite reinstatement, id. \u00b6 9, 11-12, and at least one Plaintiff State has \u201cyet to receive\n\nconfirmation\u201d of the reinstatement of associates from CDC\u2014this turmoil is straining at least some\n\nPlaintiff States\u2019 public health capacity. Id. \u00b6 9, 11-12; Ex, L, RI DOH Decl. \u00b6 18.\n\n               E.      Irreparable injuries to state tax base.\n\n       Finally, the unlawful and unnoticed federal mass layoffs will continue to cause irreparable\n\nharm to Plaintiff States\u2019 tax base. See, e.g., Ex. II, MD Comptroller Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 6-10. For example,\n\nthe large-scale terminations of probationary federal workers will cause a significant decline in tax\n\nreceipts for the District of Columbia. The District estimates that its lost income tax revenue for the\n\nfirst 60 days alone, the period in which it should have received advance notice of any RIFs, will\n\ncost the District at least hundreds of thousands of dollars in lost income tax revenue. See Ex. FF,\n\nClower Decl. Ex. B, OCFO Feb. 2025 Revenue Estimates, at 3 (expecting loss in income tax\n\nrevenue to be around hundreds of millions annually, which pro rata suggests millions of dollars\n\nlost in 60 days); see also Ex. FF, Clower Decl. \u00b6 9, tbl. 2 (estimating between hundreds of\n\nthousands to millions of lost income tax revenue in 60 days, depending on number of jobs lost).\n\nSimilarly, the District will likely suffer sustained declines in sales tax revenue. See Ex. FF, Clower\n\nDecl. Ex. B, OCFO Feb. 2025 Revenue Estimates, at 3 (expecting loss in sales tax revenue to be\n\nin the tens of millions annually, suggesting millions of dollars lost in 60 days); Ex. FF, Clower\n\nDecl. \u00b6 9, tbl. 2 (estimating between tens of thousands to millions of lost income tax revenue in 60\n\ndays, depending on number of jobs lost).\n\n       Had the District received the notice required by law, these losses would likely have been\n\n\n                                                 28\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 4-1        Filed 03/07/25      Page 38 of 43\n\n\n\nmitigated, including because some employees would have been able to obtain alternative\n\nemployment prior to their termination. See Ex. FF, Clower Decl. \u00b6 12, tbl. 1, 3 (District\u2019s \u201ctotal\n\ntax losses\u201d for 1,000 federal employee terminations would be $1.1 million per year with notice\n\n(Table 3) compared to $3.9 million per year without notice (Table 1)\u2014an over three-fold increase\n\nin fiscal harm). Such significant financial injury resulting directly from Defendants\u2019 unlawful\n\nterminations constitutes irreparable injury. See, e.g., Washington v. Trump, 441 F. Supp. 3d 1101,\n\n1126 (W.D. Wash. 2020) (\u201closs of the tax revenue associated with\u201d federal action constituted\n\nirreparable injury); North Dakota v. EPA, 127 F. Supp. 3d 1047, 1059 (D.N.D. 2015) (same).\n\nIV.    THE BALANCE OF EQUITIES AND THE PUBLIC INTEREST HEAVILY FAVOR A\n       TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER.\n\n       Here, the public interest favors the Plaintiff States. \u201c[T]he Government cannot suffer harm\n\nfrom an injunction that merely ends an unlawful practice.\u201d C.G.B. v. Wolf, 464 F. Supp. 3d 174,\n\n218 (D.D.C. 2020) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cThere is generally no public interest in the\n\nperpetuation of unlawful agency action.\u201d Am. Fed\u2019n of Tchrs. v. Bessent, No. CV DLB-25-0430,\n\n2025 WL 582063, at *14 (D. Md. Feb. 24, 2025) (quoting League of Women Voters v. Newby, 838\n\nF.3d 1, 12 (D.C. Cir. 2016)). But \u201c\u2018there is a substantial public interest in having governmental\n\nagencies abide by the federal laws\u2019 . . . \u2018that govern their existence and operations.\u2019\u201d Open Cmtys.\n\nAll. v. Carson, 286 F. Supp. 3d 148, 179 (D.D.C. 2017) (quoting League of Women Voters, 838\n\nF.3d at 12). \u201cAnd there is a strong public interest in curing the effects of the government\u2019s unlawful\n\nacts.\u201d Am. Fed\u2019n of Tchrs., 2025 WL 582063, at *14 (internal quotation marks and alterations\n\nomitted). This is especially true in the employment context, as \u201cthe public \u2018undoubtedly has an\n\ninterest in seeing its governmental institutions follow the law and treat their employees in\n\nreasonable, nonarbitrary ways.\u2019\u201d Roe, 947 F.3d 207, 230-31 (4th Cir. 2020) (quoting Roe v.\n\nShanahan, 359 F. Supp. 3d 382, 421 (E.D. Va. 2019)). For the same reasons that Plaintiff States\n\n\n\n                                                 29\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 4-1         Filed 03/07/25      Page 39 of 43\n\n\n\nare likely to succeed on the merits, the equities and public interest require relief.\n\n       There is a particularly strong public interest in ensuring that states are properly notified in\n\nadvance about a forthcoming RIF. Mass terminations of federal employees impose a direct\n\nfinancial and administrative burden on states. As set forth above, Plaintiff States are suffering\n\nadministrative and resource strain, and additional irreparable harms to their economic interests.\n\nSee supra Part III. These harms will only be further exacerbated if the federal government\n\ncontinues to fire probationary employees by the thousands.\n\n       Lastly, the public interests favoring a TRO far outweigh any harms from temporarily\n\nenjoining Defendants from terminating probationary employees and requiring the reinstatement of\n\nprobationary employees who were recently terminated. For decades, federal agencies have hired\n\nand retained probationary employees. These regular expenditures have not caused federal agencies\n\nundue injury in the years that they have been operating, as evidenced by the fact that agencies fired\n\ntheir probationary employees en masse only when ordered to do so by OPM. See, e.g., Frassetto\n\nDecl. \u00b6 18 (the terminations were \u201cnot a decision the agency made\u201d but \u201ca direction [it] received\u201d).\n\nTemporarily enjoining Defendants would \u201cpreserve the status quo during the pendency of\n\nlitigation,\u201d Mountain Valley Pipeline, 915 F.3d at 216 n.8, specifically, the \u201clast uncontested status\n\nbetween the parties which preceded the controversy,\u201d League of Women Voters of N.C., 769 F.3d\n\nat 236. And \u201c[i]t is in the public interest to prevent the[] discharge [of federal employees] for\n\napparently arbitrary and indefensible reasons, at least until the Court can definitively decide the\n\nmerits of plaintiffs\u2019 claims.\u201d Roe, 947 F.3d at 231 (quoting Shanahan, 359 F. Supp. 3d at 421).\n\n\n                                          CONCLUSION\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff States\u2019 motion should be granted, and the Court should\n\nissue the accompanying proposed temporary restraining order.\n\n\n\n                                                  30\n\f    Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 4-1     Filed 03/07/25     Page 40 of 43\n\n\n\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nANTHONY G.

Defendant federal agencies have conducted mass firings of federal\n\nprobationary employees, and those firings are continuing.           Those terminated federal\n\nemployees are increasingly turning to their respective Plaintiff States for assistance,\n\ncausing irreparable injuries to those states, in the form of expense, diverted resources,\n\nadministrative burden, and financial strain, among others.\n\n       2.       Given the continuing harms caused by Defendants\u2019 unlawful mass firings,\n\nMaryland State officials notified representatives of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the\n\nDistrict of Maryland, that Plaintiffs intended to seek a temporary restraining order in this\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB        Document 4-3       Filed 03/07/25    Page 2 of 6\n\n\n\nCourt to enjoin future illegal firings and to order the reinstatement of unlawfully terminated\n\nemployees.\n\n       3.     Given the urgency of this matter, and Plaintiffs\u2019 notification of the\n\nDepartment of Justice, further notice to the Defendants should not be required.\n\n\n\nMarch 7, 2025                       Respectfully submitted,\n\n\n ANTHONY G.

C.A. No. H\n\n United States Department of Agriculture; et al.,\n\n                Defendants.\n\n\n\n                              DECLARATION OF PORTIA Y. WU\n\n       I, PORTIA Y. WU, declare as follows:\n\n\n       1.      I am a resident of the State of Maryland. I am over the age of 18 and have\n\npersonal knowledge of all the facts stated herein, except to those matters stated upon information\n\nand belief; as to those matters, I believe them to be true. If called as a witness, I could and would\n\ntestify competently to the matters set forth below.\n\n       2.      I am currently employed by the Maryland Department of Labor as the Secretary\n\nof Labor.\n\n       3.      The Maryland Department of Labor (MD Labor) is responsible for connecting\n\nMarylanders to good jobs; protecting workers, consumers, and the public; supporting Maryland\n\nbusinesses; and fostering economic growth and competitiveness. The Department administers a\n\nwide range of federally funded workforce and training programs, including but not limited to\n\nthose authorized by the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), that are vital to\n\nMaryland's economic stability and workforce development. The Department is the designated\n\n\n                                                    1\n\f         Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB        Document 4-5       Filed 03/07/25      Page 3 of 17\n\n\nstate agency for oversight and coordination of federally required Rapid Response activities in the\n\nstate.\n\n         4.    As Secretary of Labor, I have access to comprehensive reports and financial\n\nrecords that detail the state of Maryland's labor market, including claims for unemployment\n\nbenefits, and the allocation and distribution of federal funding received by the Maryland\n\nDepartment of Labor. Additionally, my role includes oversight of the implementation and\n\ncompliance of federally funded programs within the agency, ensuring all expenditures align with\n\nfederal guidelines and regulations.\n\n         5.    According to our Department's most recent analysis, there are an estimated\n\n160,000 federal civilian jobs located in Maryland and approximately 250,000 individuals reside\n\nin Maryland who work in federal civilian service. This includes workers stationed in the District\n\nof Columbia who commute from their Maryland residence, and multiple federal agencies that are\n\nphysically located in the state. The average annual earnings for federal civilian jobs in Maryland\n\nis nearly $127,000. At least seven Maryland counties have more than 10,000 residents employed\n\nby the federal government.\n\n         6.      For example, Montgomery County is home to several large federal agencies,\n\nsuch as the National Institutes for Health (which has approximately 18,000 jobs located in\n\nMaryland) and the Food and Drug Administration (which has approximately 13,000 jobs located\n\nin Maryland). Baltimore County is home to the Social Security Administration (which has about\n\n9,000 jobs located in Maryland) and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (which has\n\nnearly 4,000 jobs located in Maryland).\n\n\n\n\n                                                 2\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 4-5       Filed 03/07/25      Page 4 of 17\n\n\n       7.      Furthermore, official estimates of the federal workforce in Maryland undercount\n\nthe number of potentially impacted jobs due to the heavy presence of classified positions, such as\n\nat the National Security Agency located in Anne Arundel County.\n\n       8.      Maryland is also home to a significant military presence, hosting over a dozen\n\nmilitary installations. According to the most recent statistics from the Department of Defense,\n\nthere were 29,564 active-duty military personnel and an additional 17,988 national guard/reserve\n\npersonnel stationed in Maryland as of June 2024 for a total of 47,552 military personnel. Top\n\nbranches of the military represented in Maryland include 9,701 active-duty Navy personnel,\n\n8,468 active duty Air Force personnel, and 7,822 active duty Army personnel.\n\nRapid Response Expenditures\n\n       9.      The Maryland Department of Labor is the designated state agency with\n\nresponsibility for oversight and coordination of statewide Rapid Response activities, required by\n\n29 U.S.C. \u00a7 3174(a)(2)(A) undertaken to provide immediate assistance to Marylanders subject to\n\nmass layoffs. Per 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 682.302, the State Workforce Agency must deliver Rapid\n\nResponse services for mass layoffs that meet the agency's definition of mass layoff, as long as\n\nthe definition does not exceed a minimum threshold of 50 affected workers. In Maryland, \"mass\n\nlayoff' is defined as a layoff from work of 25 or more workers in a single establishment for an\n\nexpected duration of 7 days or more, at the same time, and for the same reason.\n\n       10.     The Maryland Department of Labor oversees state rapid response effort, as\n\nrequired by both the federal Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act 29 U.S.C.\n\n\u00a7 3174(a)(2)(A), and Maryland's Economic Stabilization Act, see Md. Ann. Code Labor and\n\nEmployment, \u00a7 11-303-304 (referred to as \"quick response program\").\n\n\n\n\n                                                 3\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 4-5       Filed 03/07/25      Page 5 of 17\n\n\n       11.     Rapid Response activities are intended to reduce reliance on public benefit\n\nsystems, such as unemployment insurance; to promote economic recovery and vitality by\n\ndeveloping an ongoing, comprehensive approach to identify, plan for, and respond to layoffs and\n\ndislocations; and to prevent or minimize the impact of mass layoffs on workers, businesses, and\n\ncommunities.\n\n\n       12.     Pursuant to both federal and state regulations and policies, when properly notified\n\nof a qualifying event Maryland deploys a coordinated Rapid Response \"team\" comprised of the\n\nDepartment's Dislocated Services Unit (DSU), and Division of Unemployment Insurance staff,\n\nas well as personnel from the state's 13 Local Workforce Development Areas (formal\n\nsubrecipients under WIOA Title I) and the Professional Outplacement Assistance Center.\n\nCollaboratively, these partners are required to provide informational resources and\n\nreemployment services for workers, including information and support for filing Unemployment\n\nInsurance (UI) claims, information regarding health coverage or other benefits, information on\n\nand referral to career services, reemployment-focused workshops and services, and occupational\n\ntraining.\n\n        13.    In addition, the DSU is responsible for contacting affected employers to collect,\n\nverify, and distribute information regarding impact on workers so that services can be rapidly\n\ndeployed. Rapid Response teams, in coordination with the DSU and other listed partners,\n\ncoordinate directly with employers, workers, and relevant partner organizations to provide rapid\n\nsupport and referrals to the American Job Centers located in the affected jurisdictions to provide\n\nsupport for the affected workers. The Division of Unemployment Insurance will mobilize to\n\nstreamline and expedite the processing of unemployment claims.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 4\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB            Document 4-5        Filed 03/07/25       Page 6 of 17\n\n\n       14.     Rapid Response partners also facilitate connections to partner agencies and\n\norganizations to ensure their ability to provide timely assistance to terminated workers and their\n\nfamilies, such as home heating assistance, legal aid, and financial advice. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\n\n3502(d)(3)(A)(i), the federal government is required to provide written notice to Maryland, or\n\n\"the State or entity designated by the State to carry out rapid response activities under section\n\n134(a)(2)(A) of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998\" of a plan for a reduction-in-force (RIF)\n\nof federal employees, generally at least 60 days in advance of any proposed RIF. This period\n\nmay only be shortened upon written notice and in no event shall be less than 30 days. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\n\n3502(e)(3). This notice is to be provided at the same time the federal government issues specific\n\nnotices of separation to employees.\n\n       15.     That notice must include the number of employees to be separated from the\n\nagency/agencies, and the effective date of the separations, as well as other information required\n\nby the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. The notice required by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d)(3)(A) is\n\nintended to trigger Rapid Response activities, since it is explicitly to be given to the state entity\n\nrequired to carry out rapid response activities.\n\n       16.     The Maryland Department of Labor has not received the required advance notice\n\nof a federal reduction in force from any federal agency with locations in the state. Nor, to the\n\nbest of my knowledge, has any other entity in the Maryland State Government received notice of\n\na federal reduction in force.\n\n        17.     Yet, as detailed more below, the Maryland Department of Labor has already\n\nreceived at least 813 claims by ex-federal employees for unemployment benefits since January\n\n21, 2025. The Department is also aware of public announcements of significant layoffs at\n\n\n\n\n                                                   5\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 4-5        Filed 03/07/25      Page 7 of 17\n\n\nMaryland and D.C.-located federal agencies, including the Social Security Administration and\n\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs.\n\n       18.     The Department of Labor has also seen a significant uptick of new\n\nUnemployment Insurance claims of ex-federal employees just in the last few weeks, with an\n\napproximate range of 30 to 60 new such claims every day.\n\n       19.     In light of these claims and public reporting about ongoing and forthcoming\n\nfederal layoffs, in order to comply with federal and state obligations, Departmental personnel\n\nhave contacted dozens of federal agencies and offices to seek information as to whether mass\n\nlayoffs are being conducted currently or are being planned in the future.\n\n       20.     The Division of Workforce Development and Adult Learning, the unit within the\n\nDepartment that administers the Rapid Response program, along with other statewide partners at\n\nthe county and municipal level, have not received any substantive response as to these agencies'\n\nplans for mass layoffs.\n\n       21.     Because the Department has received no notice of federal RIFs, despite extensive\n\noutreach, we are dedicating significantly more staff, resources, and expenditures to fulfill our\n\nstatutory obligation.\n\n       22.     Indeed, because we have not received the statutorily required advance notice of\n\nwhich agencies are planning to conduct mass layoffs, the Department has been forced to rely on\n\npublic reporting and word-of-mouth to conduct after-the-fact outreach to potentially affected\n\nworkers. Reacting after a layoff is far more resource-intensive than the advance planning and\n\nassistance process required by law.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 6\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 4-5        Filed 03/07/25       Page 8 of 17\n\n\n       23.       As referenced above, Department staff have conducted extensive affirmative\n\noutreach to federal agencies and offices to try and determine the location and extent of upcoming\n\nlayoffs.\n\n       24.       Moreover, the Department of Labor has had to devote significant additional staff\n\ntime from fiscal, communications, grant management, operational and administrative, and policy\n\nteams to conduct broad-based outreach to try and identify recently terminated employees, to\n\nattempt to provide relevant resources and services rapidly.\n\n       25.       While Rapid Response activities are generally funded through federal\n\nappropriations under WIOA Title I, the additional burden of responding and the related expenses\n\nhas required the Department to divert multiple staff from important state projects.\n\n       26.       For example, several individuals in the Department's Office of the Secretary and\n\nOffice of Administration have been diverted from working on state matters to handle the federal\n\nresponse. Such state matters that are being affected through the diversion of staff include\n\noccupational and professional licensing oversight, financial regulation, state\n\nworkforce development programs, and matters related to other non-federally funded activities of\n\nthe Maryland Department of Labor.\n\n           27.   In addition, other Department personnel have been diverted from state-funded\n\nworkforce development projects, including the Employment Advancement Right Now\n\n(\"EARN\") program, which is a Maryland's premiere workforce development grant initiative\n\nserving over 5,000 constituents annually.\n\n           28.   However, such staff have been instead dedicated to reacting to the latest layoff\n\nnews, trying to identify the affected federal agency and ex-employees, provide information, and\n\n\n\n\n                                                  7\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 4-5       Filed 03/07/25      Page 9 of 17\n\n\notherwise adjust procedures and resources to assist confused and unemployed Marylanders in a\n\ncomplicated and rapidly evolving environment.\n\n       29.     As just one example of these efforts, Department staff created a new website,\n\nrequiring significant time and expense, see Maryland Workers Impacted by Recent Federal\n\nActions, https://response.maryland.gov/federalpublicservants/. This effort was a further attempt\n\nto provide resources and services, which could normally be targeted at specific personnel\n\nimpacted in future layoff events, but must instead be provided less efficiently and at greater\n\nexpense to the entire public, because our personnel remain unaware of whether and when the\n\nnext federal mass layoff event will occur, and who has been impacted and is in need of support.\n\n       30.     In sum, every day that goes by, the Department is devoting significant time,\n\nresources, and expense to simply try and identify workers subject to federal mass layoffs,\n\nconduct mass outreach, and otherwise make resources available to potentially affected\n\nindividuals in new ways, all because federal agencies have failed to provide us the legally\n\nrequired notice of mass layoffs.\n\nUnemployment Assistance Process\n\n       31.     The Maryland Department of Labor also manages claims for unemployment\n\nbenefits by individuals formerly employed to work in Maryland.\n\n       32.     The Unemployment Compensation Law of Maryland (Title 8 of the Maryland\n\nCode, Labor and Employment Article in its entirety), enacted in 1936, provides insurance\n\nbenefits, over an extended period of time, to persons who become unemployed through no fault\n\nof their own. Md. Code Ann. Lab. & Empl. Art. \u00a78-102(d).\n\n        33.    As a general matter, the federal Government is required to reimburse Maryland\n\nfor unemployment benefits provided to former federal employees. Specifically, Maryland is\n\n\n\n                                                 8\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 4-5        Filed 03/07/25      Page 10 of 17\n\n\nparty to an agreement with the United States Secretary of Labor, wherein the Maryland\n\nDepartment of Labor pays, as an agent of the United States, Unemployment Compensation for\n\nFederal Employees (\"UCFE\") pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8502(a).\n\n       34.     Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8502(b), Maryland is reimbursed for UCFE payments to\n\nfederal employees in the same amount, on the same terms, and subject to the same conditions\n\nwhich would be payable to them under Maryland Unemployment Compensation Law.\n\n       35.     In addition, the Maryland Department of Labor administers its federal-state\n\ncooperative unemployment insurance program, financed in large part by grants from the federal\n\ngovernment pursuant to the Social Security Act. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 501-503.\n\n       36.     The Maryland Unemployment Insurance Compensation Program, certified by the\n\nU.S. Secretary of Labor under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7502(a), provides for payment of insurance benefits for\n\nup to twenty-six (26) weeks to persons who find themselves unemployed through no fault of\n\ntheir own. Md Code. Ann. Lab. & Empl. \u00a7\u00a7 8-201-223, 8-801, 8-808, 8-901-910, 1001-1009.\n\n       37.     While the federal Government provides grants for the purpose of administrating\n\nstate unemployment benefit programs, these grants are frequently less than the total\n\nadministrative costs incurred by Maryland. And that is the case now; the federal grant monies\n\nallocated to Maryland are not sufficient to adequately cover our unemployment benefit program\n\nadministration.\n\n       38.     In these circumstances, Maryland relies on its Special Administrative Expense\n\nFund (SAEF) when federal funding is insufficient. See Md. Code Ann., Labor & Employment\n\n\u00a7\u00a7 8-419 to 842. This fund may be comprised of previously transferred federal funds (in limited\n\ncircumstances), as well as monies collected by the state through fines, interest, and other\n\npenalties, and contributions by the state legislature. Id. \u00a7 8-421. Currently, SAEF is comprised\n\n\n\n                                                 9\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB            Document 4-5        Filed 03/07/25     Page 11 of 17\n\n\nentirely of state funds. Accordingly, any increase in administrative costs of our unemployment\n\nbenefits program will be covered at least in part by state funds.\n\n       39.       Pursuant to Md. Code Ann. Lab. & Empl. \u00a7 8-805(a), an individual in Maryland\n\nwho wishes to collect unemployment insurance benefits must file a claim in accordance with\n\nregulations adopted by the Maryland Secretary of Labor.\n\n       40.       Claimants file claims online using the Department's system to assert a claim\n\ninitially and to provide information to indicate the basis of the claim, the name of the claimant's\n\nprevious employer, the reason for her separation, work experience, and other relevant\n\ninformation. Md. Code Regs. \u00a7 09.32.02.05.\n\n       41.       The reason for termination alleged by the claimant is then transmitted to the\n\nclaimant's employer(s) for verification. The employer is then asked to furnish a report of the\n\nseparation from employment containing, inter alia, the reason for the employee's separation and\n\na report of wage history. Md. Code Ann. Lab. & Empl. \u00a7 8-627; see also Md. Code Regs.\n\n\u00a7 09.32.02.05.\n\n       42.       There are various reasons why a claimant may be ineligible for, or disqualified\n\nfrom, receiving benefits. As a baseline, to be eligible for unemployment benefits, the individual\n\nmust be unemployed. Md. Code. Ann. Lab. & Empl. \u00a7 8-801(a). A person is considered\n\nunemployed during any week they: (1) do not perform work for which wages are payable; or (2)\n\nwork less than full-time and earn wages less than their assigned weekly benefit amount. Md.\n\nCode. Ann. Lab. & Empl. \u00a7 8-801(b). However, a part-time worker is not considered\n\nunemployed if they are working all the hours they are available for. Md. Code. Ann. Lab. &\n\nEmpl. \u00a7 8-801(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                                  10\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 4-5        Filed 03/07/25      Page 12 of 17\n\n\n       43.     Additionally, a claimant is ineligible if they did not earn requisite wages within\n\nthe first four of the last five completed calendar quarters, or alternatively the four most recent\n\ncalendar quarters, before their claim is filed. Md. Code. Ann. Lab. & Empl. \u00a7\u00a7 8-101(b) and 8-\n\n802.\n\n       44.     Maryland law disqualifies some claimants from benefits depending on the\n\ncircumstances of their separation from employment. See Md. Code Ann. Lab. & Empl. \u00a7 8-\n\n1001, et seq. A claimant is disqualified if they quit their job without good cause directly related\n\nto employment conditions or employer actions. Md. Code Ann. Lab. & Empl. \u00a7 8-1001(a).\n\nOther disqualifying circumstances include, inter alia, termination for misconduct, aggravated\n\nmisconduct, and gross misconduct. Id.\n\n       45.     A claims examiner at the Maryland Department of Labor is charged with making\n\nan initial determination on the claim. Md. Code. Ann. Lab. & Empl. \u00a78-806(a)(1).\n\n       46.

The Department of Labor's latest data indicates that at least 813 former federal\n\nemployees have applied for unemployment benefits since January 21, 2025.\n\n       51.     As noted above, the number of UCFE claims has increased significantly in just\n\nthe last few weeks, starting on or around February 14, 2025.\n\n       52.     In fact, the amount of UCFE claims received by the Maryland Department of\n\nLabor since January 21, 2025, is significantly higher than past years. By way of example, from\n\nJanuary 21, 2024, to March 3, 2024, we received only 189 unemployment claims containing\n\nfederal wages in the claimant's base period.\n\n       53.     While not required to apply for unemployment benefits, multiple individuals have\n\nattached in their application their letter of employment termination from the federal government.\n\nSuch letters indicate that these individuals were probationary employees purportedly terminated\n\nfor cause.\n\n       54.     When an employer provides the initial report of separation to the Department, the\n\nemployer must indicate the reason for the separation, including whether the employee was fired\n\nfor cause, such as misconduct.\n\n       55.     Accordingly, if an employer states in its report of separation that an individual\n\nwas terminated because performance has not been adequate to justify further employment at the\n\n\n\n\n                                                12\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB            Document 4-5       Filed 03/07/25      Page 14 of 17\n\n\nAgency, the Maryland Department of Labor's procedures require that the claims examiner must\n\ninvestigate the reason for discharge.\n\n       56.     The Maryland Department of Labor is required to verify both wages and reason\n\nfor separation of employment from each federal agency by sending a request for wage and\n\nseparation information. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 609.6(e)(1), 609.21 through 609.25. While private\n\nemployers report wages each quarter for all employees into the Department's database, see Code\n\nMd. Regs. \u00a7 09.32.01.12, federal agencies are not required to regularly report active employee\n\nwages to the States.\n\n       57.     The same Department staff who handle regular unemployment claims also\n\nprocess and adjudicate UCFE claims. Redirecting staff from regular Unemployment Insurance\n\n(UI) claims to process and adjudicate Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees\n\n(UCFE) claims threatens to strain our resources - especially because the lack of notice denied the\n\nDepartment the opportunity to educate potential claimants on claims filing, certification of work\n\nsearch, and other matters. Lack of claimant awareness of program processes and requirements\n\nhas historically led claimants to compliance errors affecting their entitlement to benefits absent\n\nextensive work by Department staff to fix issues with their claims.\n\n       58.     This diversion of personnel will undoubtedly impede the timely processing of\n\nregular UI claims, creating significant backlogs and delays. The consequences will be far-\n\nreaching, affecting countless individuals who depend on swift resolutions to sustain their\n\nlivelihoods. By diverting resources, we compromise the efficiency and responsiveness of our\n\nclaims processing system, ultimately undermining public trust and exacerbating economic\n\nhardship.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 13\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 4-5       Filed 03/07/25      Page 15 of 17\n\n\n       59.     While the Department of Labor is only beginning to process these claims, our\n\nstaff has already begun the process of contacting relevant federal agencies to request information\n\non relevant terminations, to determine if they were in fact done for cause.\n\n       60.     Thus far, we have received at least 193 reports of separation from federal\n\nagencies, concerning their recently terminated employees.\n\n       61.     Several of the reports gave as a reason for termination only that there was a\n\n\"permanent lack of work due to a change in Presidential Administration.\"\n\n       62.     In addition, the Department received several reports from federal agencies\n\nexplicitly stating that the employees were \"laid off due to a reduction in force.\" Such reports\n\nwere received from multiple federal agencies not disclosed here out of an abundance of caution\n\nto preserve privacy.\n\n       63.     And, as relevant here, certain reports asserted that the employee at issue was\n\nterminated for cause, for instance due to \"unsatisfactory work performance\" and similar generic\n\nperformance-related bases.\n\n       64.     Similarly, other reports highlighted various potentially disqualifying\n\ncircumstances. For instance, agencies indicated that claimants might not be genuinely\n\nunemployed or had voluntarily resigned from their positions.\n\n       65.     These reports were received from multiple federal agencies not disclosed here out\n\nof an abundance of caution to preserve privacy.\n\n       66.     Yet at the same time, termination letters, as well as recent statements of the\n\nPresident and other federal officials, indicate that the overwhelming majority of recent federal\n\nterminations were not for-cause firings, based on individualized assessments of performance, but\n\n\n\n\n                                                  14\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 4-5        Filed 03/07/25      Page 16 of 17\n\n\ninstead constitute a Government-wide effort to shrink the size of the federal workforce, an\n\neffective reduction in force.\n\n       67.     Where federal agencies assert that certain individual federal employees were\n\nterminated for cause or are otherwise ineligible or disqualified from benefits, or where there is\n\ndisputed or conflicting information, our Department will be required to follow an intensive and\n\nmandatory investigative process for those unemployment claims.\n\n       68.     Department staff, due to regulatory requirements, must treat these separations as\n\npotential misconduct firings. This necessitates extensive investigations and fact-finding, leading\n\nto a considerable drain on resources and time, and adds delay to the benefit process.\n\n       69.     The procedures impose a significant strain on the Maryland Department of\n\nLabor's financial and temporal resources. Each case demanding interviews and/or a fact-finding\n\nproceeding necessitates extensive staff hours for scheduling, conducting interviews, reviewing\n\nevidence, and drafting detailed decisions. The need to send notices, accommodate witness\n\ntestimony, and facilitate cross-examination further escalates the time commitment. Moreover, the\n\npotential for subsequent appeals triggers a cascade of additional hearings and reviews, diverting\n\nresources from other essential departmental functions.\n\n        70.    Moreover, where federal agencies fail to provide responses to requests for\n\nseparation information, the onus is on the Department to gather necessary wage and separation\n\ninformation. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 609.6 (e)(2). This requires claims staff to solicit evidence from the\n\nclaimants in the form of pay stubs, W-2s and affidavits and to pay benefits based on that\n\ninformation. In fact, recent federal guidance regarding federal unemployment during recent\n\ngovernment shutdowns encourages states to have claimants file an affidavit, using available\n\nproof, given \"limited federal HR resources\" to respond to requests for separation information.\n\n\n\n                                                 15\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB             Document 4-5             Filed 03/07/25   Page 17 of 17\n\n\n\n\"Unemployment Insurance Program Letter 03-22,\" U.S. Department of Labor, November 2022,\n\nhttps://vvww.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/ETA/advisories/0IPL/2021/UIPL 03-22.pdf.\n\n        71.    Further, payment to large numbers of claimants without employer verification\n\nwas a direct cause of thousands of erroneous overpayments during the COVID-19 pandemic -\n\ncausing the Department to investigate, issue overpayment determinations, and litigate appeals.\n\n        72.     Additionally complicating matters, it has come to our attention that termination\n\nnotices issued by federal agencies were not issued in compliance with governing reduction in\n\nforce procedures. It is apparent that there are affected individuals, including veterans, who\n\nshould have been accorded preference under required RIF procedures but were not. To the\n\nextent that preferences and other requirements would have precluded termination, and federal\n\nemployees successfully challenge their separations, this will cause the Department to re-\n\nadjudicate claims, pursue overpayments, and conduct appeals.\n\n        73.    As noted above, because current federal appropriations are insufficient to fully\n\nsupport our unemployment benefits program, Maryland is already relying on state SAEF monies\n\nto cover the difference. Further administrative burdens and strain imposed by administrative\n\ninvestigations will therefore likely require additional state funds.\n\n       74.     The cumulative effect of these investigations translates to substantial expenditures\n\non personnel, administrative overhead, and the technological infrastructure required to manage\n\nthe burgeoning caseload, ultimately depleting the department's budget and hindering its ability to\n\naddress other critical labor-related issues.\n\n                                               Executed on March 6, 2025, at Annapolis, Maryland.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 PAirtia Y.

I am a resident of the State of Arizona. I am over the age of 18 and have personal\n\nknowledge of all the facts stated herein, except to those matters stated upon information and\n\nbelief; as to those matters, I believe them to be true. If called as a witness, I could and would\n\ntestify competently to the matters set forth below.\n\n       2.      I am currently employed by the Arizona Department of Economic Security\n\n(\u201cADES\u201d) as the Assistant Director, Division of Employment and Rehabilitation Services\n\n(\u201cDERS\u201d).\n\n       3.

For example, ADES manages claims for unemployment benefits by individuals\n\nformerly employed to work in Arizona.\n\n          5.   As Assistant Director, DERS, I can request and be given information about\n\nrecords relating to claims for unemployment benefits through the Unemployment Insurance (UI)\n\nprogram.\n\n          6.   Currently, those records show that in 2024, ADES received 234 regular UI initial\n\nclaims for benefits for which a federal employer was identified as the last employer during the\n\nmonths of January and February. In 2025, ADES received 286 regular UI initial claims for\n\nbenefits for which a federal employer was identified as the last employer during the same time\n\nperiod.\n\n          7.   ADES also is the state entity responsible for conducting outreach and providing\n\nunemployment services required by the federal Workforce Investment Act of 1998, as amended\n\nby the federal Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act of 2014. Specifically, ADES oversees\n\nArizona\u2019s Rapid Response program. See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 3174(A)(2)(i).\n\n          8.   Arizona\u2019s Rapid Response program is a Workforce Reduction Support service\n\nthat provides prompt layoff transition support and reemployment services to employers and\n\nemployees affected by workplace layoffs and closures in Arizona. Employers and affected\n\nemployees are supported through no-cost, customized services to help mitigate the effects of\n\nworkforce reduction.\n\n\n\n                                                2\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 4-6        Filed 03/07/25      Page 4 of 5\n\n\n\n       9.      I understand on information and belief that, under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d)(3)(A)(i),\n\nthe federal Government is required to notify \u201cthe State or entity designated by the State to carry\n\nout rapid response activities under section 134(a)(2)(A) of the Workforce Investment Act of\n\n1998\u201d of a plan for a reduction-in-force (RIF) of a significant number of federal employees,\n\ngenerally at least 60 days in advance of any proposed RIF.\n\n       10.     To the best of my knowledge ADES has not received notice from the federal\n\ngovernment of a RIF at any federal agency that would trigger the Arizona Rapid Response\n\nprogram.\n\n       11.     At this time, ADES does not know how many federal employees who may be\n\npermitted to file for unemployment benefits in Arizona have been terminated from their\n\nemployment since January 20, 2025.\n\n               Executed on March 5, 2025, in Maricopa County, Arizona.\n\n\n\n\n                                              /s/ Anna Hunter*\n                                              Anna Hunter, Assistant Director,\n                                              Division of Employment and Rehabilitation\n                                              Services, Arizona Department of Economic\n                                              Security\n\n                                              *A copy of the signature page bearing an\n                                              original signature is attached hereto.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 3\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB   Document 4-6   Filed 03/07/25   Page 5 of 5\n\f",

I am a resident of the State of Illinois. I am over the age of 18 and have personal\n\nknowledge of all the facts stated herein, except to those matters stated upon information and\n\nbelief; as to those matters, I believe them to be true. If called as a witness, I could and would\n\ntestify competently to the matters set forth below.\n\n       2.      I am currently employed as the Deputy Director, Service Delivery of the Illinois\n\nDepartment of Employment Security (\u201cIDES\u201d).\n\n\n\n\n                                                  1\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 4-8        Filed 03/07/25       Page 3 of 9\n\n\n\n       3.      IDES is the department of the Illinois state government that administers state\n\nunemployment insurance benefits, runs the employment service and Illinois labor exchange\n\nsystem, and publishes labor market information.\n\n       4.      As IDES Deputy Director, Service Delivery, I have access to comprehensive\n\nreports and financial records that detail the State of Illinois\u2019 labor market, including claims for\n\nunemployment insurance benefits, and the allocation and distribution of federal funding received\n\nby IDES. Additionally, my role includes overseeing the implementation of and compliance with\n\nfederally funded programs within the agency, ensuring expenditures align with federal guidelines\n\nand regulations.\n\n       5.      The ongoing mass-layoff of federal workers is irreparably harming the State of\n\nIllinois in several ways.\n\nUnemployment Assistance Process\n\n       6.      IDES manages claims for unemployment insurance benefits by individuals\n\nformerly employed to work in the State of Illinois.\n\n       7.      The Illinois Unemployment Insurance Act (\u201cUI Act\u201d), 820 ILCS 405/100, et seq.,\n\nprovides unemployment insurance benefits, over an extended period of time, to persons who\n\nbecome unemployed through no fault of their own and meet eligibility requirements. Benefits are\n\nfunded through contributions made by Illinois employers to the Illinois Unemployment\n\nInsurance Trust Fund (\u201cTrust Fund\u201d). Id.\n\n       8.      As a general matter, the federal government is required to pay for unemployment\n\ninsurance benefits provided to former federal employees. Specifically, the State of Illinois is\n\nparty to an agreement with the United States Secretary of Labor, under which the Secretary shall\n\n\n\n\n                                                  2\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 4-8        Filed 03/07/25      Page 4 of 9\n\n\n\npay, as an agent of the United States, Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees\n\n(\u201cUCFE\u201d) pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8502(a).\n\n       9.      Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8502(b), UCFE payments to federal employees are to be\n\nmade in the same amount, on the same terms, and subject to the same conditions as would apply\n\nto them under the UI Act.\n\n       10.     For unemployment insurance claims in general, an individual who wishes to\n\ncollect benefits in Illinois must file a claim in accordance with the requirements of the UI Act\n\nand 56 Ill. Admin Code \u00a7 2712 through \u00a7 2920, generally. See 820 ILCS 405/700. Claimants\n\nmay file claims online using the IDES system to initiate a claim and to provide information\n\nindicating the basis of the claim, the name of the claimant\u2019s previous employer, the reason for\n\nthe job separation, work experience, and other relevant information. Notice of the claim is then\n\ntransmitted to the claimant\u2019s former employer(s) for a response. The employer is asked to furnish\n\ninformation about the separation from employment and other information the employer wishes to\n\nprovide.\n\n       11.     Illinois law disqualifies some claimants from unemployment insurance benefits\n\ndepending on the circumstances of their separation from employment. Disqualifying\n\ncircumstances include, inter alia, discharge for misconduct and voluntary leaving, as defined by\n\nthe UI Act. See 820 ILCS 405/601 and 602.\n\n       12.     If an eligibility determination involves a resolution of a dispute of material fact,\n\nthe claims adjudicator must conduct a predetermination fact-finding interview(s) after notice is\n\nprovided to the employee and her employer(s). 820 ILCS 405/702; 56 Ill. Admin Code\n\n\u00a7 2720.135. Thereafter, a written initial determination must be made stating, inter alia, the\n\nweekly benefit amount, maximum benefits payable to the claimant in a benefit year, and the\n\n\n\n                                                 3\n\f          Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB       Document 4-8        Filed 03/07/25      Page 5 of 9\n\n\n\nreasons for the determination. 820 ILCS 405/702. That determination must be delivered to the\n\nclaimant and the employer \u201cpromptly.\u201d Id. If the initial determination is favorable to the\n\nclaimant, payments must begin \u201cpromptly.\u201d 820 ILCS 405/706.\n\n          13.   A claimant or an employer may file an administrative appeal, generally within 30\n\ndays. 820 ILCS 405/800.\n\n          14.   The unemployment insurance benefit amount a specific individual receives is\n\ngenerally based on their prior wages. Illinois businesses are required to report wages to the\n\nDepartment on a monthly and/or quarterly basis. 820 ILCS 405/1402. However, the federal\n\ngovernment is not required to and does not report wages to the Department. As a result, for each\n\nclaim that is filed by a former federal employee, staff must manually process the claim in order\n\nfor the appropriate federal agency or agencies that employed the claimant to send the wage\n\nreport to IDES.\n\nUnemployment Benefits Recent Experience and Investigatory Process\n\n          15.   IDES\u2019 data indicates that approximately 446 claims for unemployment insurance\n\nbenefits have been filed by former federal employees in Illinois between January 19, 2025 and\n\nMarch 1, 2025 where the last date worked was after January 18, 2025.\n\n          16.   During the entire calendar year of 2024, IDES data indicates that approximately\n\n453 claims were filed by former federal employees for unemployment insurance benefits.\n\n          17.   Each claim filed by a federal employee requires manual processing to obtain the\n\nwage records for that employee, work that is not required in regular unemployment insurance\n\nclaims.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 4\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 4-8        Filed 03/07/25      Page 6 of 9\n\n\n\n       18.     In addition, when an employer responds to a notice of claim to IDES, the\n\nemployer indicates the reason for the separation, including whether the employee was discharged\n\nfor cause, such as misconduct.\n\n       19.     If an employer indicates in its response that an individual was separated due to\n\nperformance issues, unspecified discharge, or voluntarily leaving, IDES procedures require that\n\nthe claims adjudicator investigate the reason for separation.\n\n       20.     Between February 2, 2025, and February 28, 2025, a substantial number of the\n\nresponses from federal employers have indicated a performance issue, unspecified discharge, or\n\nvoluntarily leaving.\n\n       21.     As soon as we receive such a response, the Department is required to follow our\n\nintensive and mandatory investigative process, in addition to seeking wages from the federal\n\nemploying agency as stated above. And while designed to ensure fairness, the procedures impose\n\na significant strain on IDES\u2019 financial and temporal resources. Each case requiring a fact-finding\n\nproceeding necessitates extensive staff hours for scheduling, conducting interviews, reviewing\n\nevidence, and drafting detailed decisions. The need to send notices and accommodate witness\n\ntestimony further escalates the time commitment. Moreover, the potential for subsequent appeals\n\ntriggers a cascade of additional hearings and reviews. All of these activities divert resources\n\nfrom other essential departmental functions.\n\n       22.     The same IDES staff who handle regular unemployment insurance claims also\n\nprocess and adjudicate UCFE claims.\n\n       23.     The cumulative effect of these increased claims by federal workers and increased\n\ninvestigations is translating into substantial expenditures on personnel, administrative overhead,\n\nand the technological infrastructure required to manage the burgeoning caseload, ultimately\n\n\n\n                                                 5\n\f          Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB        Document 4-8        Filed 03/07/25     Page 7 of 9\n\n\n\ndepleting the department\u2019s budget and hindering its ability to address other critical labor-related\n\nissues.\n\n          24.   As the trends noted above continue, the diversion of personnel to handle UCFE\n\nclaims will impede the timely processing of regular unemployment insurance claims, creating\n\nbacklogs and delays. The consequences will be far-reaching, affecting countless individuals who\n\ndepend on swift resolutions to sustain their livelihoods. By diverting resources, we compromise\n\nthe efficiency and responsiveness of our claims processing system, ultimately exacerbating\n\neconomic hardship for Illinoisans and undermining public trust.\n\n          25.   Statements by the President and other federal officials have indicated that the\n\noverwhelming majority of recent federal terminations were not for-cause firings, based on\n\nindividualized assessments of performance, but instead constitute a government-wide effort to\n\nshrink the size of the federal workforce; effectively, a reduction in force.\n\n          26.   As a result, IDES anticipates that the overwhelming majority of recently-\n\nterminated federal employees will be eligible for state unemployment benefits because they were\n\nnot terminated for cause and lost their jobs through no fault of their own.\n\n          27.   However, the federal government\u2019s pretextual claims that terminations are for-\n\ncause or voluntary leaving will necessitate extensive and unrecoverable expenditures of\n\nresources by IDES.\n\nExpenditures Due to Federal Firings\n\n          28.   IDES has another statutory mission to: reduce reliance on public benefit systems\n\nsuch as unemployment insurance benefits; promote economic recovery and vitality by\n\ndeveloping an ongoing, comprehensive approach to identify, plan for, and respond to layoffs and\n\ndislocations; and prevent or minimize the impact of mass layoffs on workers, businesses, and\n\n\n\n                                                  6\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 4-8       Filed 03/07/25      Page 8 of 9\n\n\n\ncommunities. In direct and sole response to the federal firings and the increase in claims filed by\n\nformer federal employees, IDES is expending increased resources to fulfill this responsibility.\n\n       29.     To the best of IDES\u2019 knowledge, there has never been advance notice of which\n\nfederal agencies are planning to conduct mass layoffs, or when. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d)(3)(A).\n\nAccordingly, we have been forced to rely on public reporting and word-of-mouth to conduct\n\nafter-the-fact outreach to potentially affected workers.\n\n       30.     Due to the increase in claims for UCFE benefits, and due to public reporting\n\nabout ongoing and forthcoming federal layoffs, IDES staff around the entire State of Illinois\n\nwere engaged to: develop a rapid plan of action; set up a specialized force of claims adjudicators\n\nand other staff to address and investigate the increased UCFE claims; create direct IVR call\n\ncenter queues for UCFE claimants; develop communications to federal employee claimants\n\nbased on the unique circumstances of this mass firing; develop and present virtual weekly\n\nworkshops for this distinctive group of individuals; and coordinate with other Illinois agencies to\n\nmeet the specialized needs of these individuals.\n\n       31.     Instead of performing their normal duties, staff have instead been dedicated to\n\nreacting to the latest layoff news, trying to identify affected federal agencies and ex-employees,\n\nprovide information, and otherwise adjust procedures and resources to assist confused and\n\nunemployed workers in Illinois in a complicated and rapidly evolving environment.\n\n       32.     As just one example of these efforts, Department staff created a new webpage,\n\nrequiring significant time and expense. See https://ides.illinois.gov/unemployment/deferred-\n\nresignation-of-federal-employees.html. This effort was a further attempt to provide resources and\n\nservices, which could normally be targeted at specific personnel impacted in future layoff events\n\nbut must instead be provided less efficiently and at greater expense to the entire public, because\n\n\n\n                                                   7\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB   Document 4-8   Filed 03/07/25   Page 9 of 9\n\f",

I am currently employed by the Executive Office of Labor and Workforce\n\nDevelopment (EOLWD) as Undersecretary and Chief Operating Officer.\n\n       3.      EOLWD works to support the Commonwealth's workforce by making available\n\nnew opportunities and training, protecting the rights of workers, preventing workplace injuries\n\nand illnesses, providing temporary assistance when employment is interrupted, promoting labor-\n\nmanagement partnerships and ensuring equal access to economic self-sufficiency and\n\nopportunity for all citizens of the Commonwealth. In addition, EOLWD is the secretariat\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB         Document 4-9       Filed 03/07/25      Page 3 of 12\n\n\n\n\ncomprising the Department of Unemployment Assistance (DUA), MassHire Department of\n\nCareer Services (MDCS), Department of Economic Research (DER), Department of Family and\n\nMedical Leave (DFML), Department of Industrial Accidents, Department of Labor Standards,\n\nDepartment of Labor Relations, and Department of Apprentice Standards. DUA administers the\n\nCommonwealth\u2019s unemployment insurance (\u201cUI\u201d) program, MDCS oversees the state\u2019s career\n\ncenters and related services, and DER supports economic research efforts\u2014including Labor\n\nMarket Information (LMI).\n\n       4.      As Undersecretary/Chief Operating Officer, I oversee the DUA. As a result, I\n\nhave access to comprehensive reports and records that detail the Commonwealth\u2019s LMI,\n\nincluding aggregate data regarding unemployment insurance claims. Additionally, my role\n\nincludes oversight of the DFML, EOLWD\u2019s Information Technology (IT) systems, audit and\n\ncompliance management, and other operations. I work collaboratively with EOLWD\u2019s\n\ndepartments, including the finance department, which disburses UI benefits on behalf of the\n\nDUA.\n\n       5.      The ongoing mass-layoff of federal workers is irreparably harming Massachusetts\n\nin several ways.\n\nRapid Response Team Expenditures\n\n       6.      In Massachusetts, services are provided to workers, jobseekers, and\n\nunemployment insurance claimants in accordance with federal and state laws and requirements,\n\nincluding the federal Workforce Investment Act of 1998, as amended by the federal Workforce\n\nInnovation and Opportunity Act of 2014. A state rapid response program is required by the\n\nfederal Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 3174(A)(2)(i).\n\n\n\n\n                                               2\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB            Document 4-9       Filed 03/07/25      Page 4 of 12\n\n\n\n\n        7.       The MDCS oversees Massachusetts\u2019s network of Career Centers and provides\n\ncareer services and training opportunities across the state. This includes aiding businesses in\n\nfinding qualified talent, offering career services and referrals to jobseekers, and overseeing the\n\nstate\u2019s Rapid Response program.\n\n        8.       At its core, Rapid Response is an early intervention service provided at no cost to\n\nbusinesses and employees experiencing layoffs, downturns, or growth challenges in\n\nMassachusetts.\n\n        9.       As relevant here, when a private employer with more than 100 employees\n\ncontemplates a mass layoff, terminating 50 or more employees, the federal Worker Adjustment\n\nand Retraining Notification (WARN) Act imposes critical notice requirements. Specifically, the\n\nemployer is required to notify certain groups, including State dislocated worker units, at least\n\nsixty days in advance of the layoffs, so that rapid response activities can be undertaken to\n\nameliorate the negative effects of large unemployment events. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2101 et seq.\n\n        10.      The purpose of Rapid Response is to reduce reliance on public benefit systems\n\nsuch as unemployment insurance; promote economic recovery and vitality by developing an\n\nongoing, comprehensive approach to identify, plan for, and respond to layoffs and dislocations;\n\nand prevent or minimize the impact of mass layoffs on workers, businesses, and communities.\n\n        11.    When notified of a forthcoming mass layoff, the Rapid Response team quickly\n\nmobilizes to provide informational resources and reemployment services for workers, including\n\nbut not limited to: information and support for filing UI claims, information on the impacts of\n\nlayoffs on health coverage or other benefits, information on and referral to career services,\n\nreemployment-focused workshops and services, and referrals to occupational training.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  3\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 4-9        Filed 03/07/25      Page 5 of 12\n\n\n\n\n        12.     In addition, the Rapid Response team will contact affected businesses to collect,\n\nverify, and distribute pertinent information. Rapid Response will coordinate with state and local\n\nworkforce area staff at the American Job Centers, also called MassHire Career Centers, located\n\nacross the state.\n\n        13.     The Rapid Response team also facilitates connections to partner agencies and\n\norganizations to ensure that terminated workers and their families can continue to access\n\nresources such as home heating assistance, legal aid, and financial advice.\n\n        14.     I understand that, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d)(3)(A)(i), the federal government\n\nis similarly required to notify Massachusetts, or \u201cthe State or entity designated by the State to\n\ncany out rapid response activities under section 134(a)(2)(A) of the Workforce Investment Act\n\nof 1998\u201d of a plan for a reduction-in-force (RIF) of federal employees, generally at least 60 days\n\nin advance of any proposed RIF.\n\n        15.     To the best of my knowledge, neither EOLWD, including its constituent agencies,\n\nnor any other entity in the Massachusetts state government has yet received a notice of a federal\n\nreduction in force at any federal agency.\n\n        16.     Yet, as detailed further below, Massachusetts has already received approximately\n\n251 claims from terminated federal employees for unemployment benefits in Februaiy of 2025.\n\n        17.     DUA has also seen a significant uptick of new unemployment claims from ex-\n\nfederal employees just in the last few weeks, with 32 claims filed on February 24 alone. DUA is\n\nseeing and expects to continue seeing new claims filed every day.\n\n       18.     Due to these increasing claims for unemployment benefits, and due to public\n\nreporting about ongoing and forthcoming federal layoffs, our Rapid Response team personnel\n\nhave proactively contacted dozens of federal agencies and offices to ensure accurate information\n\n\n\n                                                 4\n\f        Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 4-9        Filed 03/07/25       Page 6 of 12\n\n\n\n\nis being provided and to seek information as to whether mass layoffs are being conducted\n\ncurrently or are being planned in the future. Similarly, the MDCS Rapid Response team has\n\nbeen fielding calls and meeting requests from concerned federal agencies, their representatives,\n\nand others. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, U.S. Department of Labor, the\n\nU.S. Department of the Interior, the U.S. Department of Treasury, the U.S. Department of\n\nVeterans Affairs, and others, all of whom have a significant presence in Massachusetts, have\n\nraised concerns regarding layoffs.\n\n        19.     The Rapid Response team has not received any substantive information as to\n\nthese federal agencies\u2019 plans for mass layoffs.\n\n        20.     Because our Rapid Response team has received no notice of federal RIFs, despite\n\nextensive outreach, EOLWD has been required to dedicate significantly more staff, resources,\n\nand expenditures to fulfill its statutory mission.\n\n        21.     Indeed, because EOLWD and its constituent agencies have not received advance\n\nnotice of which agencies are planning to conduct mass layoffs, we have been forced to rely on\n\npublic reporting and word-of-mouth to conduct after-the-fact outreach to potentially impacted\n\nindividuals. Reacting after a layoff is far more resource-intensive than the advance planning and\n\nassistance process required by law.\n\n       22.     This approach has ensured that those impacted by the layoffs have access to\n\ncrucial information and assistance. However, the extensive work required to implement these\n\ninitiatives has strained the departments' resources, while still trying to maintain effective levels\n\nof support in the face of ongoing challenges.\n\n\n\n\n                                                     5\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 4-9        Filed 03/07/25      Page 7 of 12\n\n\n\n\n           23.   For instance, as referenced above, staff have conducted extensive proactive\n\noutreach to federal agencies and offices to try to determine the location and extent of upcoming\n\nlayoffs.\n\n           24.   Moreover, EOLWD and its constituent agencies have had to devote significant\n\nadditional staff time from communications, policy, and legal staff to field questions from\n\nconcerned stakeholders and legislators, conduct broad-based outreach to try and identify\n\nrecently-terminated employees, and provide relevant resources and services.\n\n           25.   Under normal circumstances, such personnel are engaged in creating guidance for\n\nstakeholders and general media strategy around connecting Massachusetts residents to jobs,\n\ngrowing apprenticeship programs, program and grant administration, and other efforts to help\n\ngrow and support Massachusetts employers, workers, jobseekers, and more broadly the\n\nMassachusetts economy.\n\n       26.       However, such staff have instead been dedicated to reacting to the latest layoff\n\nnews, developing resource guides and fact sheets, trying to identify affected federal agencies and\n\nex-employees, provide information, and otherwise adjust procedures and resources to assist\n\nconfused and recently unemployed Massachusetts residents in a complicated and rapidly\n\nevolving environment.\n\n       27.       Since February 3, 2025, this has included reallocation of work for approximately\n\nseven MDCS staff members on the Rapid Response team. Specifically, this has meant diverting\n\nstaff from other important work for a combined total of at least 25 to 30 hours per week over the\n\nlast five weeks. This level of effort is expected to continue\u2014if not increase\u2014across the Rapid\n\nResponse team. Services provided to affected federal employees by the Rapid Response team so\n\nfar in 2025 have included but are not limited to: resume support; one-on-one meetings and career\n\n\n\n                                                  6\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 4-9       Filed 03/07/25      Page 8 of 12\n\n\n\n\ncounseling; providing information regarding use of LMI and how it can be useful in job search;\n\nand providing information about available resources, including MDCS Career Center services,\n\nand referrals to other internal and external resources.\n\n        28.     In addition to the Rapid Response team staff time already being dedicated to\n\nthese efforts, if work continues at this pace, MDCS staff not currently on the Rapid Response\n\nteam will be diverted from other critical career services programs.\n\n        29.    The Rapid Response team is also responsible for processing WARN notices for\n\nMassachusetts companies affected by layoffs.\n\n        30.    Other EOLWD and MDCS resources have been supporting Rapid Response\n\nefforts, but if federal layoffs continue at their current pace, MDCS resources will need to be\n\ncross-trained to support increased Rapid Response programming, diverting staff from other\n\ncritical career services programs across the state.\n\nUnemployment Assistance Process\n\n       31.     The Massachusetts unemployment insurance program, which is certified by the\n\nU.S. Secretary of Labor under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 502(a) and administered by the Massachusetts\n\nDepartment of Unemployment Assistance, provides for payment of UI benefits for eligible\n\nclaimants in Massachusetts. Specifically, DUA provides temporary payments for up to twenty-\n\nsix weeks to eligible workers who lose their job through no fault of their own, are able and\n\navailable to work, and actively searching for a job while receiving benefits. Such benefits are\n\nadministered pursuant to Chapter 151A of the Massachusetts General Laws.\n\n       32.     As a general matter, the federal government is required to reimburse\n\nMassachusetts for unemployment benefits provided to former federal employees. Specifically,\n\nMassachusetts is party to an agreement with the U.S. Secretary of Labor, wherein the Secretary\n\n\n\n                                                  7\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB            Document 4-9       Filed 03/07/25      Page 9 of 12\n\n\n\n\nshall pay, as an agent of the United States, Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees\n\n(\u201cUCFE\u201d) pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8502(a).\n\n       33.       Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8502(b), Massachusetts is reimbursed for UCFE payments\n\nto federal employees in the same amount, on the same terms, and subject to the same conditions\n\nwhich would be payable to them under Chapter 151A of the Massachusetts General Laws.\n\n       34.       In addition, DUA administers its federal-state cooperative unemployment\n\ninsurance program financed in large part by federal administrative grants pursuant to the Social\n\nSecurity Act. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 501-503.\n\n       35.       An individual in Massachusetts who wishes to collect UI benefits must file a\n\nclaim in accordance with DUA\u2019s statutory and regulatory requirements.\n\n       36.       Claimants file claims using DUA\u2019s online UI system to establish a claim initially\n\nand to provide information to indicate the basis of the claim, the reason for separation from\n\nemployment, the name of the employer, work experience, and other relevant information. G.L.\n\nc. 151A, \u00a7 38.\n\n       37.       The reason for termination alleged by the claimant is transmitted to the claimant\u2019s\n\nemployer for verification. The employer is asked to furnish a report of the separation from\n\nemployment containing, inter alia, the reason for the employee\u2019s separation and a report of wage\n\nhistory. G.L. c. 151 A, \u00a7\u00a7 38, 38A.\n\n       38.       Massachusetts law disqualifies some claimants from benefits depending on the\n\ncircumstances of their separation from employment or their failure to comply with state\n\nrequirements, for example, to continue to seek suitable employment while collecting\n\nunemployment insurance benefits. See G.L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 25. In addition to failing to comply with\n\n\n\n\n                                                  8\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 4-9        Filed 03/07/25          Page 10 of 12\n\n\n\n\ntechnical filing and registration requirements, disqualifying circumstances include termination\n\nfor deliberate misconduct in willful disregard of the employer\u2019s interest. Id.\n\n        39.      DUA adjudicators are charged with making initial determinations on claims. G.L.\n\nc. 151A, \u00a7 39.\n\n        40.      A claimant or an employer who disputes a determination on a UI claim may file\n\nan appeal within ten calendar days of notification. Following such an appeal, a hearing is held\n\nby a DUA review examiner. For a second level of review, appeals may be made to the Board of\n\nReview within thirty days of the mailing of a hearing decision. The three-member Board of\n\nReview is administered independently of the DUA and has the authority to uphold, reverse, or\n\nmodify, a review examiner\u2019s decision. Parties may appeal decisions by the Board of Review to a\n\nMassachusetts District Court or Boston Municipal Court within thirty days of the mailing of the\n\nBoard\u2019s decision. G.L. c. 151 A.\n\nUnemployment Benefits Recent Experience and Investigatory Process\n\n       41.       EOLWD\u2019s latest data indicates that 251 former federal employees have applied\n\nfor unemployment benefits since January 21, 2025.\n\n       42.       This data also shows that 86 of these individuals were formerly employed by the\n\nU.S. Department of Treasury, 26 by the U.S. Department of the Interior, 22 by the U.S.\n\nDepartment of Transportation, 21 by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and 18 by the U.S.\n\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs. To-date, in February alone, former employees from thirty-five\n\nfederal agencies or entities have filed to collect UI benefits in Massachusetts.\n\n       43.       The number of UCFE claims in Massachusetts has increased significantly,\n\nbeginning on or around February 9, 2025.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 9\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB            Document 4-9        Filed 03/07/25     Page 11 of 12\n\n\n\n\n        44.     In fact, the number of federal unemployment claims and inquiries received by the\n\nDUA in February of 2025 is significantly higher than past years.\n\n        45.     By way of example, in February 2024, DUA received 58 total federal UI claims.\n\nSo far, in February 2025, DUA has received 251. The total volume of claims for February 2025\n\nis expected to be higher still because eligible claimants can still file UI claims with a separation\n\ndate in February.\n\n        46.     Claimants must indicate the reason for their separation from employment in their\n\nUI applications. In Massachusetts, many recently separated federal workers are reporting either\n\nlack of work (due to a reorganization or restructure) or discharge for job performance (if\n\nperformance is cited in the dismissal as the reason for separation). Under Massachusetts law,\n\npoor job performance alone does not automatically disqualify someone from benefits. See G. L.\n\nc. 151A, \u00a7 25(e)(2).\n\n        47.     When an employer replies to DUA fact-finding with information related to a\n\nseparation, the employer is asked to provide the reason for the separation, including whether the\n\nemployee was fired for cause, such as deliberate misconduct in willful disregard of the\n\nemployer\u2019s interest.\n\n        48.     Every eligibility determination at the DUA is made on a case-by-case basis.\n\nWhen there is a dispute of material fact between the employer and the claimant, such as whether\n\na termination was for cause, an adjudicator sends a written notice notifying the parties of fact-\n\nfinding and conducting a proceeding in which the parties can offer evidence. Thereafter, the\n\nadjudicator drafts a written decision and delivers it to the parties.\n\n        49.     Each case demanding a fact-finding proceeding necessitates extensive staff hours\n\nfor scheduling, conducting interviews, reviewing evidence, and drafting detailed decisions. The\n\n\n\n                                                  10\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 4-9        Filed 03/07/25     Page 12 of 12\n\n\n\n\nneed to send notices, accommodate witness testimony, and facilitate cross-examination further\n\nescalates the time commitment.\n\n        50.    The cumulative effect translates to substantial expenditures on personnel,\n\nadministrative overhead, and technological infrastructure, at a time when DUA is preparing to\n\nlaunch a new online unemployment system.\n\n        51.    From that point, either party may initiate the administrative appeals process\n\ndescribed above.\n\n       52.     Recent statements of the President and other federal officials have indicated that\n\nthe overwhelming majority of recent federal terminations were not for-cause firings, based on\n\nindividualized assessments of performance, but instead constitute a government-wide effort to\n\nshrink the size of the federal workforce, an effective reduction in force.\n\n       53.     As a result, it is likely that the overwhelming majority of recently-terminated\n\nfederal employees will in fact be eligible for state unemployment benefits, because they were not\n\nterminated for cause.\n\n       54.     However, the federal government\u2019s claim that such terminations are for-cause will\n\nnecessitate extensive investigatory costs and resource expenditures by EOLWD.\n\n\n\n               Executed on March 5, 2025, at Boston, Massachusetts.\n\n\n\n\n                                                aolo Franzese, Esq.\n                                              Pa<\n                                                ndersecretary & Chief Operating Officer\n\n\n\n\n                                                 11\n\f",

Background\n\n       1.      I am the Secretary for the Massachusetts Executive Office of Health and Human\n\nServices (\"EOHHS\"). I have held this position since March 1, 2023. As the Secretary ofEOHHS,\n\nI oversee 11 state agencies, which include the Department of Public Health (\"DPH\") and the\n\nDepartment of Transitional Assistance (\"OTA\"). EOHHS also serves as the single state agency\n\nresponsible for the administration of the Medicaid program and the State Children's Health\n\nInsurance Program within Massachusetts (collectively, \"MassHealth\") and other health and human\n\nservices programs designed to pay for medical services for eligible individuals pursuant to M.G.L.\n\nc. 118E, Title XIX of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. sec. 1396 et seq.), Title XXI of the Social\n\nSecurity Act (42 U.S.C. sec. 1397aa et seq.), and other applicable laws and waivers. Our Secretariat\n\nhas an annual operating budget of approximately $30 billion and touches one out of every three\n\nresidents of the Commonwealth.\n\n       2.      I hold a Bachelor of Arts degree and a Master's degree in public health from Yale\n\nUniversity. Before joining the Healey-Driscoll Administration I served as the President and Chief\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB              Document 4-10   Filed 03/07/25    Page 3 of 7\n\n\n\n\nOperating Officer of Boston Medical Center (\"BMC\") for approximately 13 years. BMC is a\n\nprivate, not-for-profit 496-bed academic medical center in Boston. BMC health system has\n\napproximately 10,000 employees, 1,200 physicians, owns and operates Wellsense Insurance plan\n\nwhich provides access to health care to 600,000 people across Massachusetts and New Hampshire\n\nand an annual operating budget of roughly $6 billion. Prior to my appointment at BMC, I served\n\nas Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of Brigham and Women's Hospital for\n\nfive years.\n\n        3.      As EOHHS Secretary, I have personal knowledge of the rules, regulations, and\n\nprocesses governing EOHHS and its agencies. I have personal knowledge, or knowledge based on\n\nreview in my capacity as Secretary of information and records gathered by EOHHS and agency\n\nstaff, of the matters set forth below.\n\nI.      The Department of Public Health\n\n        4.      DPH promotes and protects health and wellness and prevents injury and illness for\n\n7 million residents of our Commonwealth. DPH prevents illness and disease, gives children a\n\nhealthy start, and makes sure food and water supplies are safe. They prepare for and respond to a\n\nwide range of emergencies and disasters, and they maintain vital records and collect important\n\nhealth-recorded data across the state. DPH also assesses the quality and safety of health care\n\nfacilities and services and oversees the integrity and competency of health care professions. DPH\n\nis the state agency responsible for overseeing the statewide system of prevention, intervention,\n\ntreatment, recovery and support services for individuals and families affected by substance\n\naddiction. In 2023, 2,125 people died as a result of an opioid related overdose in Massachusetts.\n\nOn or about February 28, the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services terminated the\n\nRegion I Regional Director effective immediately and without notice, leaving Massachusetts and\n\nall of New England without a federal regional coordinating body. This gap in staffing increases\n                                                 2\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB         Document 4-10          Filed 03/07/25   Page 4 of 7\n\n\n\n\nthe risk that harmful changes to drugs prone to abuse may not be timely identified as they travel\n\nthroughout New England. For example, in 2023, comprehensive communication with the\n\nRegional Director allowed programs throughout Massachusetts to understand and address the\n\npresence of a new adulterant, nitazene. Information received through public health partners in\n\nVermont and the Massachusetts Drug Supply Data Stream (\"MADDS\"), and managed by the\n\nRegional Director, enabled Massachusetts harm reduction providers to recognize clinical changes\n\nin presentation that could be attributed to nitazene and to respond accordingly. The sharing of this\n\ninformation allowed providers to collaborate and stay informed about changes in street drug supply\n\navailability, potency, and new drug-related health risks.\n\nII.    The Department of Transitional Assistance - SNAP\n\n       5.      The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (\"SNAP\") provides financial\n\nassistance to low-income individuals and families to help them buy food. Nearly 1.1 million people\n\nin Massachusetts receive SNAP benefits, one in six Massachusetts residents. There are SNAP\n\nrecipients in every city and town across the Commonwealth. Nearly 25% of SNAP recipients are\n\nolder adults (age 60 and older), 28% of SNAP recipients have a disability, and about one-third of\n\nSNAP recipients are children. SNAP eligibility is based on income and expenses. Most households\n\nmust have a gross monthly income at or below 200% of the Federal Poverty Level to qualify for\n\nSNAP in Massachusetts. In Massachusetts, the average SNAP benefit is $330 per household at the\n\nrate of$10.80 per household per day.\n\n       6.      OTA has been working with US Digital Services since February 2024 to develop\n\nand pilot a new technical Consent Based Verification app, which would improve and expand the\n\nability to collect and validate employment information for applying and existing SNAP\n\nhouseholds. Not only would the tool be implemented in Massachusetts, but it was also anticipated\n\n\n\n                                                 3\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB        Document 4-10        Filed 03/07/25     Page 5 of 7\n\n\n\n\nthat this service would ultimately be made available to all SNAP states, offering reduced\n\nadministrative costs for income verification to both states and the federal government. After a\n\nsuccessful phase one pilot in late 2024, Massachusetts and the USDS team broadened and\n\naccelerated the engagement in anticipation of a full-scale rollout of the technology in early spring\n\n2025. However, over recent weeks this engagement has been seriously disrupted by the\n\ntermination, loss, or relocation of USDS employees working on the project. As a result, the\n\nlikelihood of implementing CBV on time in Massachusetts has changed from expected to unlikely.\n\nIII.     MassHealth Programs\n\n        7.     EOHHS administers several publicly funded programs that enable qualifying\n\nMassachusetts residents to access free or low-cost healthcare coverage. These programs include\n\nthe Medicaid plan, Children's Health Insurance Program (\"CHIP\"), and the 1115 Demonstration\n\nProject-collectively known in Massachusetts as \"MassHealth.\" Jointly funded by state and\n\nfederal dollars, MassHealth provides coverage for a wide range of health services to children, the\n\nelderly, families, and individuals with disabilities. MassHealth benefits may vary depending on,\n\namong other things, a person's citizenship and immigration status and household income.\n\n        8.     Depending on household income, children who are U.S. citizens or who have\n\nqualifying immigration status are eligible for MassHealth's more comprehensive health benefits.\n\nFor example, children whose household income is no more than 200% of the federal poverty level\n\n(for children under 1) or 150% of the federal poverty level (for children 1 through 18) are eligible\n\nfor MassHealth Standard benefits. These MassHealth plans, which are funded in part by federal\n\ndollars, cover comprehensive medical and behavioral health care, primary and specialty physician\n\nservices, inpatient and outpatient hospital services, long-term services and supports,\n\ncomprehensive dental and vision care, lab tests, and pharmacy services.\n\n\n\n                                                 4\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 4-10       Filed 03/07/25      Page 6 of 7\n\n\n\n\n       9.      The majority of MassHealth's 2.3 million members receive their MassHealth\n\nservices through a managed care delivery system that MassHealth has implemented under federal\n\nregulations promulgated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\"CMS\") at 42 CFR\n\nPart 438. MassHealth's managed care programs include mandatory managed care programs for\n\nindividuals under the age of 65 for whom MassHealth is their primary insurer, as well as two\n\nvoluntary managed care programs for adults and seniors who have dual Medicare and Medicaid\n\nenrollment. As of February 2025, over 1.6 million members were enrolled in a MassHealth\n\nmanaged care program, which include managed care organizations (\"MCOs\"), primary care case\n\nmanagement entities (\"PCCM entities\"), a prepaid inpatient health plan (\"PIHP\"), and primary\n\ncare case managers (\"PCCMs\"), as defined under 42 CFR 438.2. These managed care programs,\n\nauthorized and regulated by CMS, are responsible for ensuring that their 1.6 million MassHealth\n\nenrollees have access to the benefits and entitlements guaranteed under federal law.\n\n       10.     In accordance with CMS regulations and subregulatory requirements, MassHealth\n\nsubmits documents related to its managed care programs to CMS for review and approval. The\n\nmanaged care documents required to be submitted to CMS for review and approval include\n\ncontracts and contract amendments, actuarially developed rate certifications, and state directed\n\npayment \"preprints.\" In calendar year 2024, MassHealth submitted 23 contract amendments, 18\n\nrate certifications or amended rate certifications, and 56 state directed payment preprints or\n\namended preprints for CMS review and approval. In order to gamer the requisite federal approvals\n\non these documents, MassHealth is also required to respond to CMS questions on these\n\ndocuments. In 2024, MassHealth submitted 5 sets of responses to CMS questions on our contract\n\namendments, 20 sets of responses to CMS questions on our rate certifications, and 32 sets of\n\nresponses to CMS questions on our state directed payment preprints. In all, the state submitted\n\n\n\n                                                5\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB   Document 4-10   Filed 03/07/25   Page 7 of 7\n\f",

Case No.: 1:25-cv-\n\n\nUNITED STATES DERPARTMENT OF\nAGRICULTURE; et al.,\n\n\n               Defendants.\n\n\n\n\n                    DECLARATION OF ROBERT ASARO-ANGELO\n\n     I, Robert Asaro-Angelo, declare as follows:\n\n           1. I am a resident of the State of New Jersey. I am over the age of 18. I am currently\n\n  the Commissioner of the New Jersey State Department of Labor and Workforce Development\n\n  (\u201cNJDOL\u201d).\n\n           2. I provide this declaration regarding certain facts based on my personal knowledge\n\n  and review of information provided to me by NJDOL personnel.\n\n           3. The mission of NJDOL is to protect New Jersey's workforce, strengthen its\n\n  businesses, and promote the dignity of work. NJDOL oversees New Jersey's three wage-\n\n  protection programs (Unemployment, Temporary Disability, and Family Leave Insurance),\n\n\n                                               1\n\f  Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 4-11       Filed 03/07/25      Page 3 of 11\n\n\n\nwhich provide cash benefits to workers who lose their jobs through no fault of their own, or\n\nare unable to work because they are sick or injured, caring for a family member, or bonding\n\nwith a new child. The NJDOL also oversees the Division of Disability Determination Services\n\nprogram, which helps individuals who are disabled and are unable to work apply for cash\n\nbenefits through the federal Social Security Program; oversees and operates the Division of\n\nWorkforce Development, which is responsible for New Jersey's workforce services, including\n\nvocational rehabilitation services, veterans\u2019 services, and more; and oversees the Division of\n\nEmployer Accounts, which helps employers throughout New Jersey maintain compliance with\n\nUnemployment and Disability Insurance laws. Additionally, NJDOL enforces the New Jersey\n\nPublic Employees Occupational Safety and Health Act as an Occupational Safety and Health\n\nAdministration State Plan.\n\n       4. As Commissioner, I have access to comprehensive reports and financial records\n\nthat detail the state of New Jersey\u2019s labor market, including claims for unemployment benefits,\n\nand the allocation and distribution of federal funding received by NJDOL. Additionally, my\n\nrole includes overseeing the implementation of, and compliance with, federally funded\n\nprograms within the agency, ensuring all expenditures align with federal guidelines and\n\nregulations.\n\n       5. The ongoing mass-layoff of federal workers is irreparably harming New Jersey in\n\nseveral ways.\n\n           Rapid Response Team Expenditures\n\n       6. NJDOL oversees the Rapid Response Program, a coordinated, multiple-partner\n\nstrategy to provide immediate assistance to New Jerseyans subject to mass layoffs. NJDOL is\n\nthe state entity responsible for conducting outreach and providing unemployment services\n\n\n\n                                            2\n\f  Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 4-11         Filed 03/07/25      Page 4 of 11\n\n\n\nrequired by the federal Workforce Investment Act of 1998, as amended by the federal\n\nWorkforce Innovation and Opportunity Act of 2014.\n\n       7. Specifically, a state rapid response program is required by both the federal\n\nWorkforce Innovation and Opportunity Act 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 3174(A)(2)(i) and N.J.S.A. 34:21-5.\n\n       8. When a private employer with more than 100 employees contemplates a mass\n\nlayoff, terminating 50 or more employees, the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining\n\nNotification (WARN) Act imposes critical notice requirements. Specifically, the employer is\n\nrequired to notify certain groups including State dislocated worker units, at least sixty days in\n\nadvance of the layoffs, so that rapid response activities can be undertaken to ameliorate the\n\nnegative effects of large unemployment events. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2101 et seq.\n\n       9. The purpose of the Rapid Response Program is to reduce reliance on public benefit\n\nsystems such as unemployment insurance; to promote economic recovery and vitality by\n\ndeveloping an ongoing, comprehensive approach to identify, plan for, and respond to layoffs\n\nand dislocations; and to prevent or minimize the impact of mass layoffs on workers, businesses,\n\nand communities.\n\n       10. When notified of a forthcoming mass layoff, the Rapid Response team will quickly\n\nprovide informational resources and reemployment services for workers, including but not\n\nlimited to: information and support for filing Unemployment Insurance (UI) claims,\n\ninformation on the impacts of layoffs on health coverage or other benefits, information on and\n\nreferral to career services, reemployment-focused workshops and services, and occupational\n\ntraining. The information is either presented virtually or on site at the discretion of the\n\nemployer.\n\n\n\n\n                                             3\n\f  Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 4-11         Filed 03/07/25       Page 5 of 11\n\n\n\n       11. I understand that, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d)(3)(A)(i), the federal Government\n\nis similarly required to notify \u201cthe State or entity designated by the State to carry out rapid\n\nresponse activities under section 134(a)(2)(A) of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998\u201d of a\n\nplan for a reduction-in-force (RIF) of federal employees, generally at least 60 days in advance\n\nof any proposed RIF.\n\n       12. My understanding is that the notice required by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d)(3)(A) is\n\nintended to trigger rapid response activities since it is explicitly to be given to the state entity\n\nrequired to carry out rapid response activities.\n\n       13. To the best of my knowledge, neither the NJDOL nor any other entity in the New\n\nJersey State Government have received notice of a federal reduction in force at any federal\n\nagency.\n\n       14. NJDOL\u2019s data indicates that 388 former federal employees, both probationary and\n\nnon-probationary, have applied for unemployment benefits from January 21, 2025, to February\n\n26, 2025. There was a material increase in the number of such claims beginning in mid-\n\nFebruary.\n\n       15. During the same period in 2024, only 104 federal unemployment claims were filed\n\nwith NJDOL. In the four months preceding the Executive Order, an average of 79 federal\n\nunemployment claims were filed each month.\n\n       16. Due to the lack of notice of these wide-scale federal employee firings, NJDOL\n\nwill have to devote a significant amount of time to conduct broad-based outreach to try to\n\nidentify recently terminated employees, and provide relevant resources and assistance in\n\nprocessing claims.\n\n\n\n\n                                               4\n\f  Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 4-11           Filed 03/07/25   Page 6 of 11\n\n\n\n       17. In addition, because of the lack of notice, NJDOL has been unable to plan in\n\nadvance to allocate more staff, resources, and expenditures as needed to fulfill our statutory\n\nmission and address the influx of claims.\n\n       18. In sum, my office needs to devote significant time, resources, and expense to simply\n\ntry to identify workers subject to federal mass layoffs and otherwise make resources available\n\nto potentially affected individuals in new ways, all because federal agencies have failed to\n\nprovide us the legally required notice of mass layoffs.\n\n              Unemployment Assistance Process\n\n       19. NJDOL also manages claims for unemployment benefits by individuals formerly\n\nemployed to work in New Jersey.\n\n       20. The Unemployment Compensation Law of New Jersey provides insurance\n\nbenefits, over an extended period of time, to persons who become unemployed through no fault\n\nof their own. N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 43:21-1\u201324.30.\n\n       21. As a general matter, the federal Government is required to reimburse New Jersey\n\nfor unemployment benefits provided to former federal employees. Specifically, the Division\n\nof Employment Security is party to an agreement with the United States Secretary of Labor,\n\nwherein the Secretary shall pay, as an agent of the United States, Unemployment\n\nCompensation for Federal Employees (\u201cUCFE\u201d) pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8502(a). N.J. Stat.\n\nAnn. \u00a7 43:21-5.2.\n\n       22. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8502(b), New Jersey is reimbursed for UCFE payments to\n\nfederal employees in the same amount, on the same terms, and subject to the same conditions\n\nwhich would be payable to them under the New Jersey Unemployment Compensation Law.\n\n\n\n\n                                             5\n\f  Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 4-11         Filed 03/07/25      Page 7 of 11\n\n\n\n       23. Pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 43:21-6, an individual in New Jersey who wishes to\n\ncollect unemployment insurance benefits must file a claim in accordance with regulations\n\nadopted by the Director of the Division of Unemployment and Temporary Disability Insurance\n\nof the Department of Labor and Workforce Development of the State of New Jersey.\n\n       24. Claimants file claims online or by phone using NJDOL\u2019s system to assert a claim\n\ninitially and to provide information to indicate the basis of the claim, the name of the claimant\u2019s\n\nprevious employer, the reason for her separation, work experience, and other relevant\n\ninformation. The claimant is then provided a notice from the Division informing them that the\n\nclaim is being processed as well as their expected monetary determination, if wage information\n\nis available to the Division.\n\n       25. The employer is then contacted and asked to furnish a report of the separation from\n\nemployment containing the reason for the employee\u2019s separation and, if not already available\n\nto the Division, a report of wage history. N.J. Admin. Code \u00a7 12:17-5.5; see also N.J. Admin.\n\nCode \u00a7 12:17-3.2.\n\n       26. New Jersey law disqualifies or delays some claimants from receiving benefits\n\ndepending on the circumstances of their separation from employment or other factors. See N.J.\n\nStat. Ann. \u00a7 43:21-5. Disqualifying or delaying circumstances include, inter alia, termination\n\nfor misconduct, which if confirmed after investigation by NJDOL results in a six-week waiting\n\nperiod before receiving benefits. Id., see also N.J. Admin. Code \u00a7\u00a7 12:17-10.1\u201310.8.\n\n       27. After a claimant has filed a claim, the claimant may be required to participate in\n\nfact-finding and electronic adjudication to determine eligibility for benefits. N.J. Admin. Code\n\n\u00a7 12:17-4.3(g). Thereafter, a benefit determination notice will be made stating, inter alia, the\n\n\n\n\n                                              6\n\f  Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 4-11        Filed 03/07/25      Page 8 of 11\n\n\n\ninformation used to determine monetary eligibility and if he or she is found ineligible or\n\ndisqualified for benefits. N.J. Admin. Code \u00a7 12:17-4.7.\n\n       28. A claimant may file an appeal within 21 days from the mailing date of the benefit\n\ndetermination notice. An employer may file for appeal within 7 days of confirmed receipt of\n\nnotification of an initial determination. N.J. Stat. Ann \u00a7 43:21-6(b)(1). An initial determination\n\nis final unless an appeal is filed, and such appeals may proceed through administrative and\n\nthen judicial review. N.J. Admin. Code \u00a7\u00a7 1:12-1\u201318.5.\n\n           Unemployment Benefits Recent Experience and Investigatory Process\n\n       29. As noted above, there has been a significant increase in unemployment claims for\n\nformer federal employees received by NJDOL since January 20, 2025 and in particular since\n\nmid-February.\n\n       30. Private sector employers are required to file quarterly wage information via WR-\n\n30 and NJ-927s with NJDOL. However, federal public sector employers are not required to\n\nprovide such wage information.\n\n       31. For claims submitted by federal public sector employees, including every UCFE\n\nclaim, NJDOL must reach out to the employer to determine wage information and the\n\nemployer\u2019s reasons for the dismissal. The federal employer then has 10 days to respond to the\n\nrequest. Only when the information is received can the benefit amount calculation proceed. If\n\nthe information is not received, additional outreach to the claimant is required to obtain pay\n\nstubs and other wage verifying information. As a result, NJDOL must expend more time and\n\nresources to process UCFE claims than regular UI claims.\n\n       32. Furthermore, if there is a dispute between the employer and employee as to the\n\nreason for the termination, or if any reason is provided for the separation other than an\n\n\n\n                                              7\n\f  Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB            Document 4-11      Filed 03/07/25     Page 9 of 11\n\n\n\nagreement of lack of work between the employer and claimant, NJDOL\u2019s procedures require\n\nthat the claims examiner investigate the reason for discharge.\n\n       33. I understand from public reporting that many probationary workers were notified\n\nthat they were being terminated for performance. I therefore anticipate that at least some\n\nfederal agencies will maintain the position that the terminated probationary employees were\n\nfired due to poor performance.\n\n       34. NJDOL thus expects that it will have to follow our intensive investigative process\n\nto investigate the reasons for the firings of many probationary employees. While designed to\n\nensure fairness, the procedures impose a significant strain on NJDOL\u2019s financial and temporal\n\nresources. Each case demands a fact-finding proceeding and necessitates extensive staff hours\n\nfor scheduling, conducting phone interviews, reviewing evidence, and drafting detailed\n\ndecisions. The need to send notices, accommodate witness testimony, and facilitate cross-\n\nexamination further escalates the time commitment. Moreover, the potential for subsequent\n\nappeals triggers a cascade of additional hearings and reviews, diverting resources from other\n\nessential departmental functions.\n\n       35. The cumulative effect of these investigations translates to substantial expenditures\n\non personnel, administrative overhead, and the technological infrastructure required to manage\n\nthe burgeoning caseload, ultimately impacting NJDOL\u2019s budget and hindering its ability to\n\naddress other critical labor-related issues.\n\n       36. The same Department staff who handle regular unemployment claims also process\n\nand adjudicate UCFE claims. Redirecting staff from handling regular Unemployment\n\nInsurance (UI) claims to process and adjudicate this sudden influx of resource-intensive UCFE\n\nclaims threatens to strain our resources.\n\n\n\n                                               8\n\f Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 4-11        Filed 03/07/25      Page 10 of 11\n\n\n\n       37. This diversion of personnel will undoubtedly impede the timely processing of\n\nregular UI claims, creating backlogs and delays. The consequences will be far-reaching,\n\naffecting countless individuals who depend on swift resolutions to sustain their livelihoods.\n\n       38. Recent statements of the President and other federal officials have indicated that\n\nthe overwhelming majority of recent federal terminations were not for-cause firings, based on\n\nindividualized assessments of performance, but instead constitute a Government-wide effort\n\nto shrink the size of the federal workforce, an effective reduction in force.\n\n       39. As a result, it is likely that the overwhelming majority of recently-terminated\n\nfederal employees will in fact be eligible for state unemployment benefits, because they were\n\nnot terminated for cause.\n\n       40. However, statements in termination letters provided to probationary employees\n\nstate such terminations are for-cause and will necessitate extensive and irreparable\n\ninvestigatory costs and resource expenditures by NJDOL.\n\n           Increased Unemployment Benefits\n\n       41. Finally, New Jersey will also bear increased costs in the form of unemployment\n\nbenefits of ex-federal employees. While the federal government is generally required to\n\nreimburse New Jersey for UCFE benefits, New Jersey must pay such benefits in the first\n\ninstance, depleting the statewide trust fund that is supported by private employers in the state.\n\n       42. Moreover, the U.S. Secretary of Labor has discretion to reimburse states for\n\nadministrative costs required to conduct the state unemployment compensation program. 42\n\nU.S.C. \u00a7 502(a). While New Jersey has been and continues to expend additional resources\n\nnecessary to address the uptick in federal unemployment claims, it is thus entirely speculative\n\nwhether our Department\u2019s costs will be fully reimbursed.\n\n\n\n                                              9\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB   Document 4-11      Filed 03/07/25    Page 11 of 11\n\n\n\n\n                   Executed on March 5, 2025, at Trenton, New Jersey.\n\n\n\n\n                   Robert Asaro-Angelo, Commissioner\n                   New Jersey Department of Labor & Workforce Development\n\n\n\n\n                                   10\n\f",

I am a resident of the State of New York. I am over the age of 18 and have personal\n\nknowledge of all the facts stated herein, except as to those matters stated upon information and\n\nbelief; as to those matters, I believe them to be true. If called as a witness, I could and would testify\n\ncompetently to the matters set forth below.\n\n        2.      I am the Executive Deputy Commissioner of the New York State Department of\n\nLabor (NY DOL) and have nearly 30 years of government experience, including over 11 years at\n\nNY DOL. I began my tenure with NY DOL as a Special Assistant to the Commissioner in 2014,\n\nadvanced to Chief of Staff in 2016, and became Acting Executive Deputy Commissioner in 2020,\n\nfollowed by my appointment to my current role in 2021. I am responsible for the comprehensive\n\nmanagement of NY DOL\u2019s day-to-day operations and spending, overseeing 14 distinct divisions\n\nand offices within NY DOL, including the Workforce Development, Unemployment Insurance,\n\nand Worker Protection divisions.\n\n        3.      The NY DOL is responsible for helping New Yorkers find the careers they will\n\nlove by connecting them to employment, training, and up-skilling opportunities. As part of this\n\nmission, we assist workers who have been laid off from their jobs and process unemployment\n\napplications. NY DOL performs this function for all New Yorkers, including those who were\n\nemployed by the federal government. As Executive Deputy Commissioner, I have access to data\n\nmaintained by NY DOL documenting recent layoffs of federal workers in New York State.\n\n        4.      We have seen a significant increase in our most recent data of New Yorkers\n\nterminated by the federal government and seeking unemployment benefits. From January 21 \u2013\n\nFebruary 20, NY DOL received 178 new unemployment claims from federal employees. From\n\n\n\n                                                   1\n\f          Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB        Document 4-13           Filed 03/07/25   Page 4 of 5\n\n\n\nFebruary 21 \u2013 February 27, the most recently available data set, NY DOL logged an additional\n\n372 new unemployment claims from federal employees.\n\n          5.    These layoffs will require us to assist more New Yorkers and process more\n\nunemployment applications than expected, as we were not prepared for these numbers.\n\n          6.    NY DOL is designated as New York State\u2019s lead workforce development agency\n\npursuant to N.Y. Labor Law \u00a7 851. In this capacity, NY DOL oversees a Rapid Response program\n\nthat facilitates immediate assistance to New Yorkers subject to mass layoffs as required by the\n\nfederal Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 3174(A)(2)(i). NY DOL\u2019s no-\n\ncost services include, but are not limited to, skill-based resume development, access to user\n\nfriendly job search tools, and opportunities to engage in mock interviews to improve interviewing\n\nskills.\n\n          7.    The federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act imposes notice\n\nrequirements on private employers with respect to certain mass layoffs. Similarly, pursuant to 5\n\nU.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d)(3)(A)(i), the federal government is required to notify \u201cthe State or entity\n\ndesignated by the State to carry out rapid response activities under section 134(a)(2)(A) of the\n\nWorkforce Investment Act of 1998\u201d of a plan for a reduction-in-force (RIF) of federal employees,\n\ngenerally at least 60 days in advance of any proposed RIF. Pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 3361(a), the\n\nreference to section 134(a)(2)(A) of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 is deemed to refer to\n\nthe Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 3174(A)(2)(i). The notice required by\n\n5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d)(3)(A) is intended to trigger rapid response activities since it is directed to the\n\nstate entity required to carry out rapid response activities.\n\n          8.    To the best of my knowledge, NY DOL has not received any notices under 5 U.S.C.\n\n\u00a7 3502(d)(3)(A) since January 20, 2025.\n\n\n\n                                                   2\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB            Document 4-13         Filed 03/07/25      Page 5 of 5\n\n\n\n                Executed on March 6, 2025, at New York, New York,\n\n\n\n                                                /s/ Scott Melvin\n                                                Scott Melvin\n                                                Executive Deputy Commissioner\n                                                New York State Department of Labor\n\n\n*Counsel hereby certifies she has a signed copy of the foregoing document available for inspection at any\ntime by the court or a party to this action.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   3\n\f",

I am a resident of the State of Rhode Island and over the age of 18.\n\n2. I am the Associate Director for Community and Health Equity (\u201cCHE\u201d) Division at the Rhode\n\n   Island Department of Health (\u201cRIDOH\u201d) and have been held this position since January 2022.\n\n3. I hold a Master\u2019s Degree in Education and have been with RIDOH since 2009. I provide\n\n   leadership, strategic vision, and policy direction to staff and programs in the Division of CHE.\n\n   I work directly with the Director of RIDOH and other executive leadership staff to implement\n\n   RIDOH\u2019s mission to eliminate health disparities and achieve health equity for all Rhode\n\n   Islanders.\n\n4. The information in the statements set forth below was compiled through personal knowledge,\n\n   and from RIDOH personnel who have assisted in gathering this information from our agency.\n\n5. RIDOH\u2019s mission is to protect public health, promote healthy communities, and continue to\n\n   improve the quality of health care in Rhode Island. Among its many functions, RIDOH\n\n\n\n\n                                                1\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 4-15         Filed 03/07/25    Page 3 of 7\n\n\n\n   dedicates substantial resources to preventing the spread of infectious diseases, developing\n\n   comprehensive emergency preparedness plans to coordinate disaster response efforts, and\n\n   implementing public health programs.\n\n6. In conjunction with the mission of RIDOH, the Division of CHE strives to prevent diseases\n\n   and protect and promote health and safety of the people of Rhode Island.\n\n7. To support these critical goals, RIDOH and CHE have a long-standing history of securing\n\n   federal civil service personnel detail from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n\n   (\u201cCDC\u201d) through its Public Health Associate Program for Recent Graduates (\u201cPHAP\u201d). PHAP\n\n   is a competitive, two-year training program created by the CDC that places new college\n\n   graduates (\u201cAssociates\u201d) with tribal, local, and territorial public health agencies and\n\n   nongovernmental organizations. Associates work alongside other public health professionals\n\n   in a range of settings. Pursuant to the Public Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 215, RIDOH\n\n   enters into a two-year agreement with the CDC for each Associate detailed to RIDOH. CDC\n\n   covers all the Associate\u2019s costs, including their salary and benefits.\n\n8. Since 2017, RIDOH has hosted numerous PHAP Associates in the areas of emergency\n\n   preparedness, violence and injury prevention, and adolescent health. Their work has greatly\n\n   contributed to the work of RIDOH.\n\n9. Over the past two years, CDC detailed two (2) Associates at different RIDOH divisions to\n\n   perform core public health functions.\n\n10. One Associate was placed in RIDOH\u2019s Violence and Injury Prevention Program (\u201cVIPP\u201d),\n\n   which applied to become a host site for PHAP in February 2024. The VIPP Associate began\n\n   his 2-year term placement with VIPP in October 2024.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 2\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB         Document 4-15        Filed 03/07/25     Page 4 of 7\n\n\n\n11. RIDOH\u2019s VIPP planned to have the VIPP Associate contribute to cross-cutting initiatives\n\n   focused primarily on prevention of Adverse Childhood Experiences (\u201cACEs\u201d). There is no\n\n   dedicated funding or focus in the current VIPP portfolio for this type of work, despite ACEs\n\n   being a common risk factor of suicide and domestic violence.\n\n12. The work undertaken by the VIPP Associate provides an opportunity to advance initiatives\n\n   pertaining to violence prevention at multiple levels. As such, the VIPP Associate\u2019s work is\n\n   critical to the work undertaken throughout RIDOH. Notably, at the time of his termination, the\n\n   VIPP Associate was working on a comprehensive landscape analysis on Adverse Childhood\n\n   Experiences. This work, in turn, informs initiatives associated with Child Death Review\n\n   recommendations to identify preventable circumstances to improve health and safety for all\n\n   children.\n\n13. The second PHAP Associate was placed in RIDOH\u2019s Adolescent, School and Reproductive\n\n   Health (\u201cASRH\u201d) Programs, which has been a host site for the competitive PHAP since 2020.\n\n14. In February 2023, ASRH Programs applied to serve as a host site for another PHAP Associate.\n\n   In September 2023, RIDOH was notified that ASRH Programs were awarded as a host site and\n\n   matched with a PHAP candidate based upon our application. The ASRH Programs Associate\n\n   began her two-year term placement with the program in November 2023.\n\n15. ASRH Programs have invested nearly fifteen months hiring, onboarding, training, and\n\n   supporting the ASRH Programs Associate, to contribute to cross-cutting initiatives that\n\n   advance health and well-being for school-age children and adolescents in Rhode Island.\n\n16. Among other activities, the ASRH Programs Associate supported implementation of evidence-\n\n   based youth programming, technical assistance for schools and community-based partners, and\n\n   community outreach and engagement. The goal for this position was to help expand initiatives\n\n\n\n\n                                               3\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB         Document 4-15        Filed 03/07/25      Page 5 of 7\n\n\n\n   for positive youth-development programming, support communities of youth-serving\n\n   professionals, and develop collaborative community engagement and partnerships.\n\n17. RIDOH invested significant time and resources to train these Associates\u2014which typically\n\n   takes four to six months to complete\u2014to carry out the above-described work and integrate\n\n   them into the state\u2019s existing teams performing the same work.\n\n18. On February 19, 2025, RIDOH learned that the two Associates had been terminated from their\n\n   positions on February 15, 2025\u2014before the expiration of their contractual two-year terms\u2014\n\n   and placed on immediate administrative leave. Adding to the confusion, on March 5, 2025,\n\n   RIDOH informally learned that the two Associates have been notified that their positions will\n\n   be reinstated. RIDOH has yet to receive confirmation of this change from the CDC.\n\n19. Despite their reinstatement, the sudden loss of essential personnel, coupled with the lack of\n\n   notice, caused RIDOH significant harm and disruption. RIDOH had invested significant time\n\n   and resources into months-long training for the Associates, and the agency did not have the\n\n   budgetary flexibility or hiring authority to replace them, particularly given the lack of any\n\n   notice. The unexpected staffing shortages and imminent need to reallocate and train existing\n\n   staff have already caused delays and administrative chaos, which impeded RIDOH\u2019s ability to\n\n   fulfill its mission of preventing disease and promoting public health in the state. The loss in\n\n   workforce capacity during this time hampered RIDOH\u2019s ability to fully respond to these public\n\n   health threats.\n\n\n\n\n                                               4\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 4-15        Filed 03/07/25      Page 6 of 7\n\n\n\n20. The lack of notice compounded the challenges created by the terminations. RIDOH was not\n\n   able to plan for the terminations, resulting in administrative inefficiencies, duplicative work,\n\n   and impeded critical work undertaken by RIDOH.\n\n\n\n\nDated: March 6, 2025                                Signed: /s/ Kristine Campagna *\n                                                           Kristine Campagna\n                                                           RIDOH Division Director\n\n                                                    *A copy of the signature page bearing an\n                                                    original signature is attached hereto.\n\n\n\n\n                                                5\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB   Document 4-15   Filed 03/07/25   Page 7 of 7\n\f",

Clower, Ph.D.\nMarch 4, 2025\nAt the request of the Office of the Attorney General for the District of Columbia, I have prepared a\npreliminary assessment of the potential tax revenue and economic losses that would result from a\nreduction in the number of federal jobs based in the District of Columbia. The following provides a\ndescription of the findings, methods used, key assumptions, and sources of data in preparing this analysis.\nI reserve the right to modify this report based on the availability of new data and information.\nI serve as Northern Virginia Chair in Local Government and Professor of Public Policy in the Schar\nSchool of Policy and Government at George Mason University. I am also the director of the Center for\nRegional Analysis and the Stephen Fuller Institute at George Mason University. The analysis described\nhere is my own work and does not reflect the views or endorsement of George Mason University, its\nBoard of Visitors, or the Commonwealth of Virginia. Prior to joining George Mason University in August\nof 2014, I spent 23 years as an applied economic researcher at the University of North Texas with my\nfinal roles being an Associate Professor of Applied Economics and Director of the Center for Economic\nDevelopment and Research. I have performed or supervised more than three hundred analyses assessing\nthe economic and fiscal contributions of industries and employment in every state of the union.\nDescription of the Analysis\nThe findings reported below assess the loss of economic activity, jobs, and labor earnings and associated\nlocal government revenues associated with a reduction in the number of federal jobs based in the District\nof Columbia under five scenarios of direct federal job losses: 1,000 jobs; 2,000 jobs; 5,000 jobs; 10,000\njobs; and 50,000 jobs.\nData\nThere is little data immediately available on the exact positions and pay scales of jobs that are being\neliminated or are being targeted for elimination by the current federal administration. Therefore, this\nanalysis relies on several data assumptions that will tend toward understating the total potential impacts\non the District of Columbia\u2019s economy and government revenue.\nThe following data are used to model the impacts of federal job losses:\n\n      \u2022    Pay scale: The analysis uses the General Schedule (GS) Grades (1-15) in estimating lost direct\n           wages associated with the impacted federal jobs. This pay scale represents most federal jobs.\n           Executive, senior, and special scale jobs will typically have higher levels of compensation. By\n           using the GS pay scale, the impact estimates are likely to be conservative in nature.\n      \u2022    Distribution of federal employees by GS Grade: The current distribution of federal workers by\n           GS Grade was not readily available during the preparation of this analysis. Therefore, we\n           assumed the current distribution is the same as reported by the U.S. Equal Employment\n           Opportunity Commission for Fiscal Year 2013.1 This assumption likely results in understating the\n\n\n\n1\n    https://www.eeoc.gov/federal-sector/reports/table-3b-government-wide-employment-workers-gs-grades-1\n\f        Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB             Document 4-35           Filed 03/07/25         Page 10 of 31\n\n\n\n         total potential losses since previous trends and the aging federal workforce2 suggests that a higher\n         proportion of federal workers has likely shifted to higher GS levels. (See Table A-1 below.)\n    \u2022    Pay Level: Using the GS pay scale for 2025, adjusted for the District of Columbia Region, as\n         reported by FederalPay.org, and applying the distribution of federal workers as described above,\n         the weighted average wage/salary for the federal workers who have or may lose their jobs is\n         assumed to be $104,274 per annum. Using data from a federal employment information website3,\n         the average full time federal job has benefits valued at about 43.7% of direct pay. This adjustment\n         results in total assumed average compensation for federal jobs in the District of Columbia at\n         $149,844 per annum.\nModel\nTo estimate how the loss of federal jobs in the District of Columbia will impact District revenues and\neconomic activity, assumed job losses at the estimated total compensation (wages, salaries, and benefits)\nare used as modeling inputs into the IMPLAN4 economic input-output model. The IMPLAN model is\nwidely used in academic and professional research and provides estimates of how a change in economic\nactivity, such as jobs, spreads through a regional economy. In a typical analysis of business activity, the\nIMPLAN model includes direct spending and/or job creation, indirect effects resulting from business\nspending by vendors in a given firm\u2019s supply chains, and induced impacts that represent the economic\nactivity from employees of the direct firm and vendors spending a portion of their earnings for goods and\nservices in the economy. The IMPLAN adjusts the spending to account for economic leakage\u2014spending\nthat leaves the study area as purchases of imported goods and services. For example, many federal\nworkers spend a portion of their earnings on automobiles and gasoline, neither of which is produced in the\nDistrict of Columbia but is sold there. When added together, the adjusted spending represented by direct,\nindirect, and induced effects is often greater than the direct spending, which is the \u201cmultiplier\u201d effect.\nUnfortunately, multipliers work in both directions. A loss of a federal job means that former job holders\nwill have less household income to purchase goods and services, which lowers aggregate demand and has\nspillover effects on other jobs in the District of Columbia.5\nAn important caveat and feature of modeling the impacts, positive or negative, of federal jobs is that the\nIMPLAN model only estimates induced (household spending) impacts for this sector of the economy.\nIndirect effects, purchases related to supporting that job, are treated through separately assessing\ngovernment procurement. In this analysis, we have no information that allows us to estimate how these\njob losses would be reflected in government procurement. For example, we do not know if the workers\nare in federally owned or leased buildings or what equipment and supplies will not be required by\ngovernment agencies with reduced staffing levels. Therefore, the estimates offered below do not include\nindirect government spending effects.\nThe IMPLAN model provides estimates of:\n\n    \u2022    Economic Activity: A measure of business transactions.\n    \u2022    Gross State Product: The regional equivalent of economic value added similar to gross domestic\n         product.\n\n2\n  https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/02/07/fauci-government-workforce-aging-hire-young/\n3\n  https://federaljobs.net/benefits/\n4\n  Impact Modeling for PLANning, developed by MIG, Inc.\n5\n  The IMPLAN model has constant coefficients. At high levels of employment disruption, the fundamental structure\nof the District\u2019s economy would change, and an input-output model framework will likely understate the total losses\nin economic activity and tax revenue.\n\f        Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 4-35          Filed 03/07/25       Page 11 of 31\n\n\n\n    \u2022    Labor Income: Salaries, wages, and benefits.\n    \u2022    Jobs: Expressed as modified full-time equivalent jobs.\n    \u2022    Corporate Profits Tax: Taxes paid on corporate earnings.

To\nassess the potential economic and revenue losses under an assumption that federal workers quickly find\nalternative employment, the analysis presented below compared federal jobs by occupation and posted\nopen positions in the District of Columbia. The key assumption, which may not hold in practice, is that\ndisplaced federal workers can obtain other employment in a matching occupation. For example, the\nassumption is that a private sector, for-profit business will see a long term federal employee as being\nqualified based on government job experience.\nIn performing this analysis, data on federal staffing patterns (jobs by occupation) for the District of\nColumbia from Lightcast are compared to a listing of job postings also from Lightcast. The job postings\ndata are gathered through web-scraping online job advertisement postings that are algorithmically\nadjusted to prevent duplicating job postings across differing websites. Both data sets include estimates of\nwages by occupation, which allows an estimate of any wage differentials and the resulting impacts on\neconomic activity and tax revenue.6 There is emerging concern among labor market analysts that an\nincreasing share of job posting are \u201cghost\u201d jobs, meaning that employers use the advertisements and\npostings to collect resumes for filling potential future job openings. However, to be conservative, this\nanalysis assumes the counts of unique job postings represent opportunities for similarly skilled displaced\nfederal workers. In addition, it appears that about 4.3% of the matching job ads are for federal jobs. We\nhave left these jobs in the calculations of alternative jobs, which may result in underestimating total job\nand tax revenue losses. The appendix includes a sample of the data gathered.\n\n\n\n6\n There is earnings data missing for some occupations in the job posting data. Absent any other information, this\nanalysis assumes the same federal and private sector wage rate for those occupations.\n\f        Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB             Document 4-35           Filed 03/07/25         Page 13 of 31\n\n\n\nOne important adjustment made to the Lightcast data is to convert wage/salary data to total compensation\nlevels that include the value of benefits.7 For federal jobs, the adjustment is the same as described above.\nFor private sector jobs, benefits add an average 29.6% increase to wages based on data from the U.S.\nBureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 Employer Costs for Employee Compensation data series. As might be\nexpected, in some occupations, such as those in certain information technology occupations, at lower\nlevels of federal job losses it is reasonable to assume the displaced federal workers can find alternative\nemployment. However, flooding the market with new job seekers in a brief period will exceed current\nlabor demand. This could result in an out-migration of workers that will permanently impact the local and\nregional economy. That analysis is beyond the scope of this initial impact assessment. Even adjusted for\nhigher benefit levels, in most occupations, a federal worker could potentially receive an effective pay\nraise for moving to the private sector. For purposes of adjusting our initial estimates to account for\nalternative employment opportunities, the analysis uses partial, not whole number, job counts.\nIt is important to emphasize that this analysis is based on the distribution of occupations across all District\nof Columbia based civilian federal workers. There is no information available for this analysis that details\nthe distribution of occupations of those positions that have been and will be terminated.\nThe alternative analysis shows that at lower levels of federal job disruption, many of the displaced\nworkers may be able to find alternative employment, which will mitigate the economic and fiscal losses\nfor the District of Columbia (see Table 3).\nTable 3: Economic and Tax Revenue Losses from a Reduction in Federal Jobs in the District of\nColumbia, Assuming Similar Alternative Employment for Displaced Workers, Annual Losses,\n($2025)\n    Number of Federal Jobs Lost        1,000           2,000            5,000            10,000             50,000\n    Number of Net Jobs Lost             204             505             1,642             4,732             41,514\n    Economic Losses\n    Economic Activity Reduction     $58,235,110    $134,153,824      $412,195,150    $1,130,899,335     $8,972,689,044\n    Gross State Product Lost        $56,205,102    $129,477,377      $397,826,506    $1,091,477,500     $8,659,911,541\n    Labor Income                    $45,089,210    $103,870,154      $319,146,876      $875,611,928     $6,947,208,571\n    Total Direct & Induced Jobs           227.0            561.6           1,826.8           5,263.1           46,176.4\n    Tax Loses\n    Corporate Profits Tax              $210,535        $485,000        $1,490,190        $4,088,487        $32,438,538\n    Income Tax                         $548,482      $1,263,515        $3,882,222       $10,651,272        $84,508,449\n    Sales Tax                           $99,030        $228,132          $700,948        $1,923,123        $15,258,284\n    Property Tax                       $191,737        $441,698        $1,357,141        $3,723,454        $29,542,323\n    Other Taxes & Assessments           $50,371        $116,037          $356,532          $978,181          $7,761,003\n    TOTAL TAX LOSSES                 $1,100,155      $2,534,383        $7,787,033       $21,364,516       $169,508,598\nSources: U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, FederalPay.org, Bureau of Labor Statistics,\nFederalJobs.net, Lightcast, IMPLAN, author\u2019s calculations.\n\n\n\n\n7\n Lightcast reports estimates of median earnings.

The FY 2025 local source revenue forecast has been revised downward\nby $21.6 million as year-to-date collections show lower-than-expected receipts for the sales and\nnon-tax revenue sources. The revenue forecast for the rest of the financial plan period has also\nbeen revised downward by an average of $342.1 million annually, largely due to forecasted sharp\ndeclines in employment levels as the Federal government proceeds with reducing its workforce\nsignificantly. The resulting decline in income and consumption means lower revenue from the\nDistrict\u2019s individual income and sales taxes. Real property tax revenue in this estimate has also\nbeen lowered based on lower assessed values across almost all classes of properties. This reflects\nongoing weakness in commercial property values due to expanded remote work since the\npandemic and a recent decline in residential home prices.\n\nFebruary 2025 Revenue Estimate Compared to Previous Estimate\n                                                      Actual            Estimate                      Projections\nLocal Source, General Fund Revenue\nEstimate ($M)                                        FY 2024 FY 2025 FY 2026 FY 2027 FY 2028 FY 2029\nDecember 2024 Revenue Estimate                       10,232.2 10,701.8 10,955.6 11,255.2 11,642.0\n  February Revision to the Estimate-Local                 -8.3    -21.6  -325.0   -337.8   -363.2\nFebruary 2025 Revenue Estimate                       10,223.9 10,680.2 10,630.6 10,917.4 11,278.7 11,656.4\n\nRevenue Change From Previous Year\n Amount                                                  249.4        456.3       (49.6)        286.7          361.4   377.6\n  Year-Over-Year Percent Change                          2.5%         4.5%        -0.5%         2.7%           3.3%    3.3%\n\n\n                   John A.

Changes in the economic landscape as the\nnew administration proceeds with reductions to the federal workforce will shape revenue trends\nfor the remainder of FY 2025.\nDue to ongoing and planned federal workforce reductions, the District's economic outlook has\ndeteriorated significantly from the December forecast. Nationally, over 75,000 federal employees\nhave accepted buyouts, many probationary federal employees have been fired, and the\nadministration has instituted a hiring freeze, allowing only one replacement employee for every\nfour that leave. Federal employment in the District is projected to decline by approximately 40,000,\nor 21 percent, by the end of the financial plan period. With fewer federal employees in the region,\nspending on restaurants, retail, transportation, and other taxable goods and services is expected to\ndecline, particularly for businesses that rely on federal workers. Job losses are also anticipated for\nfederal contracting, hospitality, and transportation sectors, as reduced federal employment leads\nto lower demand in these sectors. There is a high degree of uncertainty around the forecast as some\nof the new administration's executive actions have or likely will be challenged in the courts, as\nnew ones emerge, making meaningful economic impact analysis extremely difficult.\nA variety of sources provide the basis for this estimate, including cash collection reports; federal\ndata on District population, employment, and income; private data sources on housing, commercial\nreal estate, and hotels; forecasts of the U.S. economy prepared by the Congressional Budget Office,\nand private-sector economists, including the Blue Chip consensus forecast of 50 private sector\neconomists and two private-sector firms (S&P Global and Moody\u2019s Analytics) that also prepare\nforecasts of the District\u2019s economy. In addition, comments were received from recent meetings of\nthree advisory groups of external subject-matter experts. These discussions focused on general\nbusiness and economic conditions and real estate market developments in the District and the\nneighboring jurisdictions.\n\nRevenue Highlights\nReal Property Tax\nReal property tax revenue for FY 2025 is unchanged from the December forecast. For FY 2026,\nthe revenue forecast has been revised downward by $113 million due to a 2.2 percent decline in\nthe total taxable real property assessments compared to FY 2025. These assessments reflect a\nsignificant adjustment that includes the most recent market valuations. With the reductions in\nassessments, real property tax revenue for FY 2026 is expected to decline by 3.2 percent.\nWhile the revenue forecast for FY 2027 and FY 2028 has been revised downward from previous\nestimates, the projected growth rates have been adjusted upward from the December forecast for\ntwo key reasons. First, CoStar\u2019s latest projections indicate that office market values will rise in\n2026, driven by improving vacancy rates, higher rents per square foot, and favorable market\ncapitalization rates. Second, the substantial downward adjustment to FY 2026 property\nassessments means the forecasted improvements in market valuations start from a lower base. As\na result, real property tax revenue is expected to grow by an average of 2.6 percent annually during\nthe period FY 2027 through FY 2029.\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 4-35        Filed 03/07/25      Page 18 of 31\nFebruary 2025 Revenue Estimates\nFebruary 28, 2025\nPage 3\n\nSales Tax\nThe February forecast for general sales tax revenue has been lowered significantly across the\nforecast period due to anticipated sharp reductions in federal employment and their ripple effect\non the District\u2019s economy and tax base. Downward revisions begin with a relatively modest $15\nmillion in FY 2025, escalating to nearly $80 million by FY 2028. The smaller impact in FY 2025\nis based on substantial collections for the first quarter, amounting to nearly 4 percent growth year-\nto-date. However, as District employment deteriorates, consumers are expected to spend less,\nreducing sales tax receipts.\nThe average annual growth rate of 2.9 percent for sales tax over the financial plan period is\nprimarily driven by incremental sales tax rate increases enacted under the FY 2025 Budget Support\nAct (BSA); from 6 percent in FY 2025 to 6.5 percent in FY 2026 and 7 percent in FY 2027 and\nonwards. Without these rate increases, underlying sales tax revenue growth would be notably\nweaker due to employment reductions.\nIncome Taxes\nIndividual Income Taxes\nYear-to-date individual income tax receipts have grown 6.9 percent, driven entirely by an 8.2\npercent increase in withholding tax collections compared to last year. However, withholding tax\nrevenue growth is expected to slow as the federal workforce reductions decrease the wages and\nsalaries of District residents. For FY 2025, the economic outlook for resident wages has been\nrevised only slightly, meaning the strong year-to-date collections will help offset any immediate\nimpact. The withholding tax revenue forecast for FY 2026 through FY 2029 has been revised\ndownward to reflect the full impact of the federal job cuts; by $94.7 million in FY 2026 and an\naverage reduction of $139.7 million per year for the rest of the financial plan period.\nNon-withholding income taxes are down 3.4 percent year-to-date compared to last year, primarily\ndue to higher refunds. However, January estimated payments, a key indicator of the upcoming\nApril tax filings, rose 3.8 percent. This is a notable improvement from the double-digit declines\nseen in FY 2023 and FY 2024. As a result, the FY 2025 non-withholding tax revenue forecast was\nrevised upward and is now projected to increase by 9.5 percent to reflect the improved estimated\npayments performance in January. Beyond FY 2025, the forecast for non-withholding taxes has\nbeen revised downward, reflecting expectations of weaker S&P 500 earnings as the market adjusts\nto align with its long-term average after the increases over the last two years.\nOverall individual income tax is projected to increase by 4.5 percent in FY 2025 and decline by\n0.7 percent in FY 2026. Growth is expected to average 3.2 percent for the remainder of the\nfinancial plan period.\nCorporate Franchise Tax\nYear-to-date corporation franchise tax receipts have risen 13.9 percent compared to the same\nperiod last year, driven by higher estimated and final tax payments. As a result, the FY 2025\ncorporate franchise tax revenue forecast has been revised upward by $13.4 million.\nThe forecast for the out years is slightly reduced, reflecting the lower earnings forecasts for large\npublic companies in defense and other government support service sectors. As a result, corporate\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 4-35        Filed 03/07/25       Page 19 of 31\nFebruary 2025 Revenue Estimates\nFebruary 28, 2025\nPage 4\n\nfranchise taxes are expected to decline by 1.4 percent in FY 2026 and revert to an average growth\nof 1.3 percent through the remainder of the financial plan period.\nUnincorporated Business Franchise Tax\nYear-to-date unincorporated business tax receipts have surged by 18.2 percent, a sharp reversal\nfrom the 10.4 percent decline projected in the December forecast. This growth is largely driven by\nhigher January estimated tax payments, which historically served as a key indicator for the April\ntax filing season. As a result, the FY 2025 unincorporated business tax revenue forecast has been\nrevised upward by $15.8 million, reflecting both the strong year-to-date gains and adjustments for\nthe estimated impact of previously enacted tax credits. While the previously forecasted decline in\nunincorporated business tax revenue for FY 2025 has been revised to 2.2 percent (an improvement\nfrom the earlier 10.4 percent decline), the growth rate for the remainder of the financial plan period\nis expected to remain negative, amidst continued challenges for the real estate sector, from which\nmost District unincorporated businesses derive their earnings.\nGross Receipts Tax Revenues\nYear-to-date gross receipts tax collections have increased 15.2 percent in FY 2025, driven\nprimarily by higher sports wagering and public utility tax payments compared to FY 2024. The\nextreme cold weather has likely contributed to increased public utility consumption, prompting an\nupward revision to the previous forecast. Additionally, insurance premium tax receipts, another\nkey component of gross receipts, have shown strong year-to-date gains, benefiting from the impact\nof higher inflation on insurance premium collections. As a result, the gross receipts tax revenue\nforecast has been revised upward by $18.1 million for FY 2025, and by an average of $31.8 million\nannually from FY 2026 to FY 2028.\nDeed Tax Revenues\nYear-to-date deed tax collections\u2014including deed recordation, deed transfer, and economic\ninterest taxes\u2014have increased 20 percent compared to FY 2024, driven by a higher volume and\nvalue of commercial, single-family, and vacant property sales. This growth aligns with the\nDecember forecast, and as a result, the deed taxes revenue forecast remains largely unchanged.\nNon-Tax Revenue\nThe non-tax revenue forecast for the financial plan period has been significantly reduced, primarily\ndue to downward revisions in fines and miscellaneous revenue. Recent data on the expanded\nautomated traffic enforcement units implemented last year indicate lower-than-expected ticket\nissuance rates, leading to a downward revision in fines and forfeitures revenue by an average of\n$23.1 million annually throughout the forecast period. Additionally, lower than expected\ninvestment income from reserves\u2014driven by a combination of reduced investible reserves and\nlower interest rates compared to the previous year\u2014has led to a significant reduction in the\nmiscellaneous revenue component of local fund revenue.\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 4-35         Filed 03/07/25     Page 20 of 31\nFebruary 2025 Revenue Estimates\nFebruary 28, 2025\nPage 5\n\nNational and Regional Economies\n\nNational Economy\n\nU.S. GDP grew at an annual rate of 2.3 percent in the fourth quarter, according to the Bureau of\nEconomic Analysis\u2019 (BEA) advance estimate. Final sales to private domestic purchasers, a key\nmeasure of underlying demand, rose 3.2 percent, reflecting strong momentum. For the full year\nof 2024, the economy expanded by a solid 2.8 percent, exceeding economists' expectations. The\nprimary driver of GDP growth was consumer spending, which accounted for 1.9 percent of the\nannual growth rate. Consumer spending has remained the cornerstone of economic growth in the\npost-pandemic years, supporting robust expansion despite the Federal Reserve\u2019s efforts to slow\nthe economy in its fight against inflation.\n\nInflation continued to ease in 2024, but progress toward the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2 percent target has\nslowed. For the year, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index rose by only 2.5\npercent, a significant decline from 3.8 percent in 2023. Excluding food and energy, the core PCE\nprice index increased by 2.8 percent, down from 4.1 percent the previous year. However,\ninflationary pressures picked up toward the end of the year, with the core CPI inflation rate rising\nfrom 2.4 percent in Q3 to 3.6 percent in Q4.\n\nThe labor market rebounded after a slowdown in the third quarter of 2024, demonstrating renewed\nmomentum. The January 2025 employment report showed a strong increase in payrolls, significant\nupward revisions to job growth for November and December 2024, and a drop in the\nunemployment rate to 4 percent.\n\nEmployment growth in the Washington metropolitan area continued to lag the national average in\n2024, with regional employment increasing 0.8 percent for the year compared to 1.3 percent\nnationally. Slowing job growth is likely to remain a drag on the region\u2019s economy.\n\nU.S. Recent History\n                                                       2023q4    2024q1 2024q2 2024q3 2024q4\nReal GDP (% change from prior year)                      3.2       2.9      3.0      2.7    2.5\nNominal GDP (% change from prior year)                   5.8       5.4      5.7     5.0     5.0\nNominal Personal Income (% change from prior year)       5.1       5.9      5.5     5.2     5.4\nUnemployment rate (%)                                    3.8       3.8      4.0     4.2     4.1\nCPI (% change from prior year)                            3.2        3.2     3.2     2.6     2.7\nYield on 10-Yr Treasury (%)                               4.4        4.2     4.4     4.0     4.3\nS&P 500 (avg level)                                     4,472       4,996 5,254 5,546 5,911\nSource: Bureau of Economic Analysis, Bureau of Labor Statistics, SP Global and Moody\u2019s Analytics.\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 4-35          Filed 03/07/25       Page 21 of 31\nFebruary 2025 Revenue Estimates\nFebruary 28, 2025\nPage 6\n\nU.S. Economic Outlook\n                                        FY 2024    FY 2025   FY 2026    FY 2027    FY 2028   FY 2029\n                                        (actual)    (est.)

Many analysts predict that implementing substantial import\ntariffs temporarily increases inflation in 2025, while workforce reductions may slow national\nemployment growth. However, since federal employees (excluding the U.S. Postal Service)\naccount for just over 1.4 percent of the civilian workforce, overall employment is still expected to\nexpand in the coming months.\n\nThe Federal Reserve held the federal funds rate steady at its January 2025 meeting, maintaining a\ntotal of 100 basis points in rate cuts since the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) began\nadjusting the target range in September 2024. While moderating inflation has given the Federal\nReserve room to ease monetary policy, strong job growth and a recent increase in core CPI\ninflation have reduced the urgency for further cuts. Lower rates will be welcomed by prospective\nhomebuyers, many of whom were priced out of the housing market due to previously high\nborrowing costs. Additionally, rate cuts should relieve pressure on other interest-sensitive sectors,\nproviding a boost to the broader economy, and greater stability in the job market. The Federal\nReserve is expected to pause additional rate reductions in the first half of 2025 to assess the\neconomic impact of federal policy changes.\n\nBased on insights from sources such as S&P Global and Moody's, we expect the recent strength\nin economic growth to be carried over to the first half of calendar 2025. However, growth is\nexpected to moderate in the second half of 2025 and in 2026 due to policy uncertainties and high\ninterest rates. The GDP projections, along with forecasts for other economic activities in the nation\nand the District of Columbia, depend on a combination of factors, including key economic\nindicators, global market trends, geopolitical events, and changes in monetary and fiscal policy.\nThe inherent uncertainties and complexities influencing current economic dynamics make it\ncrucial to monitor these factors closely to gain a comprehensive understanding of the evolving\neconomic landscape.\n\nDistrict Economy\n\nWhile the District\u2019s economy continues to recover from the pandemic-induced recession of 2020,\nit has consistently underperformed the national economy across most indicators. The District\nremains below pre-pandemic employment levels, with approximately 26,600 fewer jobs recorded\nin the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to early 2020 (Q1 2020). Among major industries, only the\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 4-35        Filed 03/07/25      Page 22 of 31\nFebruary 2025 Revenue Estimates\nFebruary 28, 2025\nPage 7\n\nProfessional and Management sector and the District of Columbia government had surpassed their\nearly 2020 employment levels by the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nEmployment growth in the District has accelerated this year. From the fourth quarter of 2023 to\nthe fourth quarter of 2024, total employment in the District increased by 11,200 jobs (1.4 percent\nyear-over-year), surpassing both the District\u2019s historical average and the national growth rate of\n1.2 percent.\n\nThe professional and management sector led job gains, adding 5,261 positions over the year. The\nLeisure and Hospitality sector, which suffered severe job losses during the pandemic\u2014shedding\n60 percent of its workforce in the second quarter of 2020\u2014has rebounded to 97 percent of pre-\npandemic levels. Additionally, the Other Services sector, which includes nonprofit organizations,\nrecorded a strong gain of 3,433 jobs.\n\nOther sectors, including trade, transportation and utilities, education and health, and the District\ngovernment experienced modest job growth. In contrast, employment in the federal government,\ninformation and financial services, and business services sectors, along with other private\nindustries, saw slight declines.\n\nThe District's unemployment rate averaged 5.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2024. Although still\nnear historically low levels, it increased from 4.9 percent in the same quarter of the previous year,\nand has been rising for the past two years. This trend suggests that the District's labor market is\nstruggling to absorb the new residents it continues to attract.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, the District\u2019s real gross state product (GSP) reached $149.5 billion,\ngrowing 2 percent from the second quarter. The economy is driven primarily by five key sectors\u2014\nGovernment (including Federal and D.C.) at 30 percent, Professional, Management and Business\nServices at 22 percent, Finance and Real Estate Services at 13 percent, Information Services at 9\npercent, and Other Services at 6 percent\u2014which together account for 80 percent of the District\u2019s\nGSP. Growth in the third quarter was largely concentrated in just two sectors: professional,\nmanagement and business services and information services, which accounted for 80 percent of\nthe expansion.\n\nPersonal income in the District grew by 5.1 percent in the third quarter of 2024, slightly trailing\nthe national increase of 5.2 percent during the same period. Per capita personal income in the\nDistrict has consistently exceeded that of all 50 states. In 2023, it reached $106,816, compared to\nthe national average of $69,810, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. The District\nserves as a hub for high-paying jobs, driven largely by the substantial presence of the federal\ngovernment, which offers salaries well above the national average. In the third quarter of 2024,\nthe federal government accounted for 27.6 percent of all wages in the District. Additionally,\nproximity to federal agencies attracts private contractors that provide competitive wages to skilled\nprofessionals. Despite its high-income sectors, the District also has a significant lower-income\npopulation, with 14 percent of residents living below the poverty line in 2023.\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 4-35         Filed 03/07/25      Page 23 of 31\nFebruary 2025 Revenue Estimates\nFebruary 28, 2025\nPage 8\n\n D.C.

Although personal income growth in the\nDistrict lagged the national average during the pandemic years, it experienced a strong rebound in\n2022\u20132023. As a result, by the third quarter of 2024, the District's personal income had nearly\nreturned to pace with the national trend.\n\nTourism is a vital component of the District\u2019s economy, employing approximately 10 percent of\nthe city\u2019s workforce. According to Destination DC, the city welcomed nearly 26 million visitors\nin the past year, including 24 million domestic and 1.95 million international travelers. Strong\ndemand from both consumers and businesses has driven a surge in activity at the region\u2019s major\nairports\u2014Ronald Reagan Washington National, Washington Dulles International, and\nBaltimore/Washington International\u2014with airport traffic increasing by 7 percent in the 12 months\nending September 2024 compared to the previous year. The hospitality sector has also seen gains,\nwith 3.2 percent more hotel-room-days sold in the fourth quarter of 2024 than a year ago, while\nthe average room rate rose by 4.6 percent. Additionally, weekend rail ridership on WMATA in\n2024 surpassed pre-pandemic levels, marking an 11 percent increase from 2023.\n\nHigher mortgage interest rates have slowed existing home sales both nationally and regionally\nfrom their post-pandemic highs. In the District, the number of active housing units for sale remains\nexceptionally low, with closed sales of existing homes in 2024 totaling approximately 6,900 units,\nthe lowest level in over a decade. Housing starts have also declined sharply, falling to an annual\nrate of 1,426 units in the fourth quarter. Although this represents a slight rebound from the decade-\nlow of 972 units in the third quarter, it is still below the 2,131 units recorded in the same period of\n2023. This slowdown has had a broad economic impact, reducing revenue in real estate and\nconstruction-related sectors, and likely contributing to the region\u2019s tight labor market, further\nlimiting economic expansion.\n\nHighlighting a positive trend, the District\u2019s civilian labor force and resident employment surpassed\ntheir pre-pandemic peak in the first quarter of 2024. After experiencing a significant population\ndecline in 2020, the District has recorded three consecutive years of population growth, reversing\nthe losses seen during the COVID-19 pandemic. In December 2024, the U.S. Census Bureau\nreleased updated estimates showing that the District\u2019s population grew from 687,324 to 702,250\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 4-35        Filed 03/07/25         Page 24 of 31\nFebruary 2025 Revenue Estimates\nFebruary 28, 2025\nPage 9\n\nbetween July 2023 and July 2024, a net increase of 14,926 residents.

The District has the most\ngovernment-centered economy in the United States, a characteristic that offers both stability and\nchallenges. Historically, the substantial presence of federal agencies helps buffer against economic\nfluctuations that may disrupt private-sector industries. During the early months of the pandemic,\nfederal employment in the District expanded as the government increased its role in crisis response,\nhiring more staff for agencies focused on health, safety, and economic recovery.\n\nThe efforts to reduce the federal workforce are expected to have a disproportionate impact on the\nDistrict\u2019s economy. While federal jobs (excluding the U.S. Postal Service) make up just 1.4\npercent of the U.S. civilian workforce, they account for close to 25 percent of total civilian\nemployment in the District. Additionally, a significant portion of the Professional and\nManagement Services sector depends on federal funding and contracts. As a result, widespread\nfederal layoffs could have major ripple effects throughout the District\u2019s economy.\n\nWe have updated our February forecast to reflect the impact of ongoing and planned federal\nworkforce reductions on the District\u2019s economy. Federal employment in the District is expected\nto drop to 150k by the end of our forecasting period, a reduction of 40,000, or 21%, compared to\nthe previous forecast. Real GDP is now projected to grow by 0.9 percent in FY 2025, trailing the\nnational growth rate of 2.4 percent. The District\u2019s economy is expected to enter a mild recession\nin FY 2026, with GDP contracting by 1.9 percent, before beginning a gradual recovery in FY 2027\nand returning to trend growth by FY 2028 and FY 2029. Employment in the District is expected\nto remain flat in FY 2025, decline by 2.6 percent in FY 2026, and decrease by 0.4 percent in FY\n2027. Other key economic indicators have also been adjusted to reflect these latest trends.\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB            Document 4-35         Filed 03/07/25       Page 25 of 31\nFebruary 2025 Revenue Estimates\nFebruary 28, 2025\nPage 10\n\nRisks to the Forecast\n\nThe current forecast carries several notable risks. As a government-driven economy, the District\nrelies heavily on federal jobs and related economic activity, making the new administration\u2019s\npolicies a key factor in shaping the city's economic outlook. The uncertainty surrounding federal\npolicies adds complexity to forecasting. While some of the administration\u2019s proposed budget and\npersonnel cuts may be curtailed by legal challenges, the economic impact on the District will be\nmore severe if more job cuts than assumed in the forecast are implemented.\n\nThe office real estate market poses a significant risk to the forecast, with the growing volume of\nvacant office space a major concern. The average vacancy rate for office buildings in the central\nbusiness district reached 18.1% in the fourth quarter of 2024. A recent study by the D.C. Office of\nRevenue Analysis revealed that between 2020 and 2023, vacant office space increased by 8.4\nmillion square feet, a 46.2% rise, primarily driven by the shift toward remote work. This trend is\nexpected to persist for at least the next few years, even with the recent return-to-office order for\nfederal employees. The assessed values of hundreds of office buildings are projected to remain\ndepressed through 2029. A sharper-than-anticipated decline in property values could pose a risk\nto commercial property and deed tax revenues.\n\nAdditionally, potential WMATA service reductions to address its budget shortfall represent\nanother risk to the forecast. Other risks include a surge in oil prices due to the escalation of regional\nconflicts and the prospect of a prolonged government shutdown, which could place significant\nstrain on the economy. Previous government shutdowns disrupted the District\u2019s economy and had\na range of impacts on revenue.\n\nThe prevailing risks and high degree of uncertainty make for a challenging forecasting\nenvironment. As such, we will continue to monitor international, national, and local economic\nactivity for any developments that would impair the forecast.\n\nIf you have any questions regarding these matters, please contact me at (202) 727-2476.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n\n\nGlen Lee\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 4-35       Filed 03/07/25        Page 26 of 31\nFebruary 2025 Revenue Estimates\nFebruary 28, 2025\nPage 11\n\n\nDISTRIBUTION LIST\nCouncilmember Anita Bonds (At-Large)\nCouncilmember Robert White (At-Large)\nCouncilmember Christina Henderson (At-Large)\nCouncilmember Kenyan McDuffie (At-Large)\nCouncilmember Brianne Nadeau (Ward 1)\nCouncilmember Brooke Pinto (Ward 2)\nCouncilmember Matthew Frumin (Ward 3)\nCouncilmember Janeese Lewis George (Ward 4)\nCouncilmember Zachary Parker (Ward 5)\nCouncilmember Charles Allen (Ward 6)\nCouncilmember Wendell Felder (Ward 7)\nKevin Donahue, City Administrator\nLindsey Parker, Chief of Staff, Executive Office of the Mayor\nJennifer Reed, Director, Mayor\u2019s Office of Budget and Performance Management\nJennifer Budoff, Budget Director, Council of the District of Columbia\nKathy Patterson, District of Columbia Auditor\n\f     Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB              Document 4-35         Filed 03/07/25      Page 27 of 31\nFebruary 2025 Revenue Estimates\nFebruary 28, 2025\nPage 12\n\n\nTABLE 1: REVENUE SUMMARY TABLE\n$ in Thousands               ACTUAL                  ESTIMATE                    OUT YEAR PROJECTIONS\n                             FY2024            FY2025       FY2026        FY2027        FY2028      FY2029\nPROPERTY                       3,039,519         2,962,559    2,869,971     2,923,002     2,991,302    3,094,247\n    Real Property              2,916,752         2,840,877    2,751,103     2,803,929     2,870,687    2,972,995\n    Personal Property             83,354            82,388       80,392        79,857        81,398       82,033\n    Public Space Rental           39,413            39,294       38,477        39,216        39,217       39,218\n    Dedicated to other funds     -52,541           -33,513      -28,399       -28,913       -24,610      -25,319\nPROPERTY (NET)                 2,986,978         2,929,046    2,841,572     2,894,088     2,966,691    3,068,927\nSALES & EXCISE                 2,084,378         2,131,157    2,209,560     2,282,908     2,335,999    2,388,608\n    General Sales              2,001,987         2,050,696    2,127,033     2,201,667     2,254,202    2,312,104\n    Alcohol                        7,027             6,886        6,817         6,715         6,782        6,850\n    Cigarette                      9,763             8,770        8,673         8,578         8,484        8,391\n    Motor Vehicle                 43,823            43,282       45,884        45,163        46,097       41,179\n    Motor Fuel                    21,778            21,523       21,152        20,786        20,434       20,084\n    Dedicated to other funds    -593,709          -579,313     -573,083      -563,399      -553,477     -561,132\nSALES & EXCISE(NET)            1,490,670         1,551,844    1,636,477     1,719,509     1,782,522    1,827,475\nINCOME                         4,271,954         4,413,057    4,356,061     4,492,741     4,597,600    4,703,284\n    Individual Income          3,138,951         3,281,725    3,258,162     3,368,786     3,473,995    3,578,790\n    Corporate Franchise          932,363           935,123      922,100       954,457       951,058      958,657\n    U.B.

My name is Jeffrey Grant. I am over the age of 18 and able to provide true and accurate\n\ntestimony under oath.\n\n2.     I give this declaration based upon my personal knowledge of the facts recited.\n\n3.     I am a resident of the State of Maryland.\n\n4.     On February 28, 2025, I retired from my role as the Deputy Director for Operations in the\n\nCenter for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight (CCIIO) within the Centers for\n\nMedicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) after 41 years of federal service.\n\n5.     In my role as Deputy Director for Operations I was responsible for all external facing\n\noperations, including Healthcare.gov, and internal operations including, personnel, contracts,\n\nbudgets, and facilities for CCIIO. In this role, I was responsible for supervising eight group\n\ndirectors and a support office, who in turn oversaw CCIIO\u2019s more than 600 employees, including\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 4-36       Filed 03/07/25      Page 3 of 7\n\n\n\n82 who were initially identified as probationary employees.1\n\n6.     Beginning after January 20, 2025, the CMS Chief Human Capital Officer (CHCO) asked\n\nCMS center directors to evaluate their probationary employees and determine any that should be\n\nremoved from service.\n\n7.     Thereafter, a manager within the CMS Office of Human Capital (OHC) followed up to\n\nrequest updates on a daily basis regarding which probationary employees should be removed from\n\nservice. This was unusual because in my experience OHC had never proactively inquired about\n\nwhether particular probationary employees should be retained, and certainly not on a daily basis.\n\nOHC explained that their ongoing requests for information about probationary employees were at\n\nthe request of the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\n8.     In accordance with the direction from the CMS CHCO, I met with group directors who\n\nreported to me and communicated to them that they should identify for removal all probationary\n\nemployees with any performance issues, even those with marginal performance issues that in other\n\ncircumstances would not have resulted in their termination.\n\n9.     The group of directors uniformly assured me that none of the probationary employees in\n\nCCIIO should be removed from service because their performance uniformly met and typically\n\nexceeded the expectations and needs of the agency for probationary employees. Accordingly, I did\n\nnot identify to OHC any probationary employees at CCIIO who should be removed from service.\n\n10.    At or about 11:00 a.m. on February 14, 2025, the Deputy Chief Operating Officer of CMS\n\nconvened an emergency meeting of CMS\u2019s Strategic Planning and Management Council, which\n\nis a coordinating body for all of the non-political center directors, deputy center directors, and\n\n\n\n\n1\n Although 82 employees were initially identified as probationary employees, approximately 10\nof these employees were not ultimately determined not to be probationary.\n                                                2\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 4-36         Filed 03/07/25   Page 4 of 7\n\n\n\ncareer civil service officials leading offices at CMS.\n\n11.    This Strategic Planning and Management Council meeting was conducted by Zoom.\n\nDuring the meeting, Stephanie Bovell, CHCO of CMS reported that at 1:00 pm that day, all\n\nprobationary employees at CMS would begin to be terminated, effective later that afternoon, a\n\nprocess that would run between 1:00 and 4:00 pm that day. Ms. Bovell informed the meeting that\n\nthe HHS CHCO had informed her and all other HHS Agency CHCOs of the decision to terminate\n\nall probationary employees during a call the previous evening. Ms. Bovell further explained that\n\nthe HHS CHCO informed the Agency CHCOs that probationary employees would be terminated\n\nen masse via letters that would say that the employees\u2019 unsatisfactory performance was the reason\n\nfor removal. Ms. Bovell stated that she and other HHS Agency CHCOs had told the HHS CHCO\n\nduring the February 13 call that they did not believe that the proposed termination letters were a\n\nlegitimate basis for the mass terminations of probationary employees because there was no basis\n\nfor the reasons stated in the letter. Ms. Bovell stated during the meeting that although the\n\nterminations were going forward it was unclear at the time of the Strategic Planning and\n\nManagement Council meeting whether the Agency CHCOs\u2019 feedback would result in HHS\n\nchanging the reasons for termination given in the letters.\n\n12.    During a 4:00 p.m. all-managers meeting at CMS, Ms. Bovell informed CMS managers\n\nthat the termination letters had not yet been distributed to probationary employees, and it was\n\nunclear when the terminations would take place.\n\n13.    On the morning of February 15, 2025, CMS distributed near-identical form termination\n\nletters to probationary employees across CMS, including 82 employees at CCIIO.2 No CCIIO\n\n\n\n2\n  As explained above in note 1, CMS subsequently determined that approximately 10 of these\nemployees were not in fact probationary employees, and it has subsequently rescinded the\nterminations of those non-probationary employees.\n                                                 3\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB             Document 4-36     Filed 03/07/25      Page 5 of 7\n\n\n\nmanagers were copied on the letters that terminated the probationary employees who worked for\n\nus, including their direct line supervisors who ordinarily would be aware of any adverse personnel\n\naction taken against any direct report.\n\n14.    These termination letters purported to justify the terminations of probationary employees\n\nby saying, \u201cUnfortunately, the Agency finds that you are not fit for continued employment because\n\nyour ability, knowledge, and skills do not fit the Agency\u2019s current needs, and your performance\n\nhas not been adequate to justify further employment at the agency.\u201d The justifications written in\n\nthese termination letters were false.\n\n15.    All of the probationary employees at CCIIO who received the February 15, 2025\n\ntermination letter were hired into positions that were tailored to the agency\u2019s needs. Specifically,\n\nevery position approved during the last few years, including every position filled by one of the\n\nprobationary employees terminated on February 15, had undergone a formal review, first by me,\n\nthen by CMS\u2019s Enterprise Workforce Investment Council (EWIC), and ultimately by CMS\u2019s Chief\n\nOperating Officer (COO). My review of these positions was to ensure that they aligned with the\n\npriorities and needs of CCIIO. EWIC\u2019s review was to ensure that the positions aligned with the\n\nagency\u2019s needs. And the COO reviewed the EWIC\u2019s recommendations to ensure that the senior\n\nofficial in charge of our human capital strategy was aware of and agreed with our assessments.\n\n16.    Every one of the terminated probationary employees had the knowledge, skills, and\n\nabilities that CCIIO required to accomplish our work and that met the specific requirements of the\n\npositions for which we hired them. In selecting these individuals, we reviewed between one and\n\ntwo thousand resumes, many of which came from other fully qualified people. We chose the best\n\nfrom hundreds of very highly qualified candidates. I personally interviewed at least a third of these\n\ncandidates. I reviewed their resumes. They were truly the best of the best. They had exceptional\n\n\n\n                                                 4\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 4-36        Filed 03/07/25    Page 6 of 7\n\n\n\nknowledge, skills, and ability as measured against the work we asked them to perform.\n\n17.    The termination letters were also false because they were not in fact based on any\n\nevaluation of the individual probationary employees\u2019 performance. I am lucky to have witnessed\n\nthe incredible performance of some of the probationary employees who had been with us the\n\nlongest. They personally briefed me on their work. I talked about their performance with their\n\nmanagers. Many of these workers received the highest possible performance ratings, with these\n\nratings having been completed within a month of their being terminated, ostensibly for inadequate\n\nperformance. The HHS CHCO could have obtained data from the system to assess the CCIIO\n\nprobationary employees\u2019 performance, and if he had done so, he would have seen that the\n\nemployees\u2019 performance was outstanding.\n\n18.    Some of the terminated probationary employees did not have the minimum 90 days on the\n\njob that HHS\u2019s Performance Management Appraisal Program requires prior to making any formal\n\nperformance assessment, and under HHS personnel rules, management may not make a\n\nperformance-based termination prior to actually evaluating those employees\u2019 performance.\n\n19.    The mass terminations of probationary employees at CCIIO were not based on any\n\nindividualized assessment of the probationary employees. The CMS CHCO did not review the\n\npositions for suitability, never read a single person\u2019s resume, never spoke with any of the\n\nterminated probationary employees, and had no personal knowledge of their individual\n\nperformance. Having actually reviewed the knowledge, skills, and abilities of these probationary\n\nemployees and having observed their performance and having been briefed on their performance\n\nevaluations, I can state with confidence that none of the probationary employees\u2019 terminations at\n\nCCIIO were justified by the reasons stated in the termination letters.\n\n20.    In addition, the terminations of probationary employees were not justified by the fact that\n\n\n\n                                                 5\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB   Document 4-36   Filed 03/07/25   Page 7 of 7\n\f",

My name is Traci DiMartini and I am an adult resident of Gaithersburg, Maryland.\n\n       2.      I served as a Human Capital Officer for the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) until\n\nMarch 3, 2025, when the IRS put me on administrative leave. The IRS is the largest bureau within\n\nthe Department of Treasury (\u201cTreasury\u201d).\n\n       3.      I am a career civil servant and have worked for the federal government for over 21\n\nyears, including at the Departments of Labor, Education, Interior, and Agriculture, as well as the\n\nOffice of Personnel Management (\u201cOPM\u201d). I was sworn in as a member of the Senior Executive\n\nService in 2016 and since that time, I have served as a Chief Human Capital Officer at the Equal\n\nEmployment Opportunity Commission, Peace Corps, the General Services Administration, and the\n\nIRS, where I served as the Human Capital Officer from June 2023 to March 2025. I have worked\n\nunder both Democratic and Republican administrations.\n\n\n\n\n                                                1\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 4-37       Filed 03/07/25      Page 3 of 9\n\n\n\n       4.      During my time as the Human Capital Officer for the IRS, I was the Senior\n\nExecutive responsible for overseeing all Human Capital operations at the IRS.\n\n       5.      After President Trump took office on January 20, 2025, OPM issued guidance\n\ninstructing agencies to terminate probationary employees. Around the first week of February,\n\nshortly following OPM\u2019s issuance of this guidance, the Chief Human Capital Officer for Treasury,\n\nTrevor Norris, instructed my office to begin terminating probationary employees at the IRS.\n\nSpecifically, he instructed me to identify all probationary employees at the IRS and terminate all\n\nof them \u201cbased on performance.\u201d\n\n       6.      In all my decades of human resource management for the federal government, I had\n\nnever before received a directive such as this one. Typically, the decision to terminate a\n\nprobationary employee lies solely with the probationary employee\u2019s manager. Even then, the\n\ncircumstances under which you can terminate a probationary employee are limited to instances\n\nwhere: (1) the employee is failing to meet the basic requirements of the job, or (2) the employee\n\nengages in highly inappropriate conduct while on the job. In any scenario, the poor performance\n\nor conduct must be evaluated and documented.\n\n       7.      Further, I have never heard of mass probationary employee firings. Because the\n\nbasis for any probationary employee termination is a highly individualized determination,\n\nterminating probationary employees on a large scale has never been done, to my knowledge.\n\n       8.      I attended several virtual meetings with Trevor Norris and other Human Capital\n\nOfficers at Treasury agencies (which include the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the\n\nBureau of Engraving and Printing, and the U.S. Mint) during which we discussed the directive to\n\nconduct mass terminations of probationary employees. The other agency Human Capital Officers\n\n\n\n\n                                                2\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 4-37        Filed 03/07/25      Page 4 of 9\n\n\n\nand I asked Mr. Norris why Treasury was directing us to terminate probationary employees, and\n\nMr. Norris informed us that it was what OPM \u201cwants to do.\u201d\n\n       9.       We also asked whether the terminations were legal. Mr. Norris explained that OPM\n\nwas taking the position that the probationary period of employment was an \u201cextension of the\n\napplication process.\u201d In my experience, this is never how probationary employment has been\n\nviewed and, candidly, makes no sense.\n\n       10.      Mr. Norris informed us that Charles Ezell, the Acting Director of OPM, Amanda\n\nScales, Mr. Ezell\u2019s Chief of Staff, and Noah Peters, were the individuals spearheading the\n\ntermination of probationary employees at OPM. All three are political appointees and, as I\n\nunderstand it, they do not have civil service staff assisting them in this process. OPM was\n\ncommunicating these directives to the political appointees at Treasury, including Mr. York and\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who were passing the directives down to Mr. Norris and the\n\nother Human Capital Officers at Treasury agencies.\n\n       11.      To comply with OPM\u2019s directive to Treasury, my office pulled an initial list of\n\n17,000 probationary employees. We carved out employees from the Taxpayer Services, Taxpayer\n\nAdvocate, and IT departments, all of whom are essential personnel for tax filing season, as well as\n\nsome other categories of workers, resulting in a list of approximately 6,700 probationary\n\nemployees located around the country.\n\n       12.      Mr. Norris specifically instructed me and the other Human Capital Officers at\n\nTreasury that OPM would not allow us to exempt military veterans from the probationary\n\nterminations.\n\n       13.      My colleagues and I asked Mr. Norris what the termination letter for affected\n\nprobationary employees should consist of, and they informed me that OPM had drafted a letter,\n\n\n\n\n                                                3\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 4-37        Filed 03/07/25     Page 5 of 9\n\n\n\nTreasury made a few modifications, and that we were instructed to send this letter out. My office\n\nwas not permitted to make any changes to the letter. I refused to sign these termination notices, as\n\ndid Acting IRS Commissioner Doug O\u2019Donnell, so the termination notices were sent on February\n\n14, 2025 from a generic agency email to approximately 6,700 probationary employees at IRS,\n\nterminating their employment immediately.\n\n       14.     My office did not review or consider the actual job performance or conduct of any\n\nIRS probationary employee when issuing the termination notices. I also know that Treasury did\n\nnot review or consider the actual job performance or conduct of any IRS probationary employee\n\nwhen issuing the termination notices. I know this because this fact was discussed openly in\n\nmeetings. Practically speaking, it would take weeks or months to evaluate the job performance of\n\n6,700 probationary employees.\n\n       15.     Although I did not review the personnel files of any of these employees, it is a\n\nstatistical certainty in my mind that many of the nearly 6,700 probationary employees terminated\n\nby IRS had written documentation of positive performance.\n\n       16.     The OPM directive, communicated to me by Mr. York through Mr. Norris, was\n\nplainly an effort to reduce headcount and did not involve any evaluation of the job performance of\n\nprobationary employees.\n\n       17.     To me, the mass firings were clearly a Reduction in Force (\u201cRIF\u201d) without\n\nfollowing the rules for a RIF.\n\n       18.     To ensure that a RIF is conducted lawfully, an agency spends approximately 12 to\n\n18 months simply preparing for the RIF. See Exhibit 1 (Reduction in Force (RIF) Fact Sheet). An\n\nagency\u2019s Human Capital office begins by spending months verifying that personnel records are\n\ncomplete and free of errors. This is to ensure, for example, that veterans\u2019 status is correctly\n\n\n\n\n                                                 4\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 4-37         Filed 03/07/25      Page 6 of 9\n\n\n\nannotated and that employees\u2019 service date computations are correct, among other things. The\n\nagency then typically takes months to determine the competitive area where the RIF will take\n\nplace. After these and other initial steps are taken, the agency will then try to reassign employees\n\nto other divisions or give them an opportunity to take an early retirement offer instead of separating\n\nthem in a RIF. These effort are made in close consultation with the managers in these offices. The\n\nRIF is the last step of the process, which must be done in accordance with required RIF procedures,\n\nincluding providing employees and their unions with notice. Notice to employees is critical\n\nbecause it allows them to make preparations and minimize the devastating impact of losing a job.\n\nI understand that an agency is also required to give notice to the state where an affected employee\u2019s\n\nduty station was located.\n\n       19.     On or about February 25, 2025, Acting IRS Commissioner O\u2019Donnell retired, and\n\nMelanie Krause, previously the Chief Operating Officer of the IRS, became Acting Commissioner\n\nof the IRS.\n\n       20.     On Friday, February 28, 2025, Gavin Kliger, a member of the Department of\n\nGovernment Efficiency (DOGE), arrived at the IRS around 12:30, along with Sam Cronus a new,\n\nunpaid political advisor to Tom Krause, a Treasury political appointee. Mr. Kliger demanded that\n\nMr. Cronus be issued an IRS personal identity verification card and information technology\n\nequipment immediately. I informed the Chief of Staff via email that that Mr. Kliger\u2019s request\n\nwould not be completed that day because: (1) the necessary paperwork to onboard him was not\n\nprepared because we did not have advance notice that he was starting; (2) any new IRS employee\n\nmust undergo a tax check and that can take up to 10 days to complete; and (3) Treasury is required\n\nto comply with a Temporary Restraining Order issued by the U.S. District Court for the Southern\n\n\n\n\n                                                  5\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 4-37        Filed 03/07/25     Page 7 of 9\n\n\n\nDistrict of New York, which limits access to Treasury systems without prior approval and written\n\nagreement executed by our General Counsel.\n\n       21.     Accordingly, I scheduled Mr. Cronus\u2019 onboarding to take place as soon as possible,\n\nwhich was the next business day, Monday, March 3, 2025 at 8:00 a.m. I notified my staff that we\n\nhad a political appointee to process for onboarding and to be ready with the appropriate paperwork.\n\nI also notified our General Counsel\u2019s office to arrange for an ethics briefing and the Chief Privacy\n\nofficer to request a briefing for Mr. Cronus on the confidentiality and information security\n\nrequirements of Internal Revenue Code section 6103.\n\n       22.     On Saturday, March 1, 2025, Acting Commissioner Krause contacted me and\n\nrequested that I complete a tax check on Mr. Cronus, the DOGE employee, that day. I do not\n\npersonally conduct the tax check, and the tax checks are not performed on the weekends. I\n\ninformed Ms. Krause that we could conduct it on Monday morning. Ms. Krause stated that I was\n\nbeing uncooperative and that, in essence, I was expected to jump if DOGE told me to jump. I\n\nsimply responded that we were following established processes and protocols.\n\n       23.     On the morning of Monday, March 3, 2025, we had arranged for Mr. Cronus, the\n\nDOGE employee, to undergo the tax check at 8:00am, but he did not arrive at our offices until\n\n10:45am. That afternoon, Acting Commissioner Krause placed me on administrative leave with\n\nthe intention of terminating my employment as a career Senior Executive. Acting Commissioner\n\nKrause gave three reasons for placing me on administrative leave pending termination: (1) that I\n\ndid not effectively implement the termination of probationary employees; (2) that I did not\n\nimplement the deferred resignation program correctly; and (3) that I was insubordinate and\n\nuncooperative with the DOGE employees.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 6\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB         Document 4-37        Filed 03/07/25     Page 8 of 9\n\n\n\n       24.    Following my meeting with Acting Commissioner Krause, security escorted me to\n\nmy office where I was asked to turn over my government ID, my government issued laptop,\n\niPhone, iPad, and parking pass. I was then escorted to my car and left the premises by 3:00 PM.\n\n\n\n\n        March 6, 2025\nDated: _______________                              Signed: ___________________________\n                                                           Traci DiMartini\n\n                                                    *A copy of the signature page bearing an\n                                                    original signature is attached hereto.\n\n\n\n\n                                               7\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB   Document 4-37   Filed 03/07/25   Page 9 of 9\n\f",

LIERMAN, declare as follows:\n   1. I am a resident of the State of Maryland. I am over the age of 18 and have personal\nknowledge of all the facts stated herein, except to those matters stated upon information and belief;\nas to those matters, I believe them to be true. If called as a witness, I could and would testify\ncompetently to the matters set forth below.\n   2. I currently serve as the Comptroller of Maryland (\u201cComptroller\u201d).\n   3. The Comptroller is the chief fiscal officer of the State. My duties as Comptroller include\nthe following: having the general superintendence of the fiscal affairs of the State; digesting and\npreparing plans for the improvement and management of the revenue and for the support of the\npublic credit; preparing and reporting estimates of the revenue and expenditures of the State;\nsuperintending and enforcing the prompt collection of all taxes and revenue; adjusting and settling,\non terms prescribed by law, with delinquent collectors and receivers of taxes and State revenue;\npreserving all public accounts; and deciding on the forms of keeping and stating accounts. See MD\nConstitution, Art. 6, \u00a7 2.\n   4. Maryland\u2019s budget relies in large part on personal income tax revenue. In fiscal year 2024,\npersonal income tax revenue represented 55% of our general fund revenues.\n   5. Although unemployed individuals receiving unemployment benefits generally pay income\ntax on their benefits, the benefits paid are less than the amount the individuals earned when they\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 4-38        Filed 03/07/25      Page 3 of 3\n\n\n\nwere fully employed, and therefore the taxes paid are generally less than the taxes paid during their\nemployment.\n   6. Accordingly, any firings and layoffs causing Marylanders to become unemployed will\nnecessarily result in a significant decrease to Maryland income tax revenues.\n   7. Upon information and belief, I understand that hundreds of federal employees who reside\nin Maryland and were recently terminated by the federal government have applied for\nunemployment benefits.\n   8. Accordingly, the terminations that have occurred to date and the anticipated continuation\nof these terminations will cause significant decreases in Maryland\u2019s income tax revenues.\n   9. Approximately 250,000 federal workers reside in Maryland.\n   10. Beyond the loss of income tax revenue, the sudden and significant increase of newly\nunemployed workers will have serious negative effects on Maryland\u2019s labor market. These effects\ninclude extended periods of unemployment, downward pressure on wages, and the migration of\nresidents out of the State.\n\n\n\nExecuted on March 6, 2025, at Annapolis, Maryland.\n\n\n\n\n                                              _____________________________________\n                                              BROOKE E.

I am a resident of the State of Colorado. I am over the age of 18 and have\n\npersonal knowledge of all the facts stated herein, except to those matters stated upon information\n\nand belief; as to those matters, I believe them to be true. If called as a witness, I could and would\n\ntestify competently to the matters set forth below.\n\n       2.      I am currently employed by the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment\n\n(CDLE) as the Director of the Colorado Division of Unemployment Insurance.\n\n       3.      CDLE is responsible for connecting job seekers to great jobs; protecting\n\nworkplaces and communities with a variety of consumer protection and safety programs;\n\nassisting workers injured on the job; ensuring fair labor practices; providing accurate economic\n\ndata; and helping those who lost their jobs by providing temporary wage replacement. CDLE\n\nadministers a wide range of federally funded workforce and training programs, including but not\n\n\n\n                                                   1\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 4-39       Filed 03/07/25     Page 3 of 9\n\n\n\nlimited to those authorized by the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), that are\n\nvital to Colorado\u2019s economic stability and workforce development.\n\n       4.       As Director of the Colorado Division of Unemployment Insurance, I have access\n\nto records that detail the state of Colorado\u2019s labor market, including claims for unemployment\n\nbenefits, and the allocation and distribution of funding received by CDLE.\n\n       5.       The ongoing mass-layoff of federal workers is irreparably harming Colorado in\n\nseveral ways.\n\nRapid Response Team Expenditures\n\n       6.       CDLE oversees Rapid Response, a coordinated, multiple-partner strategy to\n\nprovide immediate assistance to Coloradans subject to mass layoffs. Rapid Response is the state\n\nentity responsible for conducting outreach and providing unemployment services required by the\n\nfederal Workforce Investment Act of 1998, as amended by the federal Workforce Innovation and\n\nOpportunity Act of 2014.\n\n       7.       The purpose of Rapid Response is to reduce reliance on public benefit systems\n\nsuch as unemployment insurance; to promote economic recovery and vitality by developing an\n\nongoing, comprehensive approach to identify, plan for, and respond to layoffs and dislocations;\n\nand to prevent or minimize the impact of mass layoffs on workers, businesses, and communities.\n\n       8.       At the core of our Rapid Response team is CDLE\u2019s Dislocated Worker Unit\n\n(DSU). DSU works in close partnership with other stakeholders, such as the state\u2019s ten Local\n\nWorkforce Development Areas, which provide localized assistance to both employers and\n\nemployees across the state.\n\n       9.       When notified of a forthcoming mass layoff, Rapid Response will quickly provide\n\ninformational resources and reemployment services for workers, including but not limited to:\n\n\n\n                                                2\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 4-39          Filed 03/07/25      Page 4 of 9\n\n\n\ninformation and support for filing Unemployment Insurance (UI) claims, information on the\n\nimpacts of layoffs on health coverage or other benefits, information on and referral to career\n\nservices, reemployment-focused workshops and services, and occupational training.\n\n        10.     In addition, Rapid Response will contact affected businesses to collect, verify, and\n\ndistribute information regarding Rapid Response activities. Rapid Response will also coordinate\n\nwith state staff and local workforce area staff at the American Job Centers located in the affected\n\narea to provide support for the affected workers. The Division of Unemployment Insurance will\n\nmobilize to streamline and expedite the processing of unemployment claims.\n\n        11.     Rapid Response also facilitates connections to partner agencies and organizations\n\nto ensure their ability to provide assistance to terminated workers and their families, such as\n\nhome heating assistance, legal aid, and financial advice.\n\n        12.     I understand that, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d)(3)(A)(i), the federal\n\nGovernment is required to notify \u201cthe State or entity designated by the State to carry out rapid\n\nresponse activities under section 134(a)(2)(A) of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998\u201d of a\n\nplan for a reduction-in-force (RIF) of federal employees, generally at least 60 days in advance of\n\nany proposed RIF.\n\n        13.     The notice required by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d)(3)(A) is intended to trigger rapid\n\nresponse activities since it is explicitly to be given to the state entity required to carry out rapid\n\nresponse activities.\n\n        14.     To the best of my knowledge, neither CDLE, Rapid Response, nor any other\n\nentity in the Colorado State Government has received notice of a federal reduction in force at any\n\nfederal agency.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   3\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 4-39        Filed 03/07/25      Page 5 of 9\n\n\n\n       15.     Yet, as detailed more below, since January 21, 2025, CDLE has already received\n\n544 claims from ex-federal workers who list a federal agency as their last employer. This is\n\ncompared to 135 claims from ex-federal workers who list a federal agency as their last employer\n\nfor the same time period one year ago. CDLE has also seen a significant uptick of new\n\nunemployment claims of ex-federal employees just in the last two weeks, with an approximate\n\nrange of 20-30 new such claims every day. CDLE has been receiving substantially more\n\nunemployment claims of ex-federal employees than in past years.\n\n       16.     Because our Rapid Response team has received no notice of federal RIFs, CDLE\n\nhas been required to dedicate significantly more staff, resources, and expenditures to fulfill our\n\nstatutory mission. In light of the increasing claims for unemployment benefits and the public\n\nreporting about ongoing and forthcoming federal layoffs, Rapid Response has been attempting to\n\ncompensate for the lack of notice and information regarding the terminations. Rapid Response\n\nhas been conducting substantial outreach across the state, including issuing revised guidance\n\ndocuments. CDLE has been conducting town halls and engaging with elected officials and other\n\nstakeholders to provide information and engage with individuals regarding the resources\n\ndescribed above. We have internally had to divert staff from other critical tasks to monitor and\n\ndevelop reporting dashboards in response to these unprecedented federal terminations. These\n\nsubstantial efforts and expenditures would not have been necessary had the federal agencies\n\nproperly provided the notice required by law.\n\nHarms Related to the Colorado Unemployment Insurance Act\n\n       17.     CDLE, through the Division of Unemployment Insurance, also manages claims\n\nfor unemployment benefits by individuals formerly employed to work in Colorado.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 4\n\f      Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 4-39        Filed 03/07/25      Page 6 of 9\n\n\n\n       18.     The statutory framework of the Colorado Unemployment Insurance Act (the Act)\n\nis primarily governed by the Colorado Employment Security Act (CESA), which is codified at\n\nTitle 8, Sections 8-70-101 through 8-82-105, C.R.S.\n\n       19.     Colorado is party to an agreement with the United States Secretary of Labor,\n\nwherein the Secretary shall pay, as an agent of the United States, Unemployment Compensation\n\nfor Federal Employees (UCFE) pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8502(a). Generally, the federal\n\nGovernment is required to reimburse Colorado for unemployment benefits provided to former\n\nfederal employees, in the same amount, on the same terms, and subject to the same conditions\n\nwhich would be payable to them under the Act. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8502(b). These insurance benefits are\n\ngenerally payable for up to twenty-six (26) weeks. C.R.S. \u00a7 8-73-104.\n\n       20.     The Act is designed to provide unemployment benefits to individuals who are\n\nunemployed through no fault of their own and to ensure the fair and efficient administration of\n\nthese benefits. C.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 8-70-102 & 8-73-108(1)(a).\n\n       21.     The Act does not define \u201cfault\u201d but in the context of unemployment benefits,\n\ncourts have defined \u201cfault\u201d as \u201crequiring a volitional act or the exercise of some control or choice\n\nby the claimant in the circumstances resulting in the separation such that the claimant can be said\n\nto be responsible for the separation.\u201d Mesa Cnty. Pub. Libr. Dist. v. Indus. Claim Appeals Off.,\n\n396 P.3d 1114, 1119 (Colo. 2017) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).\n\n       22.     An individual in Colorado who wishes to collect unemployment insurance\n\nbenefits must register for work and file a claim for benefits in accordance with applicable\n\nstatutes and regulations. C.R.S. \u00a7 8-74-101; 7 CCR 1101-2.\n\n       23.     At the time of separation, the employer must provide the employee, in writing,\n\ninformation regarding the availability of unemployment compensation benefits, which must\n\n\n\n                                                 5\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 4-39        Filed 03/07/25        Page 7 of 9\n\n\n\ninclude the (1) employer\u2019s name and address; (2) employee\u2019s name and address; (3) employee\u2019s\n\nidentification number or the last four numbers of the employee\u2019s social security number; (4)\n\nemployee\u2019s start date, date of last day worked, year-to-date earnings, and wages for the last week\n\nthe employee worked; and (5) reason the employee separated from the employer. C.R.S. \u00a7 8-74-\n\n101.\n\n       24.     Upon receipt of a claim, the Division of Unemployment Insurance must notify\n\ninterested parties of the claim. C.R.S. \u00a7 8-74-102(1). Interested parties are afforded an\n\nopportunity to present information pertinent to the claim. Id. A deputy, as assigned by the\n\nDirector of the Division, will review the material and issue a decision that sets forth findings of\n\nfact, conclusions of law, and an order. Id.\n\n       25.     Any interested party that is dissatisfied with a deputy\u2019s decision may appeal the\n\ndecisions within twenty calendar days after the date of notification of the decision and will be\n\nafforded a hearing. C.R.S. \u00a7 8-74-103(1). A hearing officer will afford interested parties a\n\nreasonable opportunity for a fair hearing, and thereafter, will decide each relevant issue raised,\n\nincluding findings of fact, conclusions of law, and an issued an order. Id. \u00a7 8-74-103(3).\n\n       26.     Throughout this process, the Division must consider the circumstances of a\n\nperson\u2019s separation \u201cin determining the amount of benefits he [or she] may receive,\u201d and must\n\nalso take into account \u201cthat certain acts of individuals are the direct and proximate cause of their\n\nunemployment, and such acts may result in such individuals receiving a disqualification\u201d from\n\nunemployment benefits. C.R.S. \u00a7 8-73-108(1)(a); see Debalco Enters., Inc. v. Indus. Claim\n\nAppeals Office, 32 P.3d 621, 623 (Colo. App. 2001) (whether a claimant is entitled to benefits\n\ndepends on the reason for separation) (citing \u00a7 8-73-108(1)(a), (4), & (5)(e)).\n\n\n\n\n                                                 6\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 4-39        Filed 03/07/25    Page 8 of 9\n\n\n\n       27.     The current situation involving the mass termination of probationary federal\n\nemployees is causing, and will continue to cause, significant harms to Colorado associated with\n\nthe processing of unemployment claims. Many federal employees received termination notices\n\nsuggesting that they were fired for performance reasons, for example, because their performance\n\nhas not been adequate to justify further employment at the federal agency. As a result, the\n\nDivision of Unemployment Insurance is required to investigate and make findings whether these\n\nindividuals are eligible for benefits when, as noted above, Colorado state law limits benefits to\n\nthose who are unemployed through no fault of their own. These inquiries are often resource\n\nintensive and will require the Division to make individualized determinations in each case as to\n\nthe real reasons for the termination.\n\n       28.      The resources necessary to undertake these individualized investigations for\n\nformer federal employees is a substantial burden on CDLE. It will cause the diversion of staffing\n\nto investigate these claims. This will likely cause delays and backlogs for other unemployment\n\nclaims within the state. Colorado will be required to expend these substantial additional\n\nresources with no guarantee that it will be reimbursed for these expenses by the federal\n\ngovernment.\n\n\n\n\n               Executed on March 6, 2025, at Denver, Colorado.\n\n\n\n\n                                         ____/s/*_______\n                                         Philip Spesshardt\n                                         Director, Colorado Division of Unemployment Insurance\n\n               *A copy of the signature page bearing an original signature is attached hereto.\n\n                                                 7\n\fCase 1:25-cv-00748-JKB   Document 4-39   Filed 03/07/25   Page 9 of 9\n\f",

President Trump and his Administration have made no secret of their contempt for the\n\nroughly 2 million committed professionals who form the federal civil service. Nor have they\n\ndisguised their plans to terminate vast numbers of civil servants, starting with tens of thousands of\n\nprobationary employees. These large-scale, indiscriminate firings are not only subjecting the\n\nPlaintiff States and communities across the country to chaos. They are also against the law.\n\n2.     Federal statutes and regulations set forth procedures that federal agencies must follow\n\nwhen conducting reductions in force (\u201cRIFs\u201d). Critically, these procedures require that federal\n\nagencies provide 60 days of advance notice to affected employees and to states, so that they have\n\nan opportunity to mitigate the harms of layoffs. Where an agency fails to provide such notice, the\n\nemployees \u201cmay not be released.\u201d\n\n3.     Over the past month, the new Administration has run roughshod over the RIF requirements.\n\nSpecifically, as part of an effort to reduce the size of the federal workforce, the Office of Personnel\n\nManagement (\u201cOPM\u201d) has unlawfully directed federal agencies to conduct mass terminations of\n\nprobationary employees, suddenly and without any advance notice. Defendants have followed\n\nthrough on this directive, firing employees by the hundreds and, in many instances, thousands\u2014\n\nall without following the procedures for conducting RIFs and without providing notice to the\n\naffected employees or states.\n\n4.     This campaign has inflicted immense harms on tens of thousands of probationary\n\nemployees and their families. It has rendered them jobless without providing any advance notice\n\n\n\n                                                  8\n\f        Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 1        Filed 03/06/25      Page 9 of 55\n\n\n\nthat might have given them an opportunity to seek other employment or even budget to prepare\n\nfor the loss of income. As a result, many affected employees and their families are struggling to\n\nmake ends meet\u2014to pay rent, buy groceries, and care for their loved ones.\n\n5.     This campaign is harming Plaintiff States, too. In addition to the informational and\n\nprocedural injuries resulting from the deprivation of notice to which they were entitled, the lack of\n\nnotice has impeded the ability of many Plaintiff States to support affected employees and thereby\n\nmitigate the financial and other impacts on state services. In fact, pursuant to federal statutory\n\nrequirements, Plaintiff States operate rapid response teams that provide immediate services and\n\nresources to workers subject to mass layoffs. These services include job placement and job training\n\nservices as well as connections to social services like unemployment insurance and health\n\ninsurance. Because of Defendants\u2019 failure to adhere to the RIF notice procedures, many Plaintiff\n\nStates have had to scramble and expend additional resources to identify even which agencies have\n\nconducted layoffs and which affected employees require support.\n\n6.     Because of the lack of notice, many Plaintiff States have also faced increased\n\nadministrative demands related to adjudicating unemployment claims; decreased tax revenues; and\n\nincreased demands for social services. Some Plaintiff States have also lost the benefit of services\n\nprovided by federal employees embedded within state agencies, without any time to prepare.\n\n7.     To address these harms to Plaintiff States, this action seeks declaratory and injunctive relief\n\nrequiring Defendants: to cease the RIFs of probationary employees that they have conducted\n\nunlawfully and without notice; to reinstate any probationary employees who were terminated as\n\npart of mass terminations on or after January 20, 2025; to refrain from separating any employees\n\npursuant to a RIF prior to reinstatement of the unlawfully terminated probationary employees; and\n\n\n\n\n                                                 9\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB            Document 1       Filed 03/06/25      Page 10 of 55\n\n\n\nto conduct any future RIFs in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, including providing\n\nrequired notices to Plaintiff States.\n\n                              I.        JURISDICTION AND VENUE\n\n8.      This Court has jurisdiction over this Complaint under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361,\n\nand 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702.\n\n9.

Federal workers reside and work in each of the Plaintiff States. The Defendants have\n\nconducted\u2014or have announced plans to imminently conduct\u2014illegal RIFs by firing probationary\n\nemployees in Plaintiff States without adhering to the statutory and regulatory requirements for\n\nconducting RIFs.\n\n                                III.    LEGAL FRAMEWORK\n\nA.     Probationary Employees\n\n75.    OPM\u2019s directive to agencies to terminate probationary employees en masse has swept up\n\ntwo categories of federal employees whose employment is governed by statute and regulation:\n\nprobationary employees in the \u201ccompetitive\u201d service, and employees within their first two years\n\nof employment in the \u201cexcepted\u201d service. Competitive service employees are hired through an\n\nopen, competitive hiring process and excepted service employees are appointed through a non-\n\ncompetitive hiring process. Plaintiff States refer herein to all such employees as \u201cprobationary\n\nemployees.\u201d\n\n76.    Probationary employees in the competitive service are, with some exceptions, those who\n\nhave been employed for less than one year. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7511(a)(1)(A)(ii); 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.801.\n\n77.    Employees are appointed as \u201ccareer\u201d or \u201ccareer-conditional employees\u201d subject to\n\ncompleting the probationary period. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.201(a).\n\n78.    The probationary period provides the opportunity for the federal agency to assess the\n\nindividual performance of the employee. Under governing OPM regulations, an agency \u201cshall\n\nutilize the probationary period as fully as possible to determine the fitness of the employee and\n\n\n\n\n                                                 19\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 1        Filed 03/06/25      Page 20 of 55\n\n\n\nshall terminate his or her services during this period if the employee fails to demonstrate fully his\n\nor her qualifications for continued employment.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.803(a).\n\n79.    Most employees in the excepted service are also subject to a statutory trial period of two\n\nyears, which, like the probationary period in the competitive service, is intended to permit the\n\nagency to evaluate the employee\u2019s performance and fitness for long-term employment. 5 U.S.C.\n\n\u00a7 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii).\n\n80.    Outside of the context of a RIF, federal agencies may lawfully terminate probationary\n\nemployees for one of two reasons.\n\n81.    First, a federal agency may lawfully terminate a probationary employee for reasons based\n\non conditions arising before the employee\u2019s probationary appointment. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.805.\n\n82.    Second, a federal agency may lawfully terminate a probationary employee based on the\n\nagency\u2019s assessment of the employee\u2019s performance during the probationary period, pursuant to 5\n\nC.F.R. \u00a7 315.804(a), which is entitled: \u201cTermination of probationers for unsatisfactory\n\nperformance or conduct.\u201d\n\n83.    Under that regulation, \u201cwhen an agency decides to terminate an employee serving a\n\nprobationary or trial period because his work performance or conduct during this period fails to\n\ndemonstrate his fitness or his qualifications for continued employment, it shall terminate his\n\nservices by notifying him in writing as to why he is being separated and the effective date of the\n\naction.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.804(a). \u201cThe information in the notice as to why the employee is being\n\nterminated shall, as a minimum, consist of the agency\u2019s conclusions as to the inadequacies of his\n\nperformance or conduct.\u201d Id. Trial-period employees in the excepted service have the same notice\n\nrights when removed from their positions for performance reasons. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 316.304.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 20\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 1       Filed 03/06/25     Page 21 of 55\n\n\n\nB.     RIF Requirements\n\n84.    Apart from terminations of probationary employees for conditions arising before their\n\nappointments or for unsatisfactory performance or conduct, federal agencies may only terminate\n\nprobationary employees as part of an agency RIF.\n\n85.    A reduction-in-force \u201cis an administrative procedure by which agencies eliminate jobs and\n\nreassign or separate employees who occupied the abolished positions. A RIF is not an adverse\n\naction against a particular employee, but is directed solely at a position within an agency.\u201d James\n\nv. Von Zemenszky, 284 F.3d 1310, 1314 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (citation omitted); Schall v. U.S. Postal\n\nServ., 73 F.3d 341, 344 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (similar).\n\n86.    An agency must follow specific statutory directives in conducting a RIF, including\n\nfollowing the retention preferences in the statute, giving preference to the retention of military\n\nveterans, and considering the employee\u2019s tenure and length of service. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(a)(1), (3).\n\n87.    Congress delegated to OPM the authority to promulgate regulations that agencies must\n\nfollow in implementing RIFs. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(a).\n\n88.    Pursuant to that statutory authorization, and through notice-and-comment rulemaking,\n\nOPM has issued detailed regulations setting forth the procedures by which agencies must conduct\n\nRIFs. See 5 C.F.R. Part 351.\n\n89.    All agencies of the federal government are required to comply with the RIF regulations\n\nwhenever they \u201cdetermine[] that a reduction [in] force is necessary.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.204.\n\n90.    The RIF regulations apply to employees in the competitive and excepted services. 5 C.F.R.\n\n\u00a7 351.202(a), (b).\n\n91.    Probationary employees are expressly covered by the RIF regulations. 5 C.F.R.\n\n\u00a7\u00a7 351.501(b)(2), 351.502(b)(2). Probationary employees are included in \u201cgroup II\u201d of three\n\ngroups of employees, and may only be released, in order of retention, after the release of\n\n\n                                                21\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 1       Filed 03/06/25      Page 22 of 55\n\n\n\n\u201cgroup III\u201d employees, a group that includes employees under various temporary, term, and other\n\nprovisional appointments. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.501(b).\n\n92.    Under these required RIF procedures, before conducting a RIF a federal agency must:\n\nestablish \u201ccompetitive areas in which employees compete for retention\u201d; designate the\n\n\u201ccompetitive areas\u201d of which employees are to compete for retention at least 90 days before the\n\neffective date of the RIF; designate any \u201ccompetitive levels\u201d of positions included in the RIFs that\n\nwould permit the agency to reassign retained employees without causing undue interruption; and\n\nrank employees for retention based on factors including their tenure group, time in service\n\n(including military service), veteran preference, length of service, and performance. See 5 U.S.C.\n\n\u00a7 3502(a); 5 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 351.402-351.404, 351.504.\n\nC.     RIF Notice Requirements\n\n93.    Under the federal RIF statute and associated regulations, federal agencies are required to\n\nprovide at least 60 days of prior written notice before they may release any federal civil service\n\nemployee under a RIF. The agency must provide the written notice to (a) the employee, (b) the\n\nemployee\u2019s collective bargaining representative, and (c) the state or District where an affected\n\nemployee\u2019s duty station was located if the RIF would involve at least 50 employees within the\n\ncompetitive area, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d); 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.803(b).\n\n94.    The notice to the state must be provided to the state or agency designated by the state to\n\nperform rapid response activities under the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, now called the\n\nWorkforce Innovation and Opportunity Act of 2014 (\u201cWIOA Agency\u201d), and must also be provided\n\nto \u201c[t]he chief elected official of local government(s) within which these separations will occur.\u201d\n\n5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.803(b); see 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d)(3)(A). The purpose of states\u2019 \u201crapid response\u201d\n\nactivities is to quickly make public and private resources available to workers who are laid off, to\n\nminimize the disruption to the affected workers and their communities. To help the state or locality\n\n\n                                                22\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 1       Filed 03/06/25      Page 23 of 55\n\n\n\nprepare for the disruptions associated with job losses, notices must include: (a) the number of\n\nemployees to be separated from service due to the reduction in force, broken down by geographic\n\narea and organizational unit, (b) when those separations will occur; and (c) other information that\n\nmay facilitate the delivery of services to the affected workers. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d); 5 C.F.R.\n\n\u00a7 351.803(c).\n\n95.    The notice to an affected employee must include: (a) information concerning the right to\n\nreemployment consideration and career transition assistance; (b) a release to authorize the federal\n\ngovernment to share his or her resume and employment information with the WIOA Agency and\n\npotential public or private sector employers; and (c) information about how to apply for\n\nunemployment insurance and access other benefits. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.803(a).\n\n96.    Where circumstances \u201cnot reasonably foreseeable\u201d preclude giving 60 days\u2019 written notice,\n\nthe agency may request that OPM shorten the notice period; however, \u201c[n]o notice period may be\n\nshortened to less than 30 days.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(e).\n\n97.    Where an agency fails to provide any of these statutorily required notices, an employee\n\n\u201cmay not be released, due to a reduction in force.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d).\n\n                             IV.     FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS\n\n98.    Since President Trump took office on January 20, 2025, Defendant Agencies have, at\n\nOPM\u2019s direction, terminated tens of thousands of probationary employees.\n\n99.    The mass terminations of probationary employees since January 20 were not driven by\n\nagency determinations related to the performance or qualifications of any particular probationary\n\nemployee. Rather, these layoffs have all been part of a coordinated effort directed by the White\n\nHouse and OPM to reduce the size of the federal workforce.\n\n\n\n\n                                                23\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB            Document 1        Filed 03/06/25       Page 24 of 55\n\n\n\n100.    Because the mass terminations of probationary employees are part of an effort to\n\nrestructure and reduce the workforces at Defendant Agencies, they constitute RIFs. See 5 U.S.C.\n\n\u00a7 3502; 5 C.F.R. Part 351.\n\n101.    In terminating probationary employees en masse, Defendants have not abided by the\n\nstatutory and regulatory requirements for RIFs, including the requirement to provide 60 days\u2019\n\nnotice to the Plaintiff States. This has inflicted and will continue to inflict serious and irreparable\n\nharms on the Plaintiff States, as they must now deal with a sudden surge in unemployment, without\n\nthe advance notice required under the federal RIF statute and regulations.\n\nA.      Defendants Have Conducted Unlawful RIFs Throughout the Federal Government.\n\n102.    On January 20, 2025, the day President Trump took office, President Trump appointed\n\nCharles Ezell to serve as Acting OPM Director.\n\n103.    The same day, Acting OPM Director Ezell distributed a memo to \u201cHeads and Acting Heads\n\nof Departments and Agencies\u201d regarding \u201cGuidance on Probationary Periods, Administrative\n\nLeave and Details.\u201d In the memo, OPM directed agency heads to \u201cidentify all employees on\n\nprobationary periods . . . and send a report to OPM listing all such employees\u201d no later than January\n\n24, 2025. OPM further directed agencies to \u201cpromptly determine whether those employees should\n\nbe retained by the agency.\u201d1\n\n104.    Also on January 20, 2025, President Trump signed an executive order entitled \u201cHiring\n\nFreeze.\u201d2 In addition to ordering \u201ca freeze on the hiring of federal civilian employees\u201d throughout\n\nthe executive branch, he directed the Director of the Office of Management and Budget\u2014in\n\nconsultation with OPM and the United States Department of Government Efficiency Service\n\n\n\n1\n  https://chcoc.gov/sites/default/files/Guidance%20on%20Probationary%20Periods%2C%20Administrative%20Leav\ne%20and%20Details%XXX-XX-XXXX%20FINAL.pdf\n2\n  https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/hiring-freeze/\n\n\n                                                   24\n\f        Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB             Document 1         Filed 03/06/25       Page 25 of 55\n\n\n\n(\u201cDOGE\u201d)\u2014to \u201csubmit a plan to reduce the size of the Federal Government\u2019s workforce through\n\nefficiency improvements and attrition.\u201d\n\n105.     On February 11, 2025, President Trump issued Executive Order 14210, entitled\n\n\u201cImplementing the President\u2019s \u2018Department of Government Efficiency\u2019 Workforce Optimization\n\nInitiative.\u201d The Executive Order directed agency heads to \u201cpromptly undertake preparations to\n\ninitiate large-scale reductions in force (RIFs), consistent with applicable law, and to separate from\n\nFederal service temporary employees and reemployed annuitants working in areas that will likely\n\nbe subject to the RIFs.\u201d3\n\n106.    Rather than wait for agency heads to develop RIF plans and follow applicable procedures,\n\nhowever, Defendants began mass unlawful terminations of their probationary employees.\n\n107.    On or around February 11, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau terminated\n\napproximately 73 probationary employees. 4 The agency terminated 70-100 additional\n\nprobationary employees on February 13. 5\n\n108.    On or around February 12, the Department of Education terminated 60 probationary\n\nemployees.6\n\n109.    On or around February 12, the General Services Administration notified approximately\n\n100 probationary employees that they would be terminated.7 Upon information and belief, these\n\nterminations will become effective on March 7.\n\n\n\n\n3\n  https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/implementing-the-presidents-department-of-\ngovernment-efficiency-workforce-optimization-initiative/\n4\n  https://www.npr.org/2025/02/12/nx-s1-5294479/cfpb-workers-fired-trump-doge\n5\n  https://www.npr.org/2025/02/14/nx-s1-5298144/federal-layoffs-usda-hud-defense-trump\n6\n  https://www.npr.org/2025/02/13/nx-s1-5296928/layoffs-trump-doge-education-energy\n7\n  https://www.reuters.com/world/us/mass-firings-federal-workers-begin-trump-musk-purge-us-government-2025-\n02-13/\n\n\n                                                     25\n\f        Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB              Document 1         Filed 03/06/25         Page 26 of 55\n\n\n\n110.    On February 13, OPM officials met with agency officials throughout the federal\n\ngovernment and ordered agencies to lay off nearly all of the federal government\u2019s approximately\n\n220,0000 probationary employees.8\n\n111.    On February 14, OPM sent an email to all agency Chief Human Capital Officers (CHCOs)\n\nand their deputies to \u201cclarif[y] immediate next steps for probationary employees.\u201d\n\n112.    In its February 14 email, OPM explained its directive to agencies:\n\n        We have asked that you separate probationary employees that you have not\n        identified as mission critical no later than the end of the day Monday, 2/27. We\n        have attached a template letter. The separation date should be as soon as possible\n        that is consistent with applicable agency policies (including those in CBAs).\n\n113.    OPM\u2019s February 14 email reiterated that OPM\u2019s directive should be followed in light of\n\nthe \u201cPresident\u2019s directive to dramatically reduce the size of the federal workforce.\u201d\n\n114.    OPM\u2019s directive at the February 13 meeting and in the February 14 email coincided with\n\na rapid uptick in terminations of probationary employees.\n\n115.    On or around February 13, the Department of Energy terminated nearly 2,000 probationary\n\nemployees.9 Days later, the agency rescinded approximately 350 termination notices to\n\nprobationary employees in the National Nuclear Security Administration, which oversees the\n\nnation\u2019s nuclear stockpile.10\n\n116.    On or around February 13, the Department of Veterans Affairs terminated more than 1,000\n\nprobationary employees.11 The Department of Veterans Affairs fired another 1,400 probationary\n\nemployees on February 24.12\n\n\n\n\n8\n  https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5144113-federal-probationary-employees-fired/\n9\n  https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/13/trump-federal-worker-layoffs-00204180\n10\n   https://www.cbsnews.com/news/doge-firings-us-nuclear-weapons-workers-reversing/\n11\n   https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5162213-va-axes-another-1400-employees/\n12\n   Id.\n\n\n                                                      26\n\f        Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB              Document 1          Filed 03/06/25        Page 27 of 55\n\n\n\n117.    On or around February 13, OPM fired 250 probationary employees. 13\n\n118.    On or around February 13, the Small Business Administration terminated around 720\n\nprobationary employees.14\n\n119.    On or around February 13, the Department of Agriculture terminated approximately 3,400\n\nprobationary employees in the Forest Service. 15\n\n120.    On or around February 13, the Department of Energy terminated around 130 probationary\n\nemployees in the Bonneville Power Administration.16 Several days later, the Department of Energy\n\ndeemed around 30 of those probationary employees as critical and rescinded the terminations.\n\n121.    On or around February 14, the Environmental Protection Agency fired approximately 388\n\nprobationary employees.\n\n122.

On or around March 3, the Department of Commerce fired 73 probationary employees at\n\nthe National Institute for Standards and Technology.29\n\n138.    Upon information and belief, Defendants have already terminated tens of thousands of\n\nprobationary employees.\n\n139.    Defendants have not published official counts and locations of the employees they have\n\nterminated, but based on publicly reported numbers and firsthand accounts from affected\n\nemployees, it appears that Defendants have terminated at least 24,000 probationary employees as\n\nof the date of this Complaint. Because Plaintiff States have not received notice of these mass\n\nterminations, this accounting is necessarily incomplete and may be far higher.\n\n140.    Thousands of additional terminations are expected any day. To continue to reduce the size\n\nof the federal workforce, agencies that have not yet terminated most of their probationary\n\nemployees may do so at any moment.\n\nB.      Defendants Have Not Followed Required RIF Procedures for the Mass Layoffs of\n        Probationary Employees\n\n141.    Although the mass terminations of probationary employees have constituted RIFs,\n\nDefendants have failed to follow the RIF procedures required by statute and regulation.\n\n142.    For example, Defendants did not designate the \u201ccompetitive areas\u201d in which employees\n\nwould compete for retention, which they must do at least 90 days before the effective date of any\n\nRIF. See 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.402.\n\n143.    Defendants did not designate any \u201ccompetitive levels\u201d of positions included in the RIFs\n\nthat would permit the agency to reassign retained employees without causing undue interruption.\n\nSee 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.403.\n\n\n\n29\n  https://www.govexec.com/workforce/2025/03/some-agencies-are-still-firing-probationers-while-others-have-\nrecalled-theirs-following-court-ruling/403407/?oref=ge-skybox-post\n\n\n                                                      30\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB            Document 1       Filed 03/06/25       Page 31 of 55\n\n\n\n144.   Defendants did not establish a retention register of employees in each competitive level of\n\npositions included in the RIFs. See 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.404.\n\n145.   Defendants did not then rank employees for retention based on their tenure group, time in\n\nservice (including military service), veteran preference, length of service, and performance. See 5\n\nU.S.C. \u00a7 3502(a); 5 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 351.501-351.504.\n\n146.   Defendants did not provide required notices 60 days in advance of the effective date of\n\ntermination to affected employees, their collective bargaining representatives, or to Plaintiff States.\n\nSee 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d); 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.803.\n\n147.   Especially relevant to Plaintiff States, Defendants did not provide affected employees with\n\nthe required releases to authorize the release of their resumes and other relevant employment\n\ninformation to the relevant WIOA Agency, for employment referrals to potential public and private\n\nsector employers. See 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.803(a).\n\n148.   Likewise, Defendants did not provide Plaintiff States and the relevant WIOA Agencies\n\nwith any prior notice, much less the 60-day notice required by law, which would have alerted\n\nPlaintiff States to the number of employees to be separated from the agencies, broken down by\n\ngeographic area, and provided the effective date of the planned separations as well as other\n\ninformation that could have facilitated the delivery of rapid response services. See 5 U.S.C.\n\n\u00a7 3502(d); 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.803(b)-(c).\n\n149.   Rather than comply with their legal obligations, Defendants summarily terminated\n\nprobationary employees en masse, providing termination notices to the affected employees by\n\nform letters and emails, which frequently included errors and in many instances failed to include\n\neven the employee\u2019s name or job title.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  31\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 1       Filed 03/06/25      Page 32 of 55\n\n\n\n150.   These form termination notices, issued near-simultaneously to thousands of federal\n\nprobationary employees, failed to include any particularized agency determinations related to the\n\nperformance or qualifications of each affected probationary employee to justify their termination.\n\nThe notices were pretextual because Defendants were actually engaged in RIFs designed to reduce\n\nthe size of the federal workforce.\n\n151.   For example, agency management at the National Science Foundation informed\n\nprobationary employees that the NSF had previously chosen to retain its probationary employees\n\nbut that OPM had directed NSF to terminate the employees. The managers said that terminating\n\nthe probationary employees was not a decision the agency made,\u201d but was \u201ca direction [it had]\n\nreceived\u201d from OPM and that NSF leadership had \u201cno choice\u201d but to \u201cfollow[] orders.\u201d\n\n152.   Likewise, in response to OPM\u2019s directive to terminate probationary employees en masse,\n\nthe Department of Treasury directed the Internal Revenue Service to terminate all probationary\n\nemployees \u201cbased on performance.\u201d Without conducting any review of probationary employees\u2019\n\nqualifications or performance, the Department of Treasury directed the IRS to terminate\n\napproximately 6,700 probationary employees. These terminations were unrelated to the\n\nprobationary employees\u2019 qualifications, performance, or conduct, but were in fact a RIF aimed at\n\nreducing the size of the agency\u2019s workforce.\n\n153.   The same pattern occurred at the Center for Consumer Information and Insurance\n\nOversight (CCIIO), a subset of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) within the\n\nDepartment of Health and Human Services (HHS). CCIIO had determined that none of its\n\nprobationary employees should be removed from service because all were well qualified for their\n\npositions and were performing well. Nevertheless, on February 13, 2025, HHS directed CCIIO to\n\nterminate all of its probationary employees and to issue form termination letters that stated falsely\n\n\n\n\n                                                 32\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB            Document 1         Filed 03/06/25   Page 33 of 55\n\n\n\nthat the affected employees were being terminated \u201cbecause [their] ability, knowledge, and skills\n\ndo not fit the Agency\u2019s current needs, and [their] performance has not been adequate to justify\n\nfurther employment.\u201d The CCIIO terminated 82 probationary employees on February 15, 2025,\n\nrepresenting approximately 15% of its workforce of approximately 600.\n\n154.    Defendants\u2019 failure to provide required RIF notices rendered any terminations ineffective\n\nand unlawful because an employee \u201cmay not be released, due to a reduction in force\u201d unless an\n\nagency provides all statutorily required notices. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d).\n\n155.    As explained in further detail below in Section IV.C, Defendants\u2019 failure to provide these\n\nrequired notices has harmed Plaintiff States in several ways, including by hindering the ability to\n\nprovide rapid response services.\n\nC.      Plaintiffs Are Harmed As a Direct Result of Defendants\u2019 Failure to Follow RIF\n        Requirements and Provide Advance Notice to the States.\n\n156.    Plaintiff States have suffered and will imminently suffer several types of irreparable injury\n\ndue to the federal government\u2019s failure to provide notice of the RIFs.\n\n157.    As noted above, when a federal agency plans to release 50 or more employees in a RIF,\n\nthe agency must provide 60 days\u2019 notice to the affected States\u2019 WIOA Agencies as well as the\n\nchief elected officials for affected local jurisdictions.\n\n158.    Plaintiff States have not received notice of a federal reduction in force from any federal\n\nagency.\n\n159.    In enacting the RIF notice requirements, Congress recognized the harms inherent to\n\nsudden, unexpected mass layoffs, including that economic dislocation of workers can easily create\n\na cascade of instability throughout a regional economy. And it sought to provide the states with\n\nsome protection against those harms by requiring that agencies provide them with advance notice.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   33\n\f        Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 1        Filed 03/06/25      Page 34 of 55\n\n\n\n160.    Defendants\u2019 failure to provide notice has inflicted other harms as well. As a result of the\n\nlack of notice, Plaintiff States are unable to proactively reach affected individuals and provide\n\nservices that would mitigate the harm the employees and their communities suffer as a result of\n\nthe sudden job loss.\n\n161.    Plaintiff States also suffer procedural injury resulting in additional expenditures and harms\n\nto public finances that they would not have to bear if notice had been provided.\n\n                                  Rapid Response Expenditures\n\n162.    The Federal Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act of 2014, 29 U.S.C.\n\n\u00a7 3174(A)(2)(i), requires that each state have a rapid response program to conduct outreach to\n\nworkers affected by a mass layoff and to provide the workers with support services, including job\n\ntransition services.\n\n163.    The notice required by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d)(3)(A) is intended to trigger rapid response\n\nactivities since it is explicitly to be given to the state entity required to carry out rapid response\n\nactivities.\n\n164.    The purpose of the rapid response system is to reduce individuals\u2019 reliance on public\n\nbenefit systems, such as unemployment insurance; to promote economic recovery and vitality by\n\ndeveloping an ongoing, comprehensive approach to identify, plan for, and respond to layoffs and\n\ndislocations; and to prevent or minimize the impact of mass layoffs on workers, businesses, and\n\ncommunities.\n\n165.    When notified of a forthcoming mass layoff, a state\u2019s rapid response team is required to:\n\ncontact the employer, representatives of the affected workers, and the local community; assess the\n\nlayoff plans and schedule; and provide information and support to affected employees, including\n\n\n\n\n                                                 34\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 1       Filed 03/06/25     Page 35 of 55\n\n\n\ninformation about filing for unemployment compensation and career services. 20 CFR \u00a7\u00a7\n\n682.300, 682.330.\n\n166.   The rapid response teams also facilitate connections to partner agencies and organizations\n\nthat can provide terminated workers and their families with critical services, such as home heating\n\nassistance, legal aid, and financial advice.\n\n167.   Because Plaintiff States\u2019 rapid response teams have received no notice of federal RIFs,\n\ncertain teams have been required to dedicate significantly more staff, resources, and expenditures\n\nto fulfill their statutory mission. In particular, they have had to devote significant time and\n\nresources simply to try to identify workers subject to federal mass layoffs and to otherwise make\n\nresources available to potentially affected individuals in new ways, all because federal agencies\n\nhave failed to provide the legally required notice of mass layoffs.\n\n168.   As one example of these efforts, some state agencies handling unemployment claims have\n\ncreated new websites, requiring significant time and expense. See Maryland Workers Impacted by\n\nRecent Federal Actions, https://response.maryland.gov/federalpublicservants/. These efforts were\n\na further attempt to provide rapid response resources and services, which could normally be\n\ntargeted at specific personnel before they are laid off, but must now be provided less efficiently\n\nand at greater expense to the entire public, because the states\u2019 personnel remain unaware of who\n\nhas been laid off and whether and when the next federal mass layoff event will occur.\n\n169.   As another example, because Maryland\u2019s Department of Labor did not receive advance\n\nnotice, staff have conducted extensive affirmative outreach to dozens of federal agencies and\n\noffices to try and determine the location and extent of upcoming layoffs. Despite these efforts,\n\nstaff have not received any substantive responses. The Department has also had to divert\n\nsignificant additional time of other agency personnel from state projects to instead respond to\n\n\n\n\n                                                35\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 1       Filed 03/06/25      Page 36 of 55\n\n\n\nfederal mass firings, to try and identify recently terminated employees and provide relevant\n\nresources and services.\n\n                             Unemployment Benefits Expenditures\n\n170.   As a general matter, the federal government is required to reimburse states for\n\nunemployment benefits provided to former federal employees. Specifically, Plaintiff States are\n\nparty to an agreement with the United States Secretary of Labor, wherein the Secretary shall pay,\n\nas an agent of the United States, Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees (\u201cUCFE\u201d)\n\npursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8502(a).\n\n171.   Each Plaintiff State has its own procedures for handling Unemployment Insurance (\u201cUI\u201d)\n\nclaims. Regardless, sudden mass layoffs burden the administrative process for handling UI claims,\n\nand the lack of notice and chaotic nature of Defendants\u2019 mass layoffs of probationary employees\n\nhas already exacerbated or likely will exacerbate the strain on the Plaintiff States\u2019 systems for\n\nadministering UI.\n\n172.   Maryland\u2019s experience exemplifies the problems with the unlawful way the Defendants\n\nhave conducted RIFs of probationary employees.\n\n173.   The Maryland Department of Labor manages claims for unemployment benefits by\n\nindividuals formerly employed to work in Maryland.\n\n174.   Pursuant to Md. Code Ann., Lab. & Empl. \u00a7 8-805(a), an individual in Maryland who\n\nwishes to collect unemployment insurance benefits must file a claim in accordance with\n\nregulations adopted by the Maryland Secretary of Labor. Claimants file claims online using the\n\nDepartment\u2019s system to assert a claim initially and to provide information to indicate the basis of\n\nthe claim, the name of the claimant\u2019s previous employer, the reason for her separation, work\n\nexperience, and other relevant information. COMAR 09.32.02.05.\n\n\n\n\n                                                36\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 1        Filed 03/06/25     Page 37 of 55\n\n\n\n175.   The reason for termination alleged by the claimant is then transmitted to the claimant\u2019s\n\nemployer(s) for verification. The employer is then asked to furnish a report of the separation from\n\nemployment containing, among other information, the reason for the employee\u2019s separation and a\n\nreport of wage history. Md. Code Ann. Lab. & Empl. \u00a7 8-627; see also COMAR 09.32.02.05.\n\n176.   Maryland law disqualifies some claimants from benefits depending on the circumstances\n\nof their separation from employment. See Md. Code Ann. Lab. & Empl. \u00a7 8-1001, et seq.\n\nDisqualifying circumstances include, among other reasons, termination for misconduct,\n\naggravated misconduct, and gross misconduct. Id. In addition, a claimant is disqualified if they\n\nquit their job without good cause directly related to employment conditions or employer actions.\n\nMd. Code Ann. Lab. & Empl. \u00a7 8-1001(a).\n\n177.   If a determination involves a resolution of a dispute of material fact, a claims examiner\n\nfrom the Maryland Department of Labor must conduct a predetermination fact-finding interview\n\nafter notice is provided to the employee and her employer(s). Md. Code. Ann. Lab & Empl. \u00a7 8-\n\n806(a)(2). Thereafter, a written initial determination must be made stating, among other things, the\n\nweekly benefit amount, maximum benefits payable to the claimant in a benefit year, and the\n\nreasons for the determination. Md. Code Ann. Lab. & Empl. \u00a7 8-806(c).\n\n178.   If the claims examiner\u2019s review of a claim reveals no dispute of material fact, but the\n\ninformation reviewed indicates that claimant may be ineligible or disqualified, the claims\n\nexaminers must still schedule a call for an appointment for a fact-finding interview and render a\n\nwritten decision. COMAR 09.32.16(D)-(E). A claimant or an employer may file an administrative\n\nappeal within 15 days. Md. Code Ann. Lab. & Empl. \u00a7 8-806(e)(1).\n\n179.   The Maryland Department of Labor\u2019s latest data indicates that 813 former federal\n\nemployees have applied for unemployment benefits since January 21, 2025.\n\n\n\n\n                                                37\n\f          Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB        Document 1       Filed 03/06/25     Page 38 of 55\n\n\n\n180.      As noted above, the number of UCFE claims received by the Maryland Department of\n\nLabor has increased significantly in just the last few weeks, starting on or around February 14,\n\n2025, with an approximate range of 30 to 60 new such claims every day.\n\n181.      In fact, the amount of UCFE claims received by the Maryland Department of Labor in\n\nFebruary 2025 is significantly higher than past years. From January 21 to March 3, 2024,\n\nMaryland received only 189 unemployment claims containing federal wages in the claimant\u2019s base\n\nperiod.\n\n182.      While not required to apply for unemployment benefits, multiple individuals have attached\n\nin their application their letter of employment termination from the federal government. Such\n\nletters indicate that these individuals were probationary employees purportedly terminated for\n\ncause.\n\n183.      When an employer provides the initial report of separation to the Maryland Department of\n\nLabor, the employer must indicate the reason for the separation, including whether the employee\n\nwas fired for cause, such as misconduct.\n\n184.      Accordingly, if an employer states in its report of separation that an individual was\n\nterminated because performance has not been adequate to justify further employment at the\n\nagency, the Maryland Department of Labor\u2019s procedures require that the claims examiner must\n\ninvestigate the reason for discharge.\n\n185.      The Maryland Department of Labor is also required to verify both wages and reason for\n\nseparation of employment from each federal agency by sending a request for wage and separation\n\ninformation. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 609.6(e)(1), 609.21 through 609.25. While private employers report\n\nwages each quarter for all employees into the Department\u2019s database, see COMAR 09.32.01.12,\n\nfederal agencies are not required to regularly report active employee wages to the States.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 38\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 1        Filed 03/06/25      Page 39 of 55\n\n\n\n186.   The same Department staff who handle regular unemployment claims also process and\n\nadjudicate UCFE claims. Redirecting staff from handling regular UI claims to process and\n\nadjudicate UCFE claims threatens to strain the state\u2019s resources.\n\n187.   This diversion of personnel will undoubtedly impede the timely processing of regular UI\n\nclaims, creating significant backlogs and delays. The consequences will be far-reaching, affecting\n\ncountless individuals who depend on swift resolutions to sustain their livelihoods. By diverting\n\nresources, the state must compromise the efficiency and responsiveness of its claims processing\n\nsystem, ultimately undermining public trust and exacerbating economic hardship.\n\n188.   While the Maryland Department of Labor is only beginning to process these claims, its\n\nstaff has already begun contacting relevant federal agencies to request information on relevant\n\nterminations, to determine if they were in fact done for cause\n\n189.   Thus far, Maryland has received at least 193 reports of separation from federal agencies,\n\nconcerning their recently terminated employees.\n\n190.   Several Defendant agencies reported that probationary employees were terminated due to\n\na \u201cpermanent lack of work due to a change in Presidential Administration.\u201d\n\n191.   In addition, the Maryland Department of Labor received several reports from Defendant\n\nagencies explicitly stating that the employees were \u201claid off due to a reduction in force.\u201d\n\n192.   And, as relevant here, certain reports by Defendants asserted that the employee at issue\n\nwas terminated for cause, for instance due to \u201cunsatisfactory work performance\u201d and similar\n\ngeneric performance-related bases.\n\n193.   Similarly, other reports highlighted various potentially disqualifying circumstances. For\n\ninstance, agencies indicated that claimants might not be genuinely unemployed or had voluntarily\n\nresigned from their positions.\n\n\n\n\n                                                39\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB         Document 1         Filed 03/06/25    Page 40 of 55\n\n\n\n194.   Due Defendants\u2019 assertions that certain federal employees were terminated for cause or\n\notherwise ineligible or disqualified from benefits, or where there is disputed or conflicting\n\ninformation, Maryland will be required to follow our intensive and mandatory investigative\n\nprocess.\n\n195.   The procedures impose a significant strain on the Maryland Department of Labor\u2019s\n\nfinancial and temporal resources. Each case demanding interviews and/or a fact-finding\n\nproceeding necessitates extensive staff hours for scheduling, conducting interviews, reviewing\n\nevidence, and drafting detailed decisions. The need to send notices, accommodate witness\n\ntestimony, and facilitate cross-examination further escalates the time commitment. Moreover, the\n\npotential for subsequent appeals triggers a cascade of additional hearings and reviews, diverting\n\nresources from other essential departmental functions.\n\n196.   Moreover, where federal agencies fail to provide responses to requests for separation\n\ninformation, the Maryland Department of Labor must gather necessary wage and separation\n\ninformation. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 609.6 (e)(2). This requires claims staff to solicit evidence from the\n\nclaimants in the form of pay stubs, W-2s and affidavits and to pay benefits based on that\n\ninformation. In fact, recent federal guidance regarding federal unemployment during recent\n\ngovernment shutdowns encourages states to have claimants file an affidavit, using available proof,\n\ngiven \u201climited federal HR resources\u201d to respond to requests for separation information.\n\n\u201cUnemployment Insurance Program Letter 03-22,\u201d U.S. Department of Labor, November 2022,\n\nhttps://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/ETA/advisories/UIPL/2021/UIPL_03-22.pdf.\n\n197.   In addition, termination notices issued by federal agencies were not issued in compliance\n\nwith governing reduction in force procedures. It is apparent that there are affected individuals,\n\nincluding veterans, who should have been accorded preference under required RIF procedures but\n\n\n\n\n                                               40\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 1        Filed 03/06/25      Page 41 of 55\n\n\n\nwere not. To the extent that preferences and other such requirements would have precluded\n\ntermination, and federal employees successfully challenge their separations, this will cause the\n\nDepartment to re-adjudicate claims, pursue overpayments, and conduct appeals.\n\n198.   While the federal Government provides grants for the purpose of administrating state\n\nunemployment benefit programs, these grants are frequently less than the total administrative costs\n\nincurred by Maryland. And that is the case now; the federal grant monies allocated to Maryland\n\nare not sufficient to cover Maryland\u2019s unemployment benefit program administration.\n\n199.   In these circumstances, Maryland relies on its Special Administrative Expense Fund\n\n(\u201cSAEF\u201d) when federal funding is insufficient. See Md. Code Ann., Labor & Employment \u00a7\u00a7 8-\n\n419 to 842. This fund may be comprised of previously transferred federal funds (in limited\n\ncircumstances), as well as monies collected by the state through fines, interest, and other penalties,\n\nand contributions by the state legislature. Id. \u00a7 8-421. Currently, SAEF is comprised entirely of\n\nstate funds. Accordingly, any increase in administrative costs of Maryland\u2019s unemployment\n\nbenefits program will be covered at least in part by state funds.\n\n200.   Other Plaintiff States must also undergo intensive and mandatory investigation and appeal\n\nprocesses for handling disputes between claimants and employers involving the claimant\u2019s\n\neligibility. Many Plaintiff States anticipate a significant increase in these disputes given the\n\nDefendants\u2019 chaotic and conflicting messaging around the reasons for terminating probationary\n\nemployees. Handling these disputes will cause those Plaintiff States to divert staff to handle the\n\ntime-consuming dispute resolutions and hinder the timely processing of ordinary unemployment\n\nclaims that are not disputed.\n\n201.   For example, the Illinois Department of Employment Security (\u201cIDES\u201d) has already\n\nreceived almost the same number of applications for unemployment benefits from former federal\n\n\n\n\n                                                 41\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 1       Filed 03/06/25      Page 42 of 55\n\n\n\nworkers this year as it received in all of last year. A substantial number of these claims require\n\nresource intensive fact-finding that will cause backlogs and delays in IDES\u2019s processing of other\n\nclaims, exacerbating economic hardship for countless Illinoisans.\n\n202.   IDES is also being forced to divert resources and staff to respond to the latest layoff news,\n\nto identify affected federal agencies and ex-employees, provide information, and adjust procedures\n\nand resources to assist confused and unemployed workers in Illinois, all in a complicated and\n\nrapidly evolving environment. To take one example, IDES had to create a new webpage, at\n\nsignificant time and expense, in an attempt to provide resources and services. See\n\nhttps://ides.illinois.gov/unemployment/deferred-resignation-of-federal-employees.html.        Such\n\nefforts could normally be targeted at specific personnel subject to impending layoff events but\n\nmust instead be provided less efficiently and at greater expense to the entire public because IDES\n\npersonnel remain unaware of the individuals who have already been laid off and whether and when\n\nthe next federal mass layoff event will occur.\n\n203.    In some jurisdictions, a flood of contested UI claims will cause a backlog that affects the\n\ntimely adjudication of a wide range of administrative matters that are handled by the same\n\nadministrative law judges (\u201cALJs\u201d), ranging from building code enforcement to traffic tickets.\n\n204.   Plaintiff States have seen or anticipate seeing an uptick in UI claims in the areas in which\n\nthe probationary employee layoffs occurred. This sudden increase\u2014without any advanced\n\nnotice\u2014has burdened and will continue to burden state agencies charged with administering UI\n\nbenefits.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 42\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB             Document 1     Filed 03/06/25      Page 43 of 55\n\n\n\n                              Expenditures for Other Social Services\n\n205.   Plaintiff States bear other burdens associated with many residents suddenly losing income.\n\nThese costs arise in the administration of programs aimed at providing connections to social\n\nservices, like health care and food assistance.\n\n206.   Newly unemployed individuals apply for Medicaid at high rates, and the Plaintiff States\n\nbear a direct economic cost to provide healthcare services to them and their families.\n\n                 Harms to State Programs That Depend on Federal Employees\n\n207.   Many federal probationary employees who were terminated by the CDC were detailed to\n\nwork at Plaintiff States\u2019 public health agencies. This includes several employees who were hired\n\nby the CDC as part of its Public Health Associate Program for Recent Graduates (\u201cPHAP\u201d). PHAP\n\nis a two-year program that places recent college graduates with tribal, local, and territorial public\n\nhealth agencies, as well as non-governmental organizations, to work alongside other public health\n\nprofessionals in a variety of settings.\n\n208.   For example, three recently terminated PHAP employees (\u201cAssociates\u201d) were assigned to\n\nNew Jersey\u2019s Department of Health (\u201cNJDOH\u201d), which is responsible for preventing the spread\n\nof infectious diseases and developing emergency preparedness plans in the state. CDC and\n\nNJDOH entered into a two-year contract, pursuant to which CDC agreed to cover all costs for the\n\nAssociates, including salary and benefits. NJDOH has participated in the PHAP program for\n\nseveral years and often hires PHAP Associates, who gain invaluable training and institutional\n\nknowledge over the course of the program, for permanent employment at the conclusion of their\n\ntwo-year term.\n\n209.   The three Associates were detailed to different NJDOH divisions that perform core public\n\nhealth functions: the Division of HIV, STD, and TB Services; the Epidemiology, Environmental\n\n\n\n\n                                                  43\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 1        Filed 03/06/25      Page 44 of 55\n\n\n\nand Occupational Health\u2019s Communicable Disease Service; and the Global Tuberculosis Institute\n\nat Rutgers University. Each Associate was a member of a small team dedicated to reducing the\n\nspread of communicable diseases such as HIV, TB, and foodborne and waterborne illnesses. This\n\nwork involved laborious investigations, contact tracing, and collaborations with numerous local,\n\nstate, and federal partners to ensure anyone infected or at risk of infection has access to treatment.\n\n210.   Between February 16 and 17, 2025, NJDOH learned that the three Associates had been\n\nterminated from their positions on February 15, 2025\u2014before the expiration of their contractual\n\ntwo-year terms. CDC never notified NJDOH of these terminations. Between March 4 and 5,\n\nNJDOH learned that the Associates were being reinstated.\n\n211.   Despite their reinstatement, the sudden loss of essential personnel, coupled with the lack\n\nof notice, caused NJDOH significant harm and disruption. NJDOH had invested significant time\n\nand resources into months-long training for the Associates, and the agency did not have the\n\nbudgetary flexibility or hiring authority to replace them, particularly given the lack of any notice.\n\nThe unexpected staffing shortages and imminent need to reallocate and train existing staff already\n\ncaused delays and administrative chaos, which impeded NJDOH\u2019s ability to fulfill its mission of\n\nlimiting the spread of infectious diseases in the state. The timing of the terminations was especially\n\nproblematic because NJDOH has been dealing with numerous communicable disease challenges,\n\nincluding H5N1, measles, Covid-19, influenza, norovirus, and RSV. The loss in workforce\n\ncapacity during this time hampered NJDOH\u2019s ability to fully respond to these public health threats.\n\n212.   The lack of notice compounded the challenges created by the terminations. NJDOH was\n\nnot able to plan for the terminations, resulting in administrative inefficiencies, duplicative work,\n\nand delayed notifications to persons exposed to certain communicable diseases.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 44\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 1       Filed 03/06/25      Page 45 of 55\n\n\n\n                                     Harms to State Finances\n\n213.   The mass layoffs that have taken place without the legally required notice to Plaintiff States\n\nwill also have substantial impacts on the Plaintiff States\u2019 finances.\n\n214.   For instance, the U.S. Secretary of Labor has discretion to reimburse states for\n\nadministrative costs required to conduct the state unemployment compensation program. 42 U.S.C.\n\n\u00a7 502(a). While many Plaintiff States have been and continue to expend additional resources\n\nnecessary to address the uptick in federal unemployment claims, it is not yet known whether those\n\nadditional costs will be fully reimbursed.\n\n215.   Further, Plaintiff States rely in large part on income tax revenue for their budgets. Because\n\nDefendant agencies will no longer be withholding and paying income taxes to Plaintiff States on\n\nbehalf of the terminated probationary employees, the layoffs will result in a decrease to Plaintiff\n\nStates\u2019 revenues. Given the number of employees forced to seek reemployment\u2014with no notice\n\nand no opportunity for Plaintiff States to provide support services\u2014it is highly likely that many of\n\nthe Plaintiff States\u2019 residents will be unemployed for prolonged periods, depriving the Plaintiff\n\nStates of significant income tax receipts.\n\n216.   For example, the District of Columbia estimates that the mass terminations of probationary\n\nemployees will cause millions of dollars in lost annual income tax revenue. The District estimates\n\nthat its lost income tax revenue for the first 60 days alone, the period in which it should have\n\nreceived advance notice of any RIFs, will cost the District at least hundreds of thousands of dollars\n\nin lost income tax revenue. Had the District received the notice required by law, these losses would\n\nlikely have been mitigated, including because employees would not have been terminated during\n\nthe 60-day notice period and some would have been able to obtain alternative employment prior\n\nto their termination.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 45\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB          Document 1         Filed 03/06/25    Page 46 of 55\n\n\n\n217.   Likewise, the Maryland Comptroller projects that the mass terminations of probationary\n\nemployees will cause significant decreases in Maryland\u2019s income tax revenues. Maryland\u2019s budget\n\nrelies in large part on personal income tax revenue, which represented 55% of Maryland\u2019s general\n\nfund revenues for fiscal year 2024. Approximately 250,000 federal workers reside in Maryland.\n\nAlthough unemployed individuals receiving unemployment benefits generally pay income tax on\n\ntheir benefits, the benefits paid are less than the amount the individuals earned when they were\n\nfully employed, and therefore the taxes paid are generally less than the taxes paid during their\n\nemployment.\n\n218.   Beyond the direct loss of income tax revenue, the Maryland Comptroller anticipates that a\n\nsudden and significant increase of newly unemployed workers will have serious negative effects\n\non Maryland\u2019s labor market, including extended periods of unemployment, downward pressure on\n\nwages, and the migration of residents out of the state.\n\n219.   The terminations also impact state sales tax revenues.\n\n220.   For example, for the District of Columbia, this impact comes from two primary sources:\n\nFirst, federal employees living outside of the District who commute to work in the District\n\npurchase meals at restaurants, pay parking fees, and purchase other goods and services before,\n\nduring, and after work. Second, in addition to these workday purchases, federal employees who\n\nare District residents also contribute to our economy as full-time residents, spending on groceries,\n\nhousehold items, restaurants, clothing, and various services.\n\n221.   The District estimates that these mass terminations could cause anywhere from hundreds\n\nof thousands to millions of dollars in lost annual sales tax revenue. The District further estimates\n\nthat for the first 60 days alone, the period in which it should have received advance notice of any\n\nRIFs, the District will lose tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars in sales tax revenues. Had the\n\n\n\n\n                                                 46\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 1        Filed 03/06/25       Page 47 of 55\n\n\n\nDistrict received the notice required by law, these losses would likely have been mitigated,\n\nincluding because employees would not have been terminated during the 60-day notice period and\n\nsome would have been able to obtain alternative employment prior to their termination.\n\n\n\n                                     CLAIMS FOR RELIEF\n                                           COUNT I\n                        Violation of the Administrative Procedures Act\n                             Action Not in Accordance with Law\n\n222.   Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate herein by reference every allegation and paragraph set\n\nforth previously.\n\n223.   Under the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d), a court shall \u201chold unlawful and set\n\naside agency action . . . found to be . . . arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise\n\nnot in accordance with law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A).\n\n224.   Defendants are agencies subject to the APA. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701.\n\n225.   Because Defendants\u2019 mass terminations of probationary employees are part of an effort to\n\nrestructure and reduce the federal workforce, they constitute RIFs, and Defendants were obligated\n\nto follow RIF procedures set forth by statute and regulation to carry out the terminations. See 5\n\nU.S.C. \u00a7 3502; 5 C.F.R. Part 351.\n\n226.   Defendants violated the law by carrying out the mass terminations of probationary\n\nemployees without following the required RIF procedures, see 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502; 5 C.F.R. Part 351,\n\nincluding providing 60 days\u2019 notice to states and affected employees before releasing the\n\nemployees, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d). Absent such notice, an employee \u201cmay not be released.\u201d 5 U.S.C.\n\n\u00a7 3502(d).\n\n227.   The actions of Defendants therefore violate the APA because they are not in accordance\n\nwith law in violation of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A).\n\n\n                                                  47\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 1        Filed 03/06/25       Page 48 of 55\n\n\n\n                                          COUNT II\n                        Violation of the Administrative Procedures Act\n                                   Arbitrary and Capricious\n\n228.   Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate herein by reference every allegation and paragraph set\n\nforth previously.\n\n229.   Under the APA, a court shall \u201chold unlawful and set aside agency action . . . found to be\n\n. . . arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d 5 U.S.C.\n\n\u00a7 706(2)(A).\n\n230.   Defendants are agencies subject to the APA. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701.\n\n231.   The terminations of probationary employees pursuant to OPM\u2019s order have been arbitrary\n\nand capricious in several respects, including:\n\n232.   Defendants OPM and OPM Director failed to provide a reasoned explanation for their\n\ndirection to agencies to carry out mass terminations of probationary employees without following\n\nRIF procedures.\n\n233.   Defendants failed to provide a reasoned explanation for following OPM\u2019s direction and\n\ncarrying out mass terminations of probationary employees.\n\n234.   Third, to the extent Defendants provided any explanation at all for the mass terminations,\n\nthe reasons given were pretextual as they purported to relate to individual employees\u2019 performance\n\nbut did not identify any actual unsatisfactory performance or conduct or any reasons preceding the\n\naffected employees\u2019 appointments that justified their terminations. Rather than Defendants\u2019 stated\n\nreasons, Defendants\u2019 true reason for terminating the probationary employees was to reduce the\n\nsize of the federal workforce.\n\n235.   The arbitrariness of Defendants\u2019 actions and the indiscriminate nature of the terminations\n\nis underscored by the fact that Defendants have had to reverse the firings of individuals fulfilling\n\n\n\n\n                                                  48\n\f        Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB           Document 1       Filed 03/06/25       Page 49 of 55\n\n\n\ncertain critical functions, such as protecting nuclear weapons and addressing a significant public\n\nhealth threat.\n\n                                         COUNT III\n                              Non-Statutory Review of Ultra Vires Action\n\n236.    Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate herein by reference every allegation and paragraph set\n\nforth previously.\n\n237.    Plaintiffs have a non-statutory right of action to enjoin and declare unlawful official action\n\nthat is ultra vires.\n\n238.    Defendants mass terminations of probationary employees were RIFs. These RIFs were\n\nunlawful because Defendants conducted them without following required RIF procedures, see 5\n\nU.S.C. \u00a7 3502; 5 C.F.R. Part 351, including providing 60 days\u2019 notice to states and affected\n\nemployees before releasing the employees, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d). Absent such notice, an employee\n\n\u201cmay not be released.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(d).\n\n239.    Defendants\u2019 actions terminating probationary employees en masse therefore exceeded their\n\nlawful authority and were ultra vires.\n\n240.    Plaintiffs will suffer irreparable injury if Defendants\u2019 actions are not declared unlawful and\n\nenjoined, and Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law.\n\n241.    The public interest favors issuance of a judicial declaration that Defendants\u2019 terminations\n\nof federal probationary employees are unlawful and issuance of an injunction requiring Defendants\n\nto reinstate the affected employees and to follow RIF procedures for any further RIFs. Defendants\u2019\n\nactions have resulted in the unlawful termination of tens of thousands of probationary federal\n\nemployees, including large numbers of military veterans, causing a sudden surge of unemployment\n\nwithout providing Plaintiff States with notice or an opportunity to prepare.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 49\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB         Document 1       Filed 03/06/25      Page 50 of 55\n\n\n\n                                   PRAYER FOR RELIEF\n\n       WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court:\n\n242.   Declare unlawful and set aside Defendants\u2019 terminations of probationary employees\n\nwithout making specific, individualized determinations regarding the employees\u2019 performance or\n\nconduct and without adhering to RIF requirements as arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion,\n\nor otherwise not in accordance with law under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A);\n\n243.   Declare unlawful and set aside Defendants\u2019 terminations of probationary employees\n\nwithout making specific, individualized determinations regarding the employees\u2019 performance or\n\nconduct and without adhering to RIF requirements as ultra vires and exceeding their lawful\n\nauthority;\n\n244.   Issue immediate temporary relief restraining Defendants from terminating any\n\nprobationary employees without making specific, individualized determinations regarding the\n\ninadequacy of the employee\u2019s conduct or performance and reinstating probationary employees\n\nwho were terminated on or after January 20, 2025, as part of mass terminations that did not comply\n\nwith RIF procedures and were not based on individualized determinations of the inadequacy of the\n\nemployee\u2019s conduct or performance;\n\n245.   Order Defendants to file a status report with the Court within 48 hours of entry of a\n\ntemporary restraining order, and at regular intervals thereafter, identifying all probationary\n\nemployees terminated on or after January 20, 2025 (including the following information for each\n\nemployee: agency, name, position title, grade, termination date, whether the probationary\n\nemployee has been reinstated, and the date of any reinstatement), and reporting all steps that\n\nDefendants have taken to comply with the Court\u2019s temporary restraining order;\n\n\n\n\n                                               50\n\f       Case 1:25-cv-00748-JKB         Document 1         Filed 03/06/25      Page 51 of 55\n\n\n\n246.   Enter preliminary and permanent injunctive relief enjoining any further terminations that\n\ndo not follow the RIF requirements or requirements for separating probationary employees for\n\nperformance and enjoining Defendants from separating any employees pursuant to a RIF prior to\n\nthe reinstatement of the probationary employees described above;\n\n247.    Award to Plaintiffs their costs of litigation including, but not limited to, reasonable\n\nattorneys\u2019 fees, under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412, and any other applicable law; and\n\n248.
